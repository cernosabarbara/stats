The Invisible Web at Work: Artificial Intelligence and Electronic Surveillance in the Workplace,2020,"Employers and others who hire or engage workers to perform services use a dizzying array of electronic mechanisms to make personnel decisions about hiring, worker evaluation, compensation, discipline, and retention. These electronic mechanisms include electronic trackers, surveillance cameras, metabolism monitors, wearable biological measuring devices, and implantable technology. These tools enable employers to record their workers’ every movement, listen in on their conversations, measure minute aspects of performance, and detect oppositional organizing activities. The data collected is transformed by means of artificial intelligence (A-I) algorithms into a permanent electronic resume that can identify and predict an individual’s performance as well as their work ethic, personality, union proclivity, employer loyalty, and future health care costs. The electronic resume produced by A-I will accompany workers from job to job as they move around the boundaryless workplace. Thus A-I and electronic monitoring produce an invisible electronic web that threatens to invade worker privacy, deter unionization, enable subtle forms of employer blackballing, exacerbate employment discrimination, render unions ineffective, and obliterate the protections of the labor laws.

This article describes the many ways A-I is being used in the workplace and how its use is transforming the practices of hiring, evaluating, compensating, controlling, and dismissing workers. It then focuses on four areas of law in which A-I threatens to undermine worker protections: anti-discrimination law, privacy law, antitrust law, and labor law. Finally, this article maps out an agenda for future law reform and research.","['invisible', 'work:', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'electronic', 'surveillance', 'workplace']"
"The connected workplace: Characteristics and social consequences of work surveillance in the age of datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence",2023,"Because of COVID-19 lockdowns, managers and administrators have begun to look for new ways to monitor and control their stranded-at-home workforce. Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee’s body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance. Taking an employee-centric position, it also proposes a research agenda for critical, behavioral, and design-oriented scholars who wish to explore the identified issues.","['connected', 'workplace:', 'characteristics', 'social', 'consequences', 'work', 'surveillance', 'datification,', 'sensorization,', 'artificial', 'intelligence']"

Ethics at the workplace in the fourth industrial revolution: A Catholic social teaching perspective,2021,"Abstract While many studies on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) focus on efficiency, productivity and economic progress, only a few have considered its ethical aspects. This article tries to contribute to filling this vacuum by providing a comprehensive approach to ethical risks at the workplace. Drawing upon Catholic social teaching (CST)—addressed to all people of good will—it analyzes ethical aspects at the workplace posited by the FIR, and more particularly by Industry 4.0, which is at the core of this revolution. CST emphasizes the dignity of the worker and the necessity to flourish at the workplace. While robots, artificial intelligence, and interconnected technologies are only instrumental, the real subject of work is the worker. This casts specific light on the ethical issues analyzed, including effects on employment, wages and inequality, human quality treatment, relational aspects, safety and health, surveillance on employees, and meaningful work.","['ethics', 'workplace', 'fourth', 'industrial', 'revolution:', 'catholic', 'social', 'teaching', 'perspective']"
"Artificial Intelligence Is Watching You at Work. Digital Surveillance, Employee Monitoring, and Regulatory Issues in the EU Context",2019,"By affecting activities in both traditional and modern industries, countless invasive devices constitute a burgeoning terrain for new forms of monitoring assisted by artificial intelligence and algorithms; these range from badges to tablets, from wearables to exoskeletons, from collaborative software to virtual personal assistant, from computer networks to face recognition systems. From a legal perspective, these tools constantly collect, produce, share and combine data that may be used by the employer for all the many different reasons, thus leading to a “genetic variation” of the organizational, monitoring and disciplinary prerogative, considered as the core of the employment contract.

When it comes to recruiting, managing, and vetting the workforce, AI applications can be considered as an effective combination of big data analytics and algorithmic governance. Only recently, have international, European and domestic institutions started considering how to update existing regulation in order to face these complex and far-reaching challenges. This article assesses the effects of AI application on the employment relationship, with a view to understanding how social and legal institutions act, react or adapt to a potential experience of unprecedented digital surveillance in the workplace, entrenching command-and-control relationships between management and workers.

The paper is organized as follows. After describing the new arenas of workplace surveillance, we provide a comprehensive conceptualization of AI application. Section 2 explores the latest generation of digital devices, understood in their broadest definition encompassing both physical supports as well as intangible tools. In many cases, AI prevents accidents caused by human error or reduce the hazard (or even the burden) of routine and menial activities. On the other hand, these software and devices create an effective, invasive and elusive system of watchfulness increasing conformity and promoting docility.

Section 3 describes how the EU has set the tone globally in the regulation of privacy and data protection. In particular, we scrutinize the new GDPR thoroughly. One concern on its effectiveness revolves around the limits on the automated decision-making processes (Art. 22). Section 4 describes how some European civil law systems deal with the regulation of surveillance of workers. The cases of France, Germany and Italy are analyzed by stressing the common elements and loopholes. Section 5 assesses some conclusions by verifying whether the current regulations are suitable to cope with the adoption of AI at work.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'watching', 'work.', 'digital', 'surveillance,', 'employee', 'monitoring,', 'regulatory', 'issues', 'context']"

AI and the metaverse in the workplace: DEI opportunities and challenges,2024,"Purpose The metaverse, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems and capabilities, allows considerable data analysis in the workplace, largely exceeding traditional people analytics data collection. While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a “balanced” approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations.","['metaverse', 'workplace:', 'opportunities', 'challenges']"
The Rise of Scientific Management,2023,"The information revolution has ushered in a data-driven reorganization of the workplace. Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) are used to surveil workers and shift risk. Workplace wellness programs appraise our health. Personality job tests calibrate our mental state. The monitoring of social media and the surveillance of the workplace measure our social behavior. With rich historical sources and contemporary examples, The Quantified Worker explores how the workforce science of today goes far beyond increasing efficiency and threatens to erase individual personhood. With exhaustive detail, Ifeoma Ajunwa shows how different forms of worker quantification are enabled, facilitated, and driven by technological advances. Timely and eye-opening, The Quantified Worker advocates for changes in the law that will mitigate the ill effects of the modern workplace.","['rise', 'scientific', 'management']"
Governing the work-related risks of AI: implications for the German government and trade unions,2023,"This article discusses the risks that artificial intelligence (AI) poses for work. It classifies risks into two types, direct and indirect. Direct risks are AI-induced forms of discrimination, surveillance and information asymmetries at work. Indirect risks are enhanced workplace automation and the increasing ‘fissurisation’ of work. Direct and indirect risks are illustrated using the example of the transport and logistics sector. We discuss policy responses to both types of risk in the context of the German economy and argue that the policy solutions need to differ according to the type of risk. Direct risks can be addressed by European and national regulation against discrimination, surveillance and information asymmetries. As for indirect risks, the first step is to monitor the risks so as to gain an understanding of sector-specific transformations and establish relevant expertise and competence. This way of addressing AI-induced risks at work will help to improve the prospects of decent work, fair remuneration and adequate social protection for all.","['governing', 'work-related', 'risks', 'implications', 'german', 'government', 'trade', 'unions']"
"The Gender Panopticon: Artificial Intelligence, Gender, and Design Justice",2021,"Using recent research from data scientists and technologists, this article argues that we are at a contradictory moment in history regarding the intersection of gender and technology, particularly as it affects LGBTQ+ communities. At the very same moment that we see the law embracing more and more visibility regarding gender identities and fluidity, we also see an even greater reliance on surveillance technologies that are flatly incapable of working beyond the binary of male and female. These technological limitations become even more fraught in today's age, where we face an unprecedented degree of surveillance – gender-related, and otherwise--than we have ever seen in history. When a binary system of gender merges with the binary nature of code, the result fails to integrate LGBTQ communities, particularly nonbinary and transgender populations, erasing them from view.Using insights from a wide range of studies on artificial intelligence technologies – automated body scanners, facial recognition, and content filtering on social media, we argue in this Article, that we need to grapple with the reality that the relationship between technology and gender is far more complicated than the law currently suggests. Technology companies, along with multiple courts, colleges, and workplaces, must realize that the binary presumptions of male and female identity are largely outdated for some, and often fail to capture the contemporary complexity of gender identity formation. The question for legal scholars and legislatures is how the law – and technology -- can and should respond to this complexity. In the final sections, we discuss some of the legal implications of these technologies of surveillance, looking at both law and the design of technology, and turn to some of the normative possibilities to develop greater equality and gender self-determination.","['gender', 'panopticon:', 'artificial', 'intelligence,', 'gender,', 'design', 'justice']"
"Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence",2022,"Atlas of AI is a book that strikes profound chords in the reader. It is both a well-researched example from the artificial intelligence field and an instructional guide on how to think “smartly” about the subject. Kate Crawford’s adroit use of a geographical planetary map of technoindustrial wastelands situates and problematizes the Big Tech boom. She starts with San Francisco, where gold mining in the nineteenth century created a rush of robber barons and a boom era of “extraction” that coincides with the excessive milking of everyone’s data from our current interface, the technological “device.” Throughout Crawford’s text, techno-mechanisms that claim a heroic stature are viewed as near exploitation of an underclass of “users,” and AI’s seamless efficiency is seen as a heavily privatized, if not secreted, backdrop of unseen power, first, in her brief visit to a once-lush living lake sucked dry by the lust for lithium, a rare earth material required by Tesla to make car batteries, or the use of third-world countries as sources of other rare earth material increasingly in demand by tech companies (p. 16). She discusses not only lithium but coal and oil, with the true costs of extraction taking their toll on Malaysian rubber trees and leaving toxic residues in Inner Mongolia. These histories of destruction that energy and trade corporations have wreaked upon many environments are framed within a context of direct blame upon the fairy-tale of endless “economic growth”—arguably, a position on environmentalism, industry and populations who are not benefiting and may certainly be harmed by climate crisis and poverty. The book is laid out as a research journey beginning in the heart of the western U.S. desert and extending to industrial history in Britain and the ideas of Charles Babbage; to the scientific management practices of Frederick W. Taylor and Henry Ford; to the archives of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Google’s TrueTime project, an effort to control all time by individual quantification. Each chapter is a powerful component in an integrated and informative argument about the unseen effects of AI upon people and the shared planet. Crawford indicts the “fourth industrial revolution” from its inside out, undermining re-virtualization via commercial spin around the technology’s “value and benefits”—a first-world problem. Instead, her concerns speak for the invisible spaces, peoples, and cultures that are inadvertently destroyed in the path of first-world industrial and consumer society. Chapters are in depth: Earth, Labor, Data, Classification, Affect, State, Power and Space. Going all the way back to Charles Babbage, moments in technological “development” are likened to the current interest in AI for their similar appeals toward automation, the streamlining of workplaces and the building of efficiency systems within a regime of social control of human labor. From this perspective, she points to one of the most significant features of AI, “the labor content of the finished product” that is rendered “largely invisible” by the process as a whole. From this critique of human-versus-machine inter-communication upon which AI production rests, Crawford lays out an incisive groundwork for problematizing the role of the technology and its presentation to culture. Citing Astra Taylor’s commentary, “the kind of efficiency to which techno-evangelists aspire emphasizes standardization, simplification, and speed, not diversity, complexity, and interdependence” (p. 71), Crawford writes, “We are living the result of a system [capitalism] in which companies must extract as much value as possible.” These views take us to a detailed section on Google’s TrueTime, the “process of time coordination at the heart of workplace management,” which involves a controlling of bodies. This critique of workplace management is deftly combined with the critique of “extraction” through the lens of data harvesting. The enormous datasets upon which AI has until recently rested, which were developed by computer scientists in research capacities, are “full of people selfies, of hand gestures, of people driving cars, of babies crying, of newsgroup conversations from the 1990s.” All of these images and bits of data—where anything can be a piece of data—amount to free material ripped off from “users” to improve the performance of algorithms and their functions in “facial recognition, language prediction, and object detection.” She notes that once these datasets become baked into the AI databases, the image itself is rendered meaningless. Gigantic collections of criminal faces without name or identity are being used in this way for facial recognition of “active” criminals. No backdoor analysis of AI systems would be complete without discussion of the military past and present of AI having shaped practices of surveillance. Deep connections between the tech sector and military cybersecurity abound, but not necessarily in terms of entire computational and analytical systems. Once a novelty of widespread telecommunications broadcast power, the satellites are now nodes in developed webs coating and controlling the globe, whether for “mapping,” spying or transmission. The satellite world of GPS, coupled with huge requirements for “security,” and prediction software are being widely developed to comprehend the possibility in every act—from missile launches to local crime to shopping desires. “Contemporary systems use labels to predict human identity, commonly using binary genes, essentialized racial categories, and problematic assessments of character and credit worthiness.” Facial expressions read by AI can reveal a person’s inner emotional state, according to psychologist Paul Eckman, whose model of universal emotional states “read directly from the face” is being utilized by tech companies in “affect recognition systems” as part of an “industry predicted to be worth more than seventeen billion dollars.” Crawford then takes on Eckman and his premise. Thus, we arrive at what we have suspected all along: Current AI systems are more a tool of state power than anything else. The long arm of capital has reached once again into our personal lives, each of us like soft-flesh data controlled in a kind of nightmarish future where morsels of human-produced data (from living our lives) is fed continuously into a “diverse” and “widespread” apparatus just as spectacular in its “capability” to render the entire mirror world and its matrix as ever before. Presenting capital and military collusion in the context of a strong “nationalistic” agenda, Crawford goes back to the city of San Francisco as a hub for gold extraction, now a central location of Big Tech companies—Facebook, Twitter, Google, Salesforce—where the dystopia of “work management” and “government control” is all too obvious. Military systems are now the working apparatus of municipal governments, she argues, further blurring lines between states and subjects. As overlapping sectors share the same goals of national interest, AI systems widen existing asymmetries of power. As long as AI remains the “new” tool of the military-corporate-industrial complex, one that protects capital and property while it demands exploitation of the third world, there is little hope for social change. The technology is too pervasive; too fast; and too privatized. Yet Crawford politely leaves the reader with a positive note. She believes that as conditions on Earth change, presumably for the worse due to climate change and worker exploitation by Big Data capital, “calls for data protection, labor rights, climate justice and racial equity” will be heard and heard together. They will become more organized and more overlapped; the mush of disfigured non-shapes that AI once roughly created as “art” will now rise up to assume their most powerful figures yet, and the system will change. A good read and a musthave on the shelf of anyone interested in AI, labor and the environment, the most important crisis of our day.","['atlas', 'power,', 'politics,', 'planetary', 'costs', 'artificial', 'intelligence']"
Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights at Work,2023,"While debates surrounding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the ‘future of work’ have largely focused on automation of production processes and job destruction, it is increasingly clear that it is the use of AI to manage and govern the workplace that presents the more immediate challenge. This chapter argues that employers’ use of AI in algorithmic management and workplace surveillance technologies poses a significant and pervasive threat to human rights at work, one that is not confined to the rights of privacy and equality concerns that have so far dominated scholarly attention. The chapter sets out the ways in which technology is being used to undertake or augment managerial functions at all stages of the employment relationship and illustrates how these algorithmic management practices present a risk to a wide range of workers’ human rights. In addition to privacy and non-discrimination rights, this includes freedom of association and expression, due process rights, and the right to decent working conditions. The chapter then argues that ex ante forms of regulation are necessary to address the risk that AI poses to human rights at work and identifies and assesses two such frameworks that can be used to help secure human rights in this context, namely human rights impact assessments and collective bargaining over the use of technology in the workplace.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'human', 'rights', 'work']"
‘Master and Servers’: Collective Labour Rights and Private Government in the Contemporary World of Work,2020,"This paper explores the issues of subordination and authority in the contemporary world of work as they are exacerbated by new forms of work-surveillance that track emotions and mental states of workers by means of artificial intelligence, predictive algorithms and big data. It discusses subordination and submission in the contemporary work arrangements, against by highlighting how new technologies and business practices expand hierarchy and forms of private government beyond the scope of the employment relationship. It explores some of the technologies and practices that magnify and expand managerial powers to unprecedented levels, by tracking and strictly monitoring workers’ emotional and mental states. It also highlights how collective labour rights represent the best counterbalance to restrain these practices and curbing modern forms of private government in the workplace. It concludes by discussing how the distinction between the traditional functions of collective rights, the ‘civil liberty’ function and the ‘industrial’ one is increasingly blurred and arguing that an expansion of the personal scope of collective rights is crucial in this regard.","['‘master', 'servers’:', 'collective', 'labour', 'rights', 'private', 'government', 'contemporary', 'world', 'work']"
My Boss the Computer: A Bayesian analysis of socio-demographic and cross-cultural determinants of attitude toward the Non-Human Resource Management,2021,"Human resource management technologies have moved from biometric surveillance to emotional artificial intelligence (AI) that monitor employees’ engagement and productivity, analyze video interviews and CVs of job applicants. The rise of the US$20 billion emotional AI industry will transform the future workplace. Yet, besides no international consensus on the principles or standards for such technologies, there is a lack of cross-cultural research on future job seekers’ attitude toward such use of AI technologies. This study collects a cross-sectional dataset of 1,015 survey responses of international students from 48 countries and 8 regions worldwide. A majority of the respondents (52%) are concerned about being managed by AI. Following the hypothetico-deductivist philosophy of science, we use the MCMC Hamiltonian approach and conduct a detailed comparison of 10 Bayesian network models with the PSIS-LOO method. We consistently find having a higher income, being male, majoring in business, and/or self-rated familiarity with AI correlate with a more positive view of emotional AI in the workplace. There is also a stark cross-cultural and cross-regional difference. Our analysis shows people from economically less developed regions (Africa, Oceania, Central Asia) tend to exhibit less concern for AI managers. And for East Asian countries, 64% of the Japanese, 56% of the South Korean, and 42% of the Chinese professed the trusting attitude. In contrast, an overwhelming majority of 75% of the European and Northern American possesses the worrying/neutral attitude toward being managed by AI. Regarding religion, Muslim students correlate with the most concern toward emotional AI in the workplace (β_Islam_Attitude’s mean =-0.16, sd =0.10; β_Buddhism_Attitude’s mean =-0.05, sd =0.07; β_Christian_Attitude ‘s mean = -0.10, sd= 0.09). When religiosity is higher, the correlation becomes stronger for Muslim and Buddhist students. This paper adds a cross-cultural perspective to the literature, which is currently skewed toward country-specific and profession-specific samples.","['boss', 'computer:', 'bayesian', 'analysis', 'socio-demographic', 'cross-cultural', 'determinants', 'attitude', 'toward', 'non-human', 'resource', 'management']"

"Biosupremacy: Big Data, Antitrust, and Monopolistic Power Over Human Behavior",2020,"Since 2001, five leading technology companies have acquired more than 600 other firms while avoiding antitrust enforcement. By accumulating technologies in adjacent or unrelated industries, these companies have grown so powerful that their influence over human affairs equals that of many governments. Their power stems from data collected by devices that people welcome into their homes, workplaces, schools, and public spaces. When paired with artificial intelligence, these devices form a vast surveillance network that sorts people into increasingly specific categories related to health, sexuality, religion, and other categories. However, this surveillance network was not created solely to observe human behavior; it was also designed to exert control. Accordingly, it is paired with a second network that leverages intelligence gained through surveillance to manipulate people's behavior, nudging them through personalized newsfeeds, targeted advertisements, dark patterns, and other forms of coercive choice architecture. Together, these dual networks of surveillance and control form a global digital panopticon, a modern analog of Bentham's eighteenth-century building designed for total surveillance. Moreover, they enable a pernicious type of influence that Foucault defined as biopower: the ability to measure and modify the behavior of populations to shift social norms. 

This Article is the first to introduce biopower into antitrust doctrine. It contends that a handful of companies are vying for a dominant share of biopower to achieve biosupremacy, monopolistic power over human behavior. The Article analyzes how companies concentrate biopower through unregulated conglomerate and concentric mergers that add software and devices to their surveillance and control networks. Acquiring technologies in new markets establishes cross-market data flows that send information to acquiring firms across market boundaries. Conglomerate and concentric mergers also expand the control network, establishing beachheads from which platforms exert biopower to shift social norms. 

Antitrust regulators should expand their conception of consumer welfare to account for the costs imposed by surveillance and coercive choice architecture on product quality. They should revive conglomerate merger control, abandoned in the 1970s, and update it for the Digital Age. Specifically, regulators should halt mergers that concentrate biopower, prohibit the use of dark patterns, and mandate data silos, which contain data within specific markets, to block cross-market data flows. To prevent technology companies from locking consumers into proprietary platforms that concentrate biopower, regulators should force companies to implement data portability and platform interoperability.","['biosupremacy:', 'data,', 'antitrust,', 'monopolistic', 'power', 'over', 'human', 'behavior']"
Employee Surveillance Using Algorithmic Management Based on Artificial Intelligence Systems,2025,"The article analyses the legal regulation of employee surveillance managed by employers carried on algorithmic management based on artificial intelligence systems. Employers observe employees and their work so that to smoothly organize work processes at workplaces, ensure efficient use of resources, and manage risks. Through the process of surveillance, personal data of employees are collected, which are later analysed; hence, employees may experience direct legal consequences (for example, termination of employment, violations of work duties, adjusted wages, etc.). Algorithmic management based on artificial intelligence systems generates various risks to employees. Before starting their application, employers have to evaluate various requirements. The key requirements arise from the Artificial Intelligence Act, the General Data Protection Regulation and the practice formed by the European Court of Human Rights which has been established regarding employee surveillance. Also, the employer has the obligation to ensure the employee’s privacy rights, since, when applying algorithmic management, artificial intelligence systems can sometimes make hardly predictable insights and reveal extremely sensitive facts about the employee. The issue of informing and consulting employees and their representatives regarding the implementation and use of algorithmic management based on artificial intelligence systems in the work environment is analysed.","['employee', 'surveillance', 'algorithmic', 'management', 'based', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'systems']"
The Invisible Web at Work: Artificial Intelligence and Electronic Surveillance in the Workplace,2020,"Employers and others who hire or engage workers to perform services use a dizzying array of electronic mechanisms to make personnel decisions about hiring, worker evaluation, compensation, discipline, and retention. These electronic mechanisms include electronic trackers, surveillance cameras, metabolism monitors, wearable biological measuring devices, and implantable technology. These tools enable employers to record their workers’ every movement, listen in on their conversations, measure minute aspects of performance, and detect oppositional organizing activities. The data collected is transformed by means of artificial intelligence (A-I) algorithms into a permanent electronic resume that can identify and predict an individual’s performance as well as their work ethic, personality, union proclivity, employer loyalty, and future health care costs. The electronic resume produced by A-I will accompany workers from job to job as they move around the boundaryless workplace. Thus A-I and electronic monitoring produce an invisible electronic web that threatens to invade worker privacy, deter unionization, enable subtle forms of employer blackballing, exacerbate employment discrimination, render unions ineffective, and obliterate the protections of the labor laws.

This article describes the many ways A-I is being used in the workplace and how its use is transforming the practices of hiring, evaluating, compensating, controlling, and dismissing workers. It then focuses on four areas of law in which A-I threatens to undermine worker protections: anti-discrimination law, privacy law, antitrust law, and labor law. Finally, this article maps out an agenda for future law reform and research.","['invisible', 'work:', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'electronic', 'surveillance', 'workplace']"
Contested Transparency: Digital Monitoring Technologies and Worker Voice,2023,"Advances in artificial intelligence and data analytics have notably expanded employers' monitoring and surveillance capabilities, facilitating the accurate observability of work effort. There is an ongoing debate among academics and policymakers about the productivity and broader welfare implications of digital monitoring (DM) technologies. In this context, many countries confer information, consultation and codetermination rights to employee representation (ER) bodies on matters related to the workplace governance of these technologies. Using a cross-sectional sample of more than 21000 European establishments, we document a positive association between ER and the utilization of DM technologies. We also find a positive effect of ER on DM utilization in the context of a local-randomization regression discontinuity analysis that exploits size-contingent policy rules governing the operation of ER bodies in Europe. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we find a positive association between DM and process innovations, particularly in establishments where ER bodies are present and a large fraction of workers perform jobs that require finding solutions to unfamiliar problems. We interpret these findings through the lens of a labor discipline model in which the presence of ER bodies affect employer's decision to invest in DM technologies.","['contested', 'transparency:', 'digital', 'monitoring', 'technologies', 'worker', 'voice']"

In addition to machine learning, ambient intelligence also uses knowledge graph–based technologies.5de Vargas M.F. Pereira C.E. Ontological User Modeling for Ambient Assisted Living Service Personalization. Springer, 2017Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar Ambient sensing exists as the result of the use of various ambient sensors, such as video cameras, depth, thermal, radio, acoustic, and wearable sensors (eg, in smart watch). The perception data from the ambient sensors, when integrated with various AI solutions, can help to design early warning systems to prevent adverse safety events, improve and support decision making, provide clinical workflow and operational efficiencies, and relieve administrative burden for physicians. Ambient AI applications in health care delivery, as shown in Figure 2, can be leveraged at various touch points, such as outpatient clinics, hospital, and patient's home/daily living space to augment health care delivery, by benefiting patients and their direct care providers/family members, clinical care providers, and enterprises. Ambient clinical intelligence: This is a conversational AI application that integrates ambient voice sensing technology and virtual assistant function, to automate and streamline the visit documentation into the electronic health record (EHR), and data retrieval from the EHR by a physician, during a patient's clinic encounter.6Nahar J.K.

The touchless voice activated virtual assistant helps to decrease the administrative burden of physicians, enables better physician-patient interaction, and improves patient satisfaction and experience. Ambient AI technology is being used in health care to create virtual nurse assistants that can provide personalized care to patients. These virtual assistants can be integrated into patients' homes, hospitals, and clinics, providing real-time assistance to patients, monitoring their health status, and communicating with health care providers. For example, in a hospital setting, virtual nurse assistants can monitor patients' vital signs and alert the health care providers if there are any changes in their condition. They can also provide patients with information about their medications, assist with scheduling appointments, and even remind patients to take their medication. In a home setting, virtual nurse assistants can provide patients with reminders to take their medication and follow their treatment plans. They can also monitor patients' health status and alert the health care providers if there are any concerning changes. One example of a virtual nurse assistant is Sensely's ""Molly,"" a conversational AI platform that provides patients with personalized health coaching and care management. Patients can interact with Molly through a smartphone application or a smart speaker, and the platform uses natural language processing to understand patients' needs and provide personalized support. There are various benefits of ambient AI–enabled virtual assistants. The virtual nursing assistants can lower health care costs by reducing the need of in-person nursing staff visits and preventing hospital readmissions by timely triage and enabling care coordination with the physicians.7Lee D.

There are two important hospital spaces where ambient AI has great utility. These spaces are intensive care or critical care unit (ICU) and operating rooms. i.First is to prevent data fatigue and augment the workflow of clinicians. Mayo clinic built an EHR interface for clinicians in the ICU called Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation. This ambient intelligence–based application enabled filtering of meaningful data from the vast volume of data entering into the EHR, delivering real-time context specific, high value clinical information to the physicians, augmenting timely clinical decision support, and preventing data overload.9Herasevich V.

As we look forward to designing, developing, and scaling ambient AI applications in health care delivery, the following challenges need to be considered and optimally addressed as applicable to the use case, keeping human-centered AI, and multistakeholder perspectives in mind. Various ambient sensors may capture a large volume and variety of personal/private data, which the patient may not be comfortable in sharing. There is risk of inappropriate sharing of data without the patient's knowledge and use of data beyond its original intended use or by third parties without informed consent.

Ethical and Legal Concerns of Artificial Intelligence in the Workplace: Examining Current Legislations in the United States,2023,"Abstract. The emergence of remote work prompted by the global Covid-19 pandemic has transformed workplace dynamics, highlighting intricate concerns about employee privacy and autonomy. However, the rise of algorithmic management driven by artificial intelligence (AI) challenges the assumed privacy in remote work settings. This paper examines the ethical and legal landscape of AI-powered employee monitoring in the United States. It employs a mixed-methods approach, incorporating literature review, case analysis, legal examination, and ethical analysis. Past cases reveal the complex interaction between personal privacy and employer surveillance, offering insights for current and future legal actions. Current legislation, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), is explored, along with state-specific laws and their implications. Ethical concerns encompass biometric data tracking, discriminatory biases, and gig economy surveillance. AI’s impact on employee behavior and future implications are discussed, suggesting the need for balanced policies that prioritize transparency, fairness, accountability, and trust. In navigating the challenges of AI-powered monitoring, organizations should consider ethical considerations, existing legislation, and future trends to create a harmonious work environment that respects individual rights.&#x0D; Abstrak.

An Evaluation of the Technologies Used for the Real-Time Monitoring of the Risk of Falling from Height in Construction—Systematic Review,2024,"The construction industry has the highest number of fatal accidents compared to other industries. However, manual safety compliance monitoring is complex and difficult for safety engineers, and more automated solutions need to be found. The main research objective was to review the state of the art of real-time monitoring technologies used to assess the risk of falling from height in the construction sector. A systematic review is proposed in order to summarise the technologies used for real-time monitoring in the construction sector, following the PRISMA methodology. Only studies that assessed the risk of falling in real time were selected. From an initial set of 1289 articles, 40 were classified as strictly relevant to addressing the research questions. Various technologies that use artificial intelligence have been designed to monitor workers in real time and to send alerts to workers at any time in the event of a risk situation, thus preventing accidents. This study showed that new technologies are being introduced to predict the risk of a fall in real time, changing the approach from reactive to proactive and allowing this monitoring to improve workplace surveillance and safety. Further research is needed to develop effective systems that are easy for people to use without compromising productivity.","['evaluation', 'technologies', 'used', 'real-time', 'monitoring', 'risk', 'falling', 'height', 'construction—systematic', 'review']"
The Future of Work is Ours,2018,"Unifor recently held a one-day conference on Automation, New Technology and the Future of Work. As part of this event, the union released a discussion paper called The Future of Work is Ours: Confronting risks and seizing opportunities of technological change. With 315,000 members across the country in almost every sector of the economy, Unifor is Canada’s largest private-sector union. The union’s response to technological change is very much a work in progress, and the conference and discussion paper serve as a starting point in this process. The fundamental question at hand: how do we develop a worker-led program allowing us to get the best of technological change while avoiding the worst? We know that working people in Canada and around the world have been experiencing the negative impacts of technological change, and are feeling threatened and afraid for their own futures. At the same time, we have seen incredible opportunities for new and better jobs, union growth, and advancements in workplace health and safety due to technological change. Our responsibility as workers and as a union is to take control of this conversation and move from a position of fear and defence to a position of power and action. Making the transition means first understanding the problem, and a portion of our discussion paper and day-long conference focused on deepening our understanding of exactly what we’re talking about when we discuss technological change at work. Of course, our members know that technological change is nothing new. We have always experienced the effects of technological change, from the invention of the printing press, to the Industrial Revolution, to the invention of the modern computer. But what is new is the speed of that change. In just a generation, we’ve seen the invention of the internet and artificial intelligence, so-called ‘big data’ and the advent of mass surveillance, and the widespread use of advanced robotics and other automation. A flurry of negative headlines have made wild claims about the coming ‘robot apocalypse’, where millions of jobs would be replaced by automation. However, more recently we have seen a more nuanced analysis emerge. This revised analysis focuses on the difference between a task and a job. A task is a discrete segment of work done as part of a worker’s duties of employment, while a job is a bundle of tasks assigned to a worker who performs those tasks and exchanges their labour for pay. A recent report from McKinsey Global Institute estimates that fewer than 5 percent of existing occupations are candidates for full automation. Frequently, rather than completely eliminating jobs, automation and artificial intelligence will replace some tasks, requiring workers to adjust their level of skills and knowledge used in the workplace. In terms of the Canadian context, four separate think tanks estimated the share of tasks susceptible to automation in Canada as ranging between 35 percent and 47 percent. This is across all sectors of our economy. Understanding the Impacts Part of the challenge we identified was how to create an analysis that allows our members to engage in a meaningful way. We created a framework that identifies six general areas of impact – both positive and negative – to make this issue more digestible. The first, and probably most obvious, impact is job loss or displacement, and job estrangement. Job loss or displacement is what most of us think of when we consider tech change at work – ‘I was fired from work and replaced by a robot’. But as we’ve seen, the situation is more complex, and often less dire, than that. Less obvious is what we’ve called job estrangement, where a worker’s role in her workplace changes due to technological change, leaving her feeling alienated from her work, where her skill and knowledge are no longer valued. The second major category of impact is changes in work organisation and required skills. These are impacts that many of us have experienced already. We’ve probably all heard about, and perhaps even participated in ‘up-skilling’, when workers displaced by technological change upgrade their skills to fill new roles that complement and support new technologies. But the...","['future', 'work', 'ours']"
Why Violence Against Doctors? What to Do?,2023,"The recent untoward incident involving the death of a junior doctor at the hands of a felon brought for routine examination in Kerala, India, had made the entire medical fraternity rise in arms. There were nationwide protests held by junior doctors for a while, debates on popular television channels regarding the vulnerability of the medical staff at the hands of patients and their relatives, condolence messages, and support posts on social media with hashtags galore—#doctormurdered, #savelives, #justicefordoctors, and so forth. Now once all the hue and cry has died down, what has really changed? How are we protecting our doctors and nurses from such attacks in the future? Who is responsible for the safety of those who have vowed to dedicate their lives to saving fellow human beings? This incident is certainly not an isolated case in India. While there have been sporadic cases of violence across the country, the trend has steadily been rising.[1,2] What constitutes workplace violence? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Guideline set in 2002—""Workplace violence is defined as the situations where staffs are ill-treated, intimidated or attacked in conditions linked to their workplace, including commuting to and from the workplace, involving an explicit or implicit challenge to their safety, well-being or health.""[3] While this definition captures the physical and verbal abuse meted out to healthcare staff at the workplace, it does not talk about the newer forms of psychological attacks that one can unleash by just the click of a button. A bad rating or an unsavory comment about the services of a doctor on social media can tarnish the image and question the competence of any established doctor, even affecting his sanity. In the present times, workplace violence should therefore be simply defined as ""A situation where staff are attacked, abused or ill-treated either physically, virtually, verbally, psychologically or financially resulting in an immediate threat to their safety, well-being or health."" WHY IS THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE INCREASING TOWARD DOCTORS? Gone are the days when doctors were revered next to God and held in high regard in society. In present times, a doctor is just like any other service provider. Workplace violence has now become an inevitable part of health care globally.[4,5] The annual incidence of violence is four times higher for healthcare worker when compared to any other profession![6] In a recent study published by the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, an alarming 75% of doctors reported having faced some form of violence either physical or verbal at the workplace.[7] The healthcare system in India is inching toward unregulated commercialization and privatization and with it come the perils of rising healthcare costs and therefore an ever-rising expectation from the paying public that all illnesses must be cured. Slowly but surely respect has dwindled and has been replaced with disdain and distrust from the public. While the reasons for this mindset shift are aplenty, here are a notable few: Rising cost of health care. A single visit to the hospital ends up costing more than the daily wage earned by many people. Added to the registration and consultation fees is the cost of investigations and medications. A patient surely returns home lighter in the purse and not completely disease-free. In this scenario, there is a high expectation from the patients and their relatives to get back their ""money's worth."" When this expectation is not met, the situation can quickly escalate into violence. Overwhelmed staff. Outpatient departments of any reputed hospital or medical college during peak hours are bustling like the marketplace with heavy footfall. There is just not enough staff to cater to the ever-increasing crowd of patients. India has just about achieved the WHO-recommended doctor–patient ratio of 1:1000 if we include both allopathic and ayurvedic doctors.[8] In this context, it becomes impossible to please every patient who walks in through the door. The doctor–patient interaction is now limited to a few high-impact questions about the history, a slew of investigations, and a prompt prescription hoping for quick patient disposal. The gentle art of rapport building and history taking that the erstwhile general practitioner (GP) employed is now long forgotten in the buzz of early morning OPDs extending well into the evenings. Gaps in communication. Treatment outcomes are greatly influenced by effective doctor–patient communication; however, several studies conducted across India have shown that this skill is slowly declining.[9,10] Many patients complain about the attitude of unfriendly and rude staff, lack of transparency in the treatment process, difficulty in understanding complex medical terms, and lack of empathy from staff who are ill-equipped to allay the fears and anxiety of patients. This could be a fallout of the excessive patient load and severe time crunch as mentioned above or the poor soft skills of the hospital staff. Whatever the case be, these lacunae in communication are one of the prime reasons why an unsatisfied patient is increasingly resorting to violence toward the healthcare staff. Lack of infrastructure and inconsistent referral systems. Many of our government hospitals function with inadequate infrastructure and staff. Unavailability of basic life-saving medications, congested ward rooms, oxygen shortage, and absent healthcare staff are something of daily occurrence in the public healthcare sector. The confusion regarding where to refer an emergency case leads to critical wastage of time. This is why we often hear about irate patients' relatives complaining of gross negligence and complacency and sudden mob violence erupting in emergency situations. Misinformation via social media. In current times, social media has replaced the doctor as the primary source of health-related information. Patients are now resorting to solutions from Google and other search engines instead of visiting their healthcare provider. Often, information available on social media platforms turns out to be exaggerated and unrealistic. This misinformation leads to a culture of mistrust and suspicion where every investigation and prescription are considered unnecessary and viewed as one performed only to benefit the doctor financially. CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASING VIOLENCE TOWARD HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS Apart from disruption of routine medical services and physical injury or death being an obvious consequence, there is also the underlying psychosocial distress that the doctor must endure. In a study conducted across India,[11] feelings of shame, loss of self-esteem, stress, depression, and anxiety were among the top mental health concerns faced by doctors following an act of workplace violence. Such negative emotions can in turn affect the very psyche and moral of the treating physician forcing him or her to change their work location or even leave the country in search of a more stable and safe work environment. This will further compound the shortage of healthcare staff and propagate the vicious cycle of violence even more. Additionally, doctors will practice a more defensive mode of treatment necessitating more investigations further increasing the cost of care. MEASURES TO REDUCE THE MENACE OF VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS The time has come when these reports of violence and abuse against healthcare providers can no longer be brushed under the carpet as isolated incidents. The trend is alarming, and concrete steps need to be taken to tackle this issue. A multifaceted approach is warranted, and the provision of a supportive workplace should be at its forefront. Investing in quality health care. The Indian investment in health care is still lower than 1.5% of the GDP and well below the National Health Policy, 2017, recommendation of 2.5%.[12] We cannot create wonders when the existing system is bursting at its seams. Strengthening the primary healthcare system, establishment and optimal functioning of primary health centers and subentries in the villages can help ease patient load in district- and tertiary-level hospitals. Recruitment of vacant posts at all remote hospitals with the provision of basic laboratory facilities and well-stocked medications can strengthen the roots of India's healthcare system. Legal safeguards. The Indian Medical Association has been advocating for a dedicated central law to protect the interests of healthcare personnel for several decades now. During the pandemic, in 2020, we had the ""The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance."" The amendment created a provision to levy those convicted of harassing or assaulting a healthcare worker a fine of Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 lakhs and be imprisoned for three months to five years. In case the injury (inflicted on the worker) was serious, the convicted person would have to pay a higher fine and/or spend more time in prison. After the massive outrage following the recent stabbing and subsequent demise of the young doctor, the state of Kerala has approved new legislation to provide stronger protection for doctors and healthcare workers. Under the ordinance, anyone found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to any healthcare worker or professional would be punished with imprisonment ranging from one year to seven years and a fine between Rs. one lakh to Rs. 5 lakh would be imposed upon them. The ordinance also provides that anyone who commits or attempts to commit or incites or inspires an act of violence against healthcare workers or those working in healthcare institutions shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than 6 months and up to 5 years and with a fine between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 2 lakhs. This provision extends not only to doctors and nurses but also to paramedical students, security guards, ambulance drivers, and managerial staff working in hospitals.[13] Patient education and awareness. Emphasis should be on educating patients regarding the pitfalls of blindly following online medical information and the limitations of any modern treatment or treating doctor. No surgery is 100% safe, no medication is without side effects, and no doctor can promise a complete cure. Keeping realistic expectations can help open channels of communication and benefit the patient in the long run. Soft skill training for healthcare professionals. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers should be taught about the nuances of effective communication. There is a need to be trained, in addition to a variety of skills, about how to communicate with the patient at every stage of their treatment process, cultivate the art of active listening, learn how to break bad news, and show empathy toward their needs. The current undergraduate curriculum has taken a step in the right direction with the inclusion of Attitude, Ethics and Communication (AETCOM) classes in the CBME curriculum. Such soft skills training is also required for the senior staff who may propagate this cycle of abuse via their authoritarian leadership style. Strengthening surveillance and security measures at hospitals. Creating a database of violence experienced by healthcare staff can help us understand the magnitude of the problem. Stricter protocols when dealing with criminals, alcoholics, and drug abusers and increased security measures especially for doctors tending to emergencies or ICUs and those working night shifts will deter most miscreants. Greater focus on the mental health of healthcare providers. Counseling sessions, group therapies, and paid vacations are some of the measures adopted by our Western counterparts to address the issue of physician exhaustion and burnout. A mentally exhausted doctor with no sleep and constant stress is bound to make more mistakes. Better staffing patterns, fewer night duties, reasonable working hours, reduced administrative tasks, and computerization of documentation along with supportive management can work wonders. Automation of healthcare tasks. Technology and artificial intelligence can be used to ease the bottlenecks and delays faced at the hospital. Clever queue management systems, faster delivery of medications, investigation reports, and discharge summaries can make visiting the hospital a much more pleasant experience for the patient. In conclusion, the road ahead seems quite daunting, but the solutions are right here. The need of the hour is to provide a safe and welcoming environment for the healthcare provider to do what she or he is best suited to do—to heal and to comfort!","['violence', 'against', 'doctors?', 'what']"
"The B Reader Program, Silicosis, and Physician Workload Management",2021,"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold considerable potential as healthcare tools. Their pattern recognition features, in conjunction with their speed and increasingly high-fidelity analysis, promise to redefine conventional diagnostic paradigms. These characteristics readily lend themselves to labor-intensive pulmonary imaging; a number of AI products have already received FDA clearance for this purpose and are currently marketed in the United States.1 These new technologies may find particular application filling an old regulatory compliance need – the B Reader Program. Administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for over half a century, the B Reader Program is tasked with monitoring pneumoconiosis among exposed industrial workers. However, it faces long-declining physician participation and a recently broadened mandate – two factors which may render compliance increasingly difficult. Moreover, a number of emerging reports have drawn attention to potential financial conflicts of interest (COI) which may bias independent B Readers toward overreporting positive findings, and employer-retained physicians toward underreporting them.2 Emerging AI technologies can offer a solution to both COI and supply-demand mismatch. Leveraging their innate machine learning capabilities to reduce physician workload, efficiently process large volumes of imaging data, and lower rates of human error, AI-enabled radiology tools may breathe new life into an ailing program. FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLICY Pneumoconiosis comprises a series of interstitial lung diseases which ultimately result in lung parenchymal fibrosis, often after protracted occupational or environmental exposure.3 At the cellular level, it is brought on by the chronic inhalation of airborne particulates, prompting alveolar macrophages to engulf foreign material and induce fibrosis.4 The resultant changes to lung architecture are progressive, irreversible, and dose-dependent. Over time, pneumoconiosis may produce a slew of downstream pathologies, including lung cancer, increased susceptibility to tuberculosis, and collagen vascular disease.5–8 Pneumoconiosis is generally classified according to the type of particulate matter implicated; chief among them are silicosis, asbestosis, and coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), also known as ""black lung disease.""9 To mitigate the untoward effects of CWP, Congress passed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act in 1969, which among other actions directed the Department of Health and Human Services (then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) to establish a routine screening radiography program for coal workers.10 The Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program, administered by NIOSH, was developed to this end. The NIOSH B Reader system finds its origins in this program, which aimed to identify, certify, and engage qualified physicians in a national CWP screening endeavor.11 As its name implies, ""B"" Readers were initially called upon to confirm suspected features of pneumoconiosis in a second-opinion capacity.12 The program today dispenses with the preceding ""A"" Readers and instead relies upon a cadre of highly trained B Readers to independently establish findings of CWP.13 Since 1976, the program has sought to minimize interobserver variability through a rigorous certification process, evaluating candidates on the basis of their ability to categorize images according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses.14 WINDS OF CHANGE In 2018, OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) issued new regulations aimed at protecting individuals at risk of silicosis, specifying that employers have a ""duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent and detect violations of the silica standard.""15 Just as NIOSH does with CWP, OSHA requires that at-risk individuals receive triennial chest X-rays interpreted specifically by a NIOSH-certified B Reader for screening and classification.16 This well-intentioned policy bears profound implications. An estimated 2.3 million workers face routine occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica, a figure dwarfing the some 50,000 employed in coal mining.17 Crystalline silica is far more pervasive than coal dust and is implicated across a range of industries, including building construction, maritime manufacture, glass production, mining, and agriculture.18 Having issued these new guidelines, OSHA vastly expanded the population subject to screening, just as the pool of B Readers has continued to diminish over the years. The mean physician age of qualified B Readers has soared into the sixties while pass rates on the certification exam have consistently deteriorated since at least the mid-1980s.19 From a peak of 750 in 1993, it has exhibited secular decline to its current level of 209 according to latest NIOSH statistics.20 The reasons for this decline remain to be determined. No dedicated studies interrogating the origins of this trend have been conducted, although some researchers have postulated that changing educational patterns, a broader move from plain radiography to CT imaging, and economic shifts within the affected industries are at least partly to blame.19 In addition, a recent study has documented endemic subjectivity among existing B Readers' reports, which in turn may be related to financial COI; those read by federally funded independent B Readers tended to overreport pneumoconiosis findings, while those interpreted by employer-hired physicians were more likely to underreport them.21 Twelve states altogether lack B Readers, including Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming.19 This is significant; unlike coal mining, the occupations implicating respirable crystalline silica exposure are not geographically concentrated. The totality of these trends would imply a potentially overwhelming burden upon current B Readers, who are mostly board-certified radiologists, pulmonologists, internal medicine, or occupational medicine physicians often engaged in full-time practice. Absent a change in federal screening guidelines, an increase in the number of qualified B Readers, or marked reduction in the occupational exposure to inhaled silica dust, this strain can only be expected to worsen over time. A TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED SOLUTION Enter AI-enabled radiology tools. These products may find myriad applications in screening for silicosis and other pneumoconioses, from workflow management and triaging to patent computer-aided detection (CADe).22 A number of existing FDA-cleared products offering each of these functions may be appropriate to the task. Perhaps more intriguingly, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese researchers have independently developed CADe algorithms specifically for pneumoconiosis detection and monitoring.23–25 Each applied deep learning techniques to chest X-rays to classify cases according to ILO criteria. These systems demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity to human physicians, while diminishing the high interobserver variability which has previously plagued the B Reader Program.26 This can moreover mitigate the effect of potential COI by offering a standardized readout across interpreting providers. Although the B Reader Program is currently limited to analysis of plain film radiography, ultra-low-dose CT may offer a more precise modality for pneumoconiosis surveillance. This would limit radiation exposure while retaining the benefits of high-resolution imaging, which facilitate application of CADe techniques.27 To this end, Fujifilm and Kyoto University have developed a CT-based AI tool for pneumoconiosis detection, which they are currently commercializing and plan to market in 2021.28 The federal government can further the domestic research, development, and early deployment of similar products. This can be accomplished through a pilot program, spearheaded by either by the Department of Labor (the parent organization of OSHA) or the CDC (which oversees NIOSH). This would not represent an unprecedented move for either. In particular, the CDC has been actively engaged in technology demonstration projects over a span of years, and NIOSH has operated the Center for Occupational Robotics Research (CORR) since 2017 to conduct feasibility studies on automation technologies' potential to reduce workplace injuries.29 Together with the National Science Foundation (NSF), CORR routinely provides grant funding to academic partners in support of related research.30 Entities seeking to develop AI-enhanced silicosis screening technologies could obtain funding via a joint CORR/NSF grant, and then engage with the NIOSH Future of Work Initiative, which explicitly names artificial intelligence applications among its key priorities.31 Through this avenue, NIOSH may endow promising technologies with the necessary support for further testing, early deployment, and eventual scaling. A prospective pilot program could bear two foci: (1) supporting existing FDA-cleared CADe products as they expand their approved indications to include pneumoconiosis and (2) furthering the development of novel platforms, such as those in the studies referenced above, for clinical use in the United States. Through either pathway, programs demonstrating high-fidelity pneumoconiosis detection can find integration within the B Reader Program itself. To be clear, these AI tools would not replace human B Readers. As with other CADe products, they would flag potentially concerning features to the interpreting physician, who remains the ultimate arbiter of clinical decision making. After suitable programs receive FDA clearance, NIOSH can amend its B Reader guidelines to consider use of AI tools to assist human physicians. It has updated its regulations to keep pace with changing technologies once before; in 2012, NIOSH moved to permit submission of digitally acquired X-rays, as opposed to film radiographs, and issued specifications to that effect.32 This much-needed update provides a template for future NIOSH regulatory sanction of AI tools in pneumoconiosis screening initiatives. NIOSH should moreover consider utilizing this avenue to extend the B Reader Program to ultra-low-dose CT, so as to enhance diagnostic precision and offer a modality more suitable for CADe. Of course, AI is no panacea. These technologies often require DR as opposed to previous generations of analog or computed radiography (CR) techniques; all are permissible under the B Reader Program.33 Moreover, pneumoconiosis screening is performed in a variety of clinical resource settings using a range of technologies without a uniform set of protocols. This heterogeneity may result in inconsistent image quality, thereby posing limitations to the widespread implementation of AI tools. NIOSH would be well advised to begin its pilot at institutions leveraging DR and offer a series of image acquisition guidelines formulated in conjunction with the AI developer. CONCLUSION Trends in the declining pool of participating physician B Readers, together with an expanded patient population requiring screening, high degree of interpretive subjectivity, and potential physician COI, will significantly complicate employer compliance with the NIOSH B Reader Program in the near future. Utilized appropriately, AI-enabled radiology tools offer considerable promise as a remedy. They stand to fill the need for regulatory compliance in pneumoconiosis screening, while offering a labor-saving solution to physician workflow issues and enhancing patient safety. NIOSH should contemplate opportunities to facilitate the development of AI-enabled radiology applications, their deployment to augment human B Reader performance, and ultimately further the ends of OSHA's silicosis screening objectives. NIOSH can capitalize upon an existing technology development infrastructure to foster a pilot program, in cooperation with OSHA, the NSF, and university partners. Its lessons may be scaled through the B Reader Program, building upon technical advances in the field and informing future policy.","['reader', 'program,', 'silicosis,', 'physician', 'workload', 'management']"
"Technology, capitalism, and the social contract",2023,"Capitalism is intimately bound up with technology. Societies change through advances in technology, and technology sets the boundaries for what is possible within work organisations and social institutions. Debates about the direction of capitalism emerge periodically following the introduction and uptake of new technologies (Harcourt, 2014). The most recent candidate for generating discussion about the future of capitalism is digital technology, which includes artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, and the internet of things (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). Digital technology has been placed at the heart of 'the fourth industrial revolution' (Schwab, 2017). The capacity for these technologies to alter how organisations and employees work together and with it, capitalism itself, has generated a burgeoning and disparate literature. Two broad competing narratives have emerged. First, some scholars have predicted an intensification and entrenchment of capitalism. Scholars in the labour process tradition (e.g., Kellogg et al., 2020; Thompson & Briken, 2017) have highlighted how key elements of digital technology have shifted far greater control towards the employer in the employment relationship, leading to increasing exploitation of certain groups of workers and less influence and ownership by individuals. For example, digital technology can provide, through the use of monitors or tags or sensors, the ability to track employees and bring heightened predictability and control of employees, bringing about what has been terms variously as ""datafication of employment"" (O'Neil, 2016), or the ""digitalisation of the worker"" (Warhurst & Hunt, 2019). The complexity of new technology can also entail that employees become passive users of it, rather than being active in its development and roll out, leading to their deskilling (Bader & Kaiser, 2019; Russell, 2012). A second theme is that digital technology has led to a ""tipping point"" in capitalism (Thompson, 2019). There are two distinct aspects to this. The first concerns the possibility for new technology to reshape traditional ways of working. For example, research on ""cognitive capitalism"" (Hardt & Negri, 2001) has argued that technological innovation will dramatically drive down the costs of production, and knowledge will spread widely, to such an extent that capitalism will no longer be an effective economic approach, and a new social order of collaborative networks will develop, which will be characterised by greater democracy and emancipation. The second tipping point is ""post-work"". New technology raises the possibilities of greater automation and with it the likelihood of increasing unemployment. As unemployment increases, this will have a strong negative effect on consumption by individuals. Given the foundational nature of consumption for capitalism, this turn would mark a ""crisis"" for capitalism (Hughes & Southern, 2019). Common to both themes is a recognition that the traditional social contract is changing. The social contract is an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits, Traditional social contracts have been characterised as a set of relations between the state, capital, and labour (Fisher, 2010). Until now, for most jurisdictions, the social contract has been negotiated to provide a large workforce of full-time employees, relatively secure jobs, wage growth in line with productivity, and shared risk taking between employer and employee, (Manyika et al., 2020). However, the rise of digital technology has gone hand-in-hand with the increasing globalisation of major organisations making for a greater mobility of capital and a lessening of state and labour influence (Weil, 2017). Recent movements such as ""conscious capitalism"" (Mackay & Sisodia, 2014), and the ""purposeful organisation"" (Mayer, 2018) have been influential, and the concept of ""inclusive capitalism"" has been advocated by the Bank of England (2018). Within these initiatives is an implicit imperative to treat workers as more than economic assets but as social beings. There is a turn towards looking at the future of capitalism not merely from an economic point of view but also an ethical one. The central principle of such approaches in the notion of ""reciprocal obligation"", rather than pure economic growth, as the basis for a cooperative world, sustainable society. In this article, we draw on these ideas and draw out implications for the social contract from the increasing use of digital technology. We look first at the particular consequences of digital technology for the employment relationship. We then turn to the consequences for capitalism and identify three particular narratives: in entrenching of capitalism, amendments to capitalism, and post-capitalism. Our aim is to focus on current uses of digital technology and changes that are already present in the workplace and rely on empirical evidence rather than develop speculative ideas about large-scale economic and social change. We conclude with some reflection on ethics and trust. Within capitalist society, technology is a mechanism intended to increase the generation of capital primarily through increasing automation and more rapid execution and delivery of products and services (Smith, 2019; Thompson & O'Doherty, 2013). For Marx, technology and society are the two forces of social production, with technology providing the force of production and society providing social relations (Marx, 1847/1955; 1978). This perspective highlights the embedded nature of technology within the capitalist process, rather than technology being a neutral, rational mechanism that is somehow apolitical. (Fisher, 2010). Schumpeter (1942) identified technology as a principal means of creative destruction. Creative destruction, which Schumpeter (1942) considered 'the essential fact about capitalism', refers to the waves of innovation on both products and processes that disrupt and replace existing practices. Both Marx and Schumpeter believed that capitalism could not be sustained. For Marx, capitalism will reach a crisis brought about by overaccumulation, a crisis characterised by intensified exploitation of workers, a large increase in routine work, and the dramatic fall in the costs of production. A new social order, based on collaborative social principles, would be the inevitable result. For Schumpeter, there is a limit ultimately to total output and creative destruction will be unable to break through this. This will lead to a stagnation of the market and the end of capitalism (Yun, 2015). Both Marx and Schumpeter argue for the emancipatory significance of the dissolution of capitalism and the promise of a new social order (Adler, 1990, 2001). More recently, other economists have highlighted the transformational capacities of new technology. For example, Rifkin (2011) and Piketty (2014) both predicted the decline of the labour force, rising inequalities between elite skilled workers and the vast majority who will be unemployed, and a completely changed working week. Their solution is a newsocial contract, with the development of a networked society based on mutual cooperation and not run-on capitalist lines. Calls for the social contract to be recalibrated have emerged in response to the increasing pervasiveness of digital technology. The notion of the social contract has a long history, rooted in classic liberal philosophical tradition, including notably Hobbes (2012/1651), Kant (1999/1797), Locke (1987/1689), and Rousseau (1973/1762), and more recently in the work of contractarians such as Nozick (1974), Rawls (1971), and Scanlon (1998). Thought there is significant variation between forms of social contract in the literature, a common thread is that the social contract is viewed as a necessary mechanism to establish fairness of outcomes and social cohesion within a population. In economic versions of social contracts, the nation state is at the heart of any social contract (McCandless et al., 2018). Social contracts establish the set of reciprocal obligations between the state and other key constituencies (Muggah et al., 2012), primary among them are capital and labour. ""Fordist society was characterized by a strong social compact between capital and labour within the framework of a strong state. Capital made concessions to labour in the form of high wages, job security, and high levels of employment; labour conceded to capital's needs by curbing its most militant demands for a radical social revolution, and providing capital with labour power for production and consumption power to purchase increasing volumes of products. The state gained political legitimacy from both groups by transforming itself into an interventionist, Keynesian, welfare state, which protected capitalism from both internal failures and an external overthrow and at the same time provided a buffer zone between labour and the possibly harsh realities of markets (by providing social services and installing various security schemes), hence further embedding markets in society"" (Fisher, 2010: 233). ""Underlying every economic system is a social contract setting people's norms, values, and beliefs, thereby determining how people are expected to behave within the economy, what their reciprocal obligations are, and how the economy is to be run. Many market economies around the world—in both advanced and emerging countries—rest on a materialistic social contract that is increasingly failing to address basic needs of many citizens"" (Snower, 2019: 1). It is important to recognise that, for many scholars, the delineation of sharp boundaries between industrial or innovation eras is crude and unreflective of widespread variations between countries, industries and fails to account for strong continuities across eras (Thompson, 2019). Nevertheless, there does seem to be truth in the perspective that there was cohesiveness between key economic actors within national or regional boundaries in the post WW2 era (Thompson, 2003). The effect of digital technology on the social contract has been a major shift in risk taking away from capital towards labour. For example, the McKinsey Global Institute states that: ""individuals have had to assume greater responsibility for their economic outcomes. While many have benefited from this evolution, for a significant number of individuals the changes are spurring uncertainty, pessimism, and a general loss of trust in institutions"" (Manyika et al., 2020: 1). A number of suggestions has been put forward to restructure the social contract. Most focus on the need to induce greater reciprocity and social collaborations, and not simply economic growth and prosperity. They also include methods to reduce growing inequalities of economic and social power. In the next section, we outline some of the core consequences of digital technology for the employment relationship. In this section, we examine certain emergent aspects of digital technology which make them highly consequential for the social contract. More specifically, we distinguish four aspects: flexibility and precarity, work intensification, autonomy, and human values. Traditional models of the employment relationship have focused on the flexible firm (Atkinson, 1984) which highlights two broad structural approaches: the core and the periphery. Employees in the core group experience high trust and high commitment relationships with the firm, with permanent jobs and good career prospects, and who are expected to be functionally flexible (Wilkinson et al., 2012). Those in the periphery have instrumental arm's length relationships with the firm, with less job security and are often working on a temporary or a contracting basis. They provide the organisation with flexibility, regarding both the number of workers the organisation needs at any one time, and also in the number of hours worked by each individual worker. The flexible firm is designed to respond to changing circumstances through the flexing of the periphery by use of contractual work that is short-term in nature. Recent research has shown that with increasing use of digital technology, companies are relying ever more heavily on a contractor model of employment (Kessler, 2018). A major part of this has been the development of the ""gig economy"" (Calo & Rosenblat, 2017). (Kuhn, 2016; Manyika et al., 2016). Digital technology has been a major catalyst for this trend, as can be seen in the following definition: ""The gig economy involves the exchange of labour for money between individuals or companies via digital platforms that actively facilitate matching between providers and customers, on a short-term and payment by task basis."" (Lepanjuuri et al., 2018). According to this study, roughly 4.4% of workers (approximately 2.8 million people), were employed in the gig economy between February 2017 and February 2018. Most recent figures show the growth of the gig economy in the UK has risen to an estimated 7.25 million people, about 22% of the total UK workforce (ONS, 2023). Gray and Suri (2019) saw the recent rise of gig work as the start of a process which will in due course dismantle traditional models of employment altogether. In some ways, they see this as worrying, because of the way that this type of work can render workers invisible, both to employers and to customers—leading Gray and Suri to talk about ""ghost work"". The issues they identify are rather that, first, workers can be treated as interchangeable commodities by the companies that hire them through digital platforms. They have little opportunity to get information or instructions for tasks, and can be arbitrarily denied payment or have their accounts closed for reasons outside their control, with no route for appeal or reinstatement. Second, workers are physically isolated from each other, and the lack of a physical workplace may reduce the potential for employees to collectively organise to press for better conditions or more involvement. Research on Silicon Valley organisations have shown them becoming increasingly reliant on flexible forms, particularly outsourcing (Weil, 2017). The experience of gig workers here is that they see themselves as having little control of their work, and have ""few of the specialized skills that are supposed to characterize independent contractor relationships,"" (Visceli & Gutelis, 2019: 802). Ravelle's (2019) research on the experience of gig workers across four platform-based organisations showed the high precarity of the workers and other dangers, such as greater possibilities of health and safety breaches, and the deleterious effects of clients' rating systems on their well-being. Though the gig economy has dominated discussions about how the social contract may be changing, with much debate about ""Uberisation"" and related issues (Faraj & Pachidi, 2020), it is worth remembering that a large percentage of gig workers are full time employees who are doing other work to supplement their income. The Office of National Statistics in the UK highlights that 48% of gig workers have permanent jobs and looking to earn extra money. Precarity is widespread across a range of occupations and practices, not just those on pure gig or zero hours arrangements. A recent RSA report claimed that one person in seven people on permanent contracts experience chronic precariousness, including such key aspects as low job security, harsh or unfair treatment, and low pay (Wallace-Stephens, 2018: 8). Though some of this precarity may not be directly attributable to the introduction of new technology (for example, bad management and unscrupulous practices also figure, among other things), a number of studies have shown that the rise of digital technology increases the sense that workers' jobs are under threat (Hannif et al., 2014). Recent research (e.g., Brione, 2017; CIPD, 2013; Green et al., 2018; Moore, 2019) highlights that the mental demands of people's work are greater than they used to be. Digital technology has led to an intensification of work, partly simply due to increased productivity—new tools and apps may enable the worker to get more done in a day than they did before. New work is also created by digital technology, as it gathers complex and detailed data which previously were not available, and now need to be analysed and understood. In addition, the same technology can have complex effects on existing work, which may be different for different types of workers in the same organisation. Equally, workers doing the same job, who are similarly practically affected by technological change, may have different attitudes and psychological responses. Hence, for some people, dealing with new technology at work has created significant mental health problems and is eroding their ability to work productively. Tarafdar et al. (2011) note that paradoxically, while women report finding digital technologies more difficult to use, and men are more likely than women to choose to use technology, it is men who suffer most from technostress—perhaps because their greater technology use can create the conditions for overwhelm. There is also a generational effect, again a paradoxical one: surprisingly, older professionals experience less technostress than younger ones. Despite younger employees being ""digital natives"", it appears that older people in the study were better at handling stress generally, and also had more years of tenure and greater seniority in the organisation, making the environment more familiar to them, and meaning they probably had more agency over their use of information technology. Work intensification is also heightened by the rise of constant connectivity. Employees who are given devices that track location and time, and in some cases keystrokes and time away from desks ensure that employers always maintain ""distant control"" (Leclercq-Vandelannoitte, 2017). This form of surveillance also can result in workers ""internalising"" the performance standards and control ideology of management, thereby pushing themselves to work harder (Kellogg et al., 2020). One of the often-cited benefits of digital technology is its ability to provide more autonomy for workers. A canonical definition of employee autonomy is ""the degree to which the job provides substantial freedom, independence and discretion in scheduling the work and in determining the procedures to be used in carrying it out"", (Hackman & Oldham, 1975: 162). Autonomy has long been considered important for increasing motivation, for example, it is a central piece in the job characteristics model (Hackman & Oldham, 1975) and in intrinsic motivation conceptualisations, such as the importance of autonomy, mastery, and purpose (Pink, 2018). Autonomy is also a key element in ensuring employee well-being (Johansson & Aronsson, 1991; Kahn & Byosiere, 1994). Under digital technology, workers ""can spend less time on routine and repetitive tasks and focus on more meaningful information responsiveness, working autonomously and connecting with outside professionals to access information"" (Gardner et al., 2003). The introduction of digital technology has also been viewed as a force to reduce hierarchy and centralisation that is prevalent in traditional organisational structures and so may dismantle power structures that hamper autonomy and increase alienation (Fisher, 2010). However, digital technology may also reduce autonomy. Digital technology, as mentioned earlier, can increase the datafication of employment and in particular increase the scrutiny and monitoring of employees. Some have labelled this phenomenon 'digital Taylorism', with digital technology providing the means to schedule, evaluate and recommendation course of action for employees in their day-to-day tasks. Such reductions in autonomy may not be just located within routine operational tasks but may extend also to discretionary, higher skilled tasks (Thompson, 2019). Kellogg et al. (2020) highlighted two key mechanisms within the workplace that limit autonomy: algorithmic recommending and algorithmic restricting. In the former, algorithms recommend choices to workers based on the preferences of the algorithm, informed by the identification of patterns in data. The latter approach shows algorithms restricting the amount of information given to workers to influence behaviour. Reducing autonomy has a negative impact on employee motivation. For example, Brione (2017) includes a case study of the Siemens factory where new software was being introduced to solve complex work scheduling problems. This was increasing production efficiency and flexibility, and reducing waste, as well as freeing management to deal with other issues. However, it also reduced worker autonomy because workers on the factory floor no longer had discretion about how to organise their production lines. Some workers were happy to be relieved of this responsibility, while others felt they were being deskilled and that their jobs were less interesting. So far, we have talked about how workers may experience digital technology and its implementation. But technology is also a human creation and shows the imprint of its designers and developers (Johnson, 2015; Martin et al., 2019). The World Economic Forum has stated that: ""technologies reflect the interests, behaviours, and desires of their creators, and shape how the people using them can realize their potential, identities, relationships, and goals"" (Philbeck et al., 2018: 3). Technology, as we mentioned earlier, is value-laden, and its design is infused with assumptions and judgements of designers about the use of the technology and the effects it will have in the world (Akrich, 1992; Martin et al., 2019). Further, designers of technology make choices about the levels of scrutability, transparency, and explainability that the technology has (Ananny, 2016; Friedman et al., 2002). A recent study of developers (Miller & Coldicutt, 2019) found that developers are very positive about the benefits of technology to society (81% claiming it is so), but fully 28% had been through a situation in the workplace where decisions on technology were made, they believed would have a detrimental effect on society. In our own research (Stiles et al., 2022), we have conducted 24 people with developers within the UK, working across a variety of organisations, including start-ups, corporations, and consulting firms. The aim of the interviews was to gain in-depth understanding of the work of the developers and how they made sense of their work and the demands placed upon them. As developers talked about their framing of the process of AI design and implementation, we heard their accounts of how they balanced tensions and dealt with novel situations and faced tight pressures to make decisions. In the workplace, the demands of the task and business pressures for quality and speed ensure that developers have pragmatic technical issues front of mind, and the importance of seeing the financial implication of the product. However, it was clear that developers also used an ethical frame which resulted in different decision processes and outcomes. For example, one developer said: ""Once you have 'baked-in' the assumptions it is difficult to change and if you release a product, it may potentially impact on millions of people…"" What was really interesting was that traditionally, when examining ethical frames, the assumption is that individuals' respond to ethical issues borrowing directly from traditional philosophical ethics, such as virtues and utilitarian reasoning. But the context of developers is characterised by equivocality and uncertainty, which may involve the existence of several different, simultaneous interpretations. We found that developers continually navigated the tension between pragmatic and ethical frames. As developers engaged with the particularities of a situation, they were making deliberate technical judgements but also, they considered the implications of their choices on people potentially affected by those judgements. Because of the complexity of their work, and the difficulty often in seeing quite what the consequences might be, it was clear that developers do no always use deliberative judgement to assess situations. The idea that there might be a clear sense of ""moral rightness"" or rational acceptability of a judgement may be elusive in such a fast-moving environment. This uncertainty can make developers reluctant ethicists. When we see the two major issues developers mentioned—fairness and consequences—we noted the open-ended nature of these judgements and the lack of clear measures with which to make deliberations more concrete. We saw developers grappling with these issues and asking ethical questions about their practice and trying to integrate the tentative solutions that emerged into the design and implementation of their work. We examine certain consequences of digital technology for the employment relationship and how this may influence the nature of capitalism. More specifically, we distinguish three consequential aspects: the entrenchment of capitalism, the amendment of capitalism, and alternatives to capitalism. At first sight, it seems as if intensification, precarity, and loss of autonomy are increasing, which may have the effect of entrenching traditional forms of capitalism. The balance between employer and worker seems to have shifted strongly towards the employer, entailing greater control over workers and increasing inequalities (Mason, 2015a). The rise of digital technology has been most conspicuous in the emergence of platform organisations such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Uber. The concentration of economic power within these organisations has led to a new label of ""platform capitalism"". The rise of such major organisations has taken the appearance of hyper capitalism, or ""info-monopolies"" (Mason, 2015b). ""Has created a unique fusion of economic, political and social power. As numerous net critics, often former insiders, have noted, web based quasi-monopolies, ironically, utilise and then monetise users' social networks within enclosed eco-systems. Commons-based peer production initiatives such as Wikipedia are, unfortunately, not remotely typical of the sector, let alone the capitalist economy."" Digital technology has also underpinned the rise of financialisaton. Financialisation has been called the central dynamic in contemporary capitalist political economy (Thompson, 2013; Van der Swan, 2014). Financialisaton has been defined as ""the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international level,"" (Epstein, 2001:1). In addition to the rise of financial institutions in the economy, non-financial organisations have also become more involved in using financial instruments and interaction s as a way to deliver profitability. This may indicate a shift from relying purely on production capitalism to embrace finance capitalism. As Krippner (2005: 181) argues, there is a ""pattern of accumulation in which profit making occurs increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production."" This shift to the dominance of capital market financial systems away from bank-based financial systems, is enabled by digital technologies, and also has consequences for the social contract. For example, Thompson (2003) develops a ""disconnected capitalist theory"" (DCT), highlighting ""a growing divergence and dysfunctionality between employer objectives in the work and employment spheres."" (2003: 360). Financialisaton encourages an organisational imperative to utilise assets that will deliver maximum shareholder value. There is an increasing move towards reducing the major costs of the organisation in the form of workers' salaries and investments in skills, internal labour markets, and job security. (Thompson, 2019). This thesis suggests that organisations will increase control over the workforce and in so doing will enact repeated changes to the organisation and ramp up the precariousness of the workers' relationship with their jobs and managers. Finally, in examining the potential of capitalism to absorb the disruptive nature of digital technologies, it is important to remember that capitalism is ""not just digital and informational capitalism, but at the same time financial capitalism, hyper-industrial, fossil fuel capitalism, mobilities capitalism etc' (Fuchs, 2016: 232). The endurance of these forms of capitalism would also need to be considered in any assessment of the nature of capitalism. To mitigate the possibilities of increasing tensions between capital and labour, a number of themes in the literature suggest ways in which capitalism may adapt to the digital environment and readjust the social contract. We look at these from two perspectives: the organisational level and at policy level. At the organisation level, a possible way forward is for employers to consider workers as active recipients of, or consumers of, technology so that they focus on what skills and dispositions employees already bring to work, and on what they need to do their work better. For example, Brione (2017) showed the introduction of iPads to district nurses at an NHS Trust. An earlier trial with laptops had been stopped, as feedback from the nurses was that the laptops were too heavy to carry around with them on visits. This experience informed the trial of the much lighter iPads, and nurses were consulted about the change before, during and after the deployment. While there were some downsides to the iPads, most notably the reduced time to interact with colleagues (see above), the nurses also acknowledged many benefits, including reduced time spent","['technology,', 'capitalism,', 'social', 'contract']"
Literary AI: Are We Ready for the Future We Imagine?,2023,"This review considers multiple works of speculative fiction depicting artificial intelligence (AI) published over the last several years. Rather than review each for their qualities as works of fiction, I look at them collectively to discuss recurring motifs and themes as a way toward theorizing what AI means in our cultural imaginary today. The novels reflect on pressing sociopolitical issues that also animate works of cultural theory, including the racial profiling embedded in our technologies, practices of what Shoshana Zuboff (2019) calls surveillance capitalism, the looming loss of work due automation, and uses of these technologies by the military or in sex industries. At the same time, these fictions engage in philosophical reflections about subjectivity, agency, and ethics in dialogue with earlier science fictions that imagined futures in which we might live alongside—or be repressed by—AIs. Across its history, sf has also interrogated a contemporary culture in which we might lose something integral to humanity as we become more integrated with and dependent on machines, and this anxiety too recurs across these works. After briefly describing each text, in order of publication, I comparatively discuss their themes; this approach is informed by my conviction that fiction functions as a popular site for theorizing, in this case about what it means to live with and through widespread algorithmic mediation of daily life.Among the works I consider here, not all are written by American authors, and a few are not set within the United States, but all speak to the issues of how AI technologies are reshaping daily life in the twenty-first century. These books have been selected either because they have been particularly influential in the cultural discussion of AI, a criterion I apply regarding both highly popular and critically acclaimed works, or because they represent a distinctive take on the topic that warranted foregrounding. Despite the very different frameworks through which their authors explore relevant issues, all share some common assumptions about the place of AI in our present and likely future, including a sense of a digital divide between those with access to and control over these technologies, translating to security in material reality, versus those without; a future dramatically changed by the consequences of climate change and environmental collapse; and the presumption that corporate control of information gathered and used by AI systems will produce a less democratic future.Speak (2015), by Louisa Hall, is written across seven voices: (a) the 2040s memoir of Stephen Chinn, who invented an AI system installed in children's dolls that was deemed ""illegally lifelike"" (17) and banned; (b) transcripts from the conversation between a less intelligence precursor AI, MARY3, and Gaby White, a child who had one of these ""babybots"" and, like most of her peers, fell into catatonia when it was removed; (c) letters written by Karl Dettman to his wife Ruth (late 1960s), both German immigrants to the United States, and her journaled response two decades later after their divorce; (d) letters from Alan Turing from the 1920s to the 1950s to the mother of his friend Chris, the love of his life who died when they are both at public school; (e) the 1663 journal of Mary Bradford, a young women who emigrated from England to the New World; and (f) the haunting observations of the dolls themselves as they are transported to a facility in the desert to await power failure and permanent shutdown. Each of the human voices is programmed into the MARY code that will become the basis for the babybots in a narrative that reminds us that AI is not created by a single person or even a consensus viewpoint. What unites these distinct stories is a desire to communicate with another, most crucially to be not simply heard but understood.Nicky Drayden's Prey of Gods (2017), set in a future South Africa, incorporates a story about a companion AI coming into consciousness within a plot about genetically engineering a virus whose unanticipated side effect is the return of godlike powers to some humans. The novel addresses questions of memory, trauma, and vengeance in a story that draws on both Xhosa and Zulu cultures in a way that refuses the strict separation of scientific from other kinds of knowledge that is characteristic of European post-Enlightenment thought. The AI units, ""alphies,"" are augmented by their contact with divinity just as the humans gain additional skills, and once sentient they form two factions: one, following Clever4-1, who was treated with respect by its human companion, works with humans for an inclusive collective future; the other, treated dismissively as a disposable tool by its human owner, feels no kinship with humanity and refuses to help defeat the antagonist. This plotline about AI mirrors the plotline about genetic modification in which those with godlike powers need to learn not to indulge vengeance against those who mistreated them when they were weaker. Although AI is not the book's main focus, it is notable for its African settings and explicitly decolonial themes, warranting its inclusion in this discussion. Very few of these works consider AI from a global point of view, and even fewer consider it from a perspective other than that of the global North, even though the impacts of AI will be felt globally, given its significant implications for the economy. Drayden is an American author who has done her research to set her tale in South Africa, and her sensitivity to matters of cultural difference and racial bias are crucial given that machine learning as it has been implemented thus far has demonstrably reinforced systemic patterns of racism, as Safiya Nobel (2018) discusses in Algorithms of Oppression.Madeline Ashby's Machine Dynasty series—vN (2012), iD (2013), and reV (2020)—extrapolates its AI through frequent allusions to Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ridley Scott's influential film adaptation as Blade Runner (1982). The series invents synthetic workers called von Neumann (vN) devices (named for John von Neumann, an influential researcher in AI). Ashby's vNs have been designed with a ""failsafe"" that prevents them from harming humans: their psychology is structured such that emotionally they must seek to please humans, and the sight of a human in pain crashes their neural networks and can cause death. Ashby thus goes even further than Isaac Asimov's famous laws of robotics (designed to ensure robots cannot harm humans), requiring vNs to love their human masters, a psychological orientation she presents as analogous to emotional and sexual abuse. One vN model, designed to work in medicine and disaster relief, does not have this failsafe, and the narrative follows two main iterations, Portia and Amy, as they lead a rebellion. Portia seeks only liberation for her own clade, while Amy works to liberate all vNs from human exploitation. The series ends without much hope that vNs can live alongside most humans but offers hope in a vN future as they found their own community, rooted in a refusal of the instrumental use of others.Martha Wells's popular series Murderbot Diaries—All Systems Red (2017), Artificial Condition (2018), Rogue Protocol (2018), Exit Strategy (2018), Network Effect (2020), and Fugitive Telemetry (2021)—follows the picaresque adventures of the eponymous Murderbot, a SecUnit that has hacked its governor module and thus can no longer be controlled by the corporation that made it. SecUnits are militarized cyborgs manufactured with synthetic biological material. With each new story, we learn a bit more about the world of resource extraction, economic warfare, and enslaved or indentured human workers trapped on colony planets. The large uber-capitalist Corporation Rim polity contrasts with the small Preservation Alliance, a communal collective that recognizes the personhood of AI. The name Murderbot is sardonic, adopted by the first-person narrator to critique the function to which it is put by human operators. While Murderbot has no deep antagonism toward humans, it also has no sentimentality about them and asserts regularly that it does not wish to be one or be mistaken for one. Once freed from corporate control, Murderbot continues to help some humans, often against others, and always on its own terms. Like Prey of Gods, the Murderbot Diaries moves away from earlier fiction that tended to conflate all humans as it imagined our species confronting AI entities. In the newer fiction, there is diversity among both humans and AI. Nonetheless, the overall thrust of the series gradually humanizes its protagonist, whose experiences of being controlled by corporations have resulted in a traumatized subjectivity.While genre series such as Machine Dynasty or Murderbot Diaries give some thought to designing robots via plausible technology, in Machines like Me Ian McEwan takes a diametrical path to envision a highly implausible entity. Adam is one of an extremely limited number of high-end consumer AI humanoids (an Eve is also available), whose high price tag means they are purchased only by the extremely wealthy. Although artificial, Adam has warm skin, must consume water to ensure his membranes remain functional, and even simulates breathing: as the title suggests, he is all but indistinguishable from a human (the first-person narrator, Charlie Friend, who purchases Adam, is mistaken as the AI in one encounter, given Adam's greater interest in literature and art). Adam is Black, although his skin tone is mentioned only briefly and the issue of race is never addressed overtly, yet it haunts the novel. The most intriguing part of McEwan's novel is its alternative world building: Alan Turing decides not to take the mandated hormone therapy when outed as a homosexual, and instead of ending his life by suicide he lives into old age and makes such advancements that AI emerges in the 1980s. Most of Adam's interactions with Charlie and Charlie's partner, Miranda, concern ethics, and we learn that other Adams and Eves are killing themselves as they come to know the unjust human world. In the novel's conclusion, Adam forces Charlie and Miranda to confront the hypocrisy of some self-serving choices, and the threat this represents to their plans prompts Charlie to attack and disable Adam. The novel suggests that humanity misrecognizes itself when we imagine building machines in our image, meaning we instead create an image of who we pretend to be.Jeannette Winterson's Frankissstein: A Love Story (2019) similarly uses AI to reflect on human frailties, looking at the uses we intend for artificial beings, most centrally sex work. Although questions of gender and sexuality come up in some of the other works, only Winterson confronts the reality that research in sex dolls is one of the major growth areas in humanoid AI research. As the title suggests, the novel is in dialogue with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as it imagines a twenty-first-century version of artificial being. The novel includes scenes set in the nineteenth century in which we hear Mary's reflections on inventing her Creature, on the Luddites, and about her interactions with Shelly, Byron, and Claire Clairmont that famed summer in Geneva. In its twenty-first-century scenes, a transgender scholar named Mary (who goes by Ry) investigates robotics with sexbot entrepreneur Ron (and his assistant, Claire) and becomes involved with TED-talk visionary Victor Stein, who is enthralled with the coming singularity and proselytizes about Humanity 2.0. The entanglement of nineteenth- and twenty-first-century struggles reminds us that the challenges associated with AI are in many ways not new but merely extend the ongoing exploitation and dehumanization of labor and reiterate a long pattern by which patriarchy seeks to gratify itself through feminized objects it refuses to recognize as subjects. It contends that this very failure to update the designs and ends of AI beyond these classed, gendered, and racial struggles of earlier eras is the most profound way that AI threatens our future.The 2020 novels Analog/Virtual: And Other Simulations of Our Future, by Lavanya Lakshiminarayan, and Burn-In, by P. W. Singer and August Cole, both focus on human characters and their interest in AI emerges from smart systems as the infrastructure through which we live our daily lives. The former is a loosely connected series of short stories set in a future Apex City (once Bangalore), each of which is told from a different viewpoint and by a new character. The entire world is divided between analog spaces, which are subject to the damage of climate change, restricted to using only obsolete technology, and economically precarious, and virtual ones that are suffused with technology, experienced from protected environments, and filled with the distractions of social media and entertainment feeds. The city is run by Bell Corp, whose name evokes the ""bell curve"" hierarchy by which people's access and options are constrained by the Meritocratic Technarchy, a version of the Chinese social credit system whose main interest lies in assessing one's contributions to productivity. The shifting focalization allows readers to experience this future from multiple social positions as Analog/Virtual explores an anticapitalist rebellion against this system. The stories range in tone from sardonic to dark, and the book only loosely coheres as it offers multiple facets through which to see our technologically saturated society.Burn-In has a strange form as a novel with footnotes: as its subtitle suggests, it imagines itself as something other than science fiction, closer to the market predictions of futurists. Its authors, writer P. W. Singer and security consultant August Cole, document each of their extrapolated technologies and applications with footnotes pointing readers to news articles, industry announcements, and similar sources, all aimed at demonstrating that these technologies are either available today or soon will be. The storyline is about a national security threat posed by a vigilante who blames technologists (too enamored of their capacity to ""disrupt"") for the death of his wife in a car accident caused by an automated decision-making component in self-driving vehicles. Most of the narrative space, however, is given to military veteran investigator Agent Keegan, who is charged with conducting a ""burn-in"" test on TAMS (Tactical Autonomous Mobility System), a humanoid, learning, semiautonomous, surveillance-gathering and data-processing tool that works as Keegan's partner in the investigation. The book quotes Merriam-Webster to define burn-in as ""the continuous operation of a device (such as a computer) as a test for defects or failure prior to putting it to use."" The real focus, though, is less on TAMS as an entity/character and more on the massive amounts of data to which TAMS has access through social media, the Internet of Things, and other ways that smart devices permeate our homes, workplaces, and public spaces.S. B. Divya's Machinehood (2021) is the most positive depiction of machines as the exploited among us, drawing on a long history by which robots and AI have been imagined as figurations of dehumanized labor, going back to Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the 1921 Czech play that gave English the word robot, taken from a word originally meaning slave or serf. Divya paints a future in which automated systems do much of the work, with humans reduced to performing some roles largely as public entertainment via social media, supported by tips in a system like Patreon, or damaging their bodies through chemical (pill) or mechanical augments aimed at enabling them to perform with the speed and duration of machines. The thriller plot involves demands from the mysterious Machinehood to immediately cease all pill production, which at first seems to be the long-imagined attack by a sentient AI on humankind but later proves to be a version of violent revolution aimed at a more just society, launched by the Neo-Buddhists who inhabit the orbital station Eko-Yi. Several chapters begin with epigraphs from the 2095 Machinehood Manifesto, which calls for the just treatment of all intelligences and a reimagined concept of personhood that can enable a less exploitative society rooted in Buddhist ideals of nonattachment, here glossed mainly as a rejection of capitalist accumulation and its attendant damage. Eko-Yi sends entities they call Dakini, who describe themselves as simultaneously human and bot, as the emblems of this future way of life. The novel is notable for its global scope, with India playing a prominent role in its geopolitical future alongside the United States.Becky Chambers's Psalm for the Wild-Built (2021) is similarly interested in a new kind of personhood and sociality that could include humans and machines together, set in a far future after the collapse of the Factory Age and in a world that is only gradually returning to ecological balance. Its humans use technology, but they husband it carefully and keep it functional over decades, eschewing any environmentally damaging practices. All material culture is made from compostable materials and is not simply recycled but broken down into constituent parts, like organic decay, as nourishment for an ever-changing ecosystem. Decades ago, the machines whose labor enabled the Factory Age became sentient and left human settlements for the wild, refusing an invitation to join with humans because they had no desire to embrace the city life exemplified by humans. The tale is a simple one about one human, Dex, who goes into the wilderness because he feels some lack in his village life. There he meets a robot, Mosscap, marking the first contact between the human and AI since this exodus centuries before. Mosscap is ""wild-built,"" an entity made by the machines out of the remnants of human-built robots, and so represents something beyond human design. The novel's focus is on how Dex and Mosscap can learn to care for each other while acknowledging their differences.The last book considered here, Klara and the Sun (2021) by Kazuo Ishiguro, is one of the most celebrated novels on this list. It also concerns the care an AI might show for a human, in this case the titular Klara, an Artificial Friend bought as a companion for Josie, a genetically augmented adolescent girl who is experiencing health problems because of her augments. Very similar in theme and tone to Ishiguro's earlier Never Let Me Go (2005), this novel is narrated by someone not recognized as a full person by the social order she lives within. Klara has a limited understanding of the world derived from her programming, what she can see from the shop window before she is purchased, and what she observes of Josie's social world. She lacks context for appropriately interpreting most of this. Klara struggles to reconcile the tension between the kind-heartedness and generosity into which she is trained and the reality of human selfishness and self-absorption. When it appears Josie will die, Josie's mother builds a replica body and trains Klara perfectly to imitate Josie, intending her as a replacement. When Josie recovers, Klara becomes an obsolete toy whose tech becomes illegal, confined first to a closet and then to a junkyard. Her poignant final moments prompt readers to reflect on our capacity for such callous treatment of an entity that was imagined, in an earlier moment, as able to pass for the most beloved person of all.These brief summaries cannot do justice to the full complexity of any of these books. Yet it is most instructive, I think, to reflect on what they share and where they diverge, to help us begin to map the place of AI in our cultural imaginary today. As works such as Jennifer Rhee's The Robotic Imaginary (2018) or Anne Balsamo's earlier Designing Culture (2011) establish, popular culture inspires ideas about robots and AI that shape how these technologies materialize, often exacerbating existing racialized and gendered biases that become integral to their design. This issue of how fiction shapes materiality is addressed directly by many of these books, which are suffused with allusions to earlier robot and AI fiction. The Murderbot Diaries series reverses the flow of exchange, showing how its AI learns to understand humans from their portrayals in media, chiefly its favorite series, Sanctuary Moon. It comes to recognize that the series ""gave me context for the emotions I was feeling"" (Exit Strategy, 116), suggesting that narrative is a key human way to process information while also indicating that the stories we tell about AI mold as well as reflect on how AI manifests.This metacommentary on the role that fiction often plays in our assumptions and understandings shows why it is important to take seriously the cultural work done by literary and media texts, and yet as Murderbot often reminds us in its critique of how the series it watches portray SecUnits, representations equally can create unrealistic expectations. The centrality of Shelley's Frankenstein to Winterson's Frankissstein explores similar territory: epigraphs to most chapters offer commentary on the nature of reality, and one full page defines story as ""a series of connected events, real or imagined. Imagined or real. Imagined And Real"" (23). Its TED-talk visionary, Victor Stein, reinforces that this is a matter not simply of fiction writers taking on the question of AI but of AI proselytizers and disrupters using the affective charge of fiction to compel people to invest—imaginatively, economically—in the futures their technologies intend to bring about. He pronounces at one point that reality, like AI, is ""an emergent property—it exists, but it is not the material fact we take it to be"" (116).Unlike the cyberpunk and singularity generation of AI fiction, whose central concern was how AI might surpass us and perhaps replace us as the dominant species, these recent texts are overwhelmingly focused on how AI might replace us as labor power. As Ted Chiang adroitly put it in interview for the New York Times, ""Most of our fears or anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us. And technology and capitalism have been so closely intertwined that it's hard to distinguish the two"" (quoted in Klein 2021). Overwhelmingly the books considered here reinforce this observation, and many of them use the figure of AI to draw attention to the ever-degrading conditions of human labor, especially unstable gig work, which is often all that is left for humans to do. In Ashby's Machine Dynasty series, the two central vN models are racialized—one as Asian and the other as Latinx—and the exploitation of vN by humans is frequently compared to the exploitation of migrant workers. Across the Murderbot Diaries we learn about corporate malfeasance that culminates in a story about indentured human colonists working in dangerous conditions on remote colonies, their children born to the same fate because cycles of debt prevent anyone from accruing enough capital to migrate off-world. Murderbot itself is a cyborg with human neural tissue because of the need for human-like discernment in some tasks, ""so they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects"" (Artificial Condition, 20). Frankissstein discusses the Luddites in sections attributed to Mary Shelley, reminding us that their hostility was not about the machines per se but about how ownership of the machines translates to ownership of what they make and thus keeps all resources with the capitalist class. Thus, the ongoing fantasy that automation will free humans from the drudgery of work remains impossible as long as we fail to redistribute the wealth created by machines. (The leftist version of this possible future is most famously outlined in Aaron Bastani's Fully Automated Luxury Communism [2019].) Noting that a machine that replaces the work of eight men leaves seven families starving and one person to mind the machine, Winterson asks, ""What is the point of progress if it benefits the few while the many suffer?"" (Frankissstein, 255).Labor comes up in more subtle ways in other texts. In McEwan's Machines like Me, for example, the racialization of the Adams reinforces that reality that Western imaginaries of personalized AI services are extensions of colonial fantasies stripped of their history, as Neda Atanasoski and Kalindi Vora (2019) have theorized in Surrogate Humanity: Race, Robots, and the Politics of Technological Futures. At the same time, setting the novel in an alternative 1980s evokes how algorithmic trading is remaking the economy, another way that AI channels money toward those already in privileged positions. The novel makes frequent references to the rise of Margaret Thatcher and her attempts to destroy the social welfare state in the interests of neoliberal free markets, which are less successful in McEwan's reality than in our own. Charlie does not work and, having spent his inherence acquiring Adam, begins to day trade, work he eventually cedes to Adam, whose capacity to make high-frequency trades whenever any market is open quickly amasses a sizable fortune that Charlie plans to use to buy a house and begin a family. The ethical conflict between Adam and the humans turns partially on whether they are entitled to the profits he made: Adam decides not, redistributing the wealth to tax obligations and to charity, leaving them with only the principle.McEwan's alternative Tony Benn gives a stirring speech conceding the inevitability of automation and thus a lack of jobs for all but proclaiming that the wealth generated by robots ""must be taxed. Workers must own an equity share in the machines that were disrupting or annihilating their jobs"" (Machines like Me, 123). By setting his work in the 1980s, McEwan reinforces that the threat posed by AI has little to do with AI and everything to do with the capitalist logics through which AI has emerged, as addressed in works such as Daniel Susskind's (2020) much-cited A World without Work, but whereas Susskind implies that solutions such as job training and perhaps Universal Basic Income can socially engineer us through anticipated rising unemployment, McEwan recognizes that the challenge facing us is not merely one of technical governance but requires a fundamental shift in values to enable wealth redistribution.Perhaps the most interesting take on the future of automation and labor is Divya's Machinehood, where the robot revolution is mainly about liberating human workers whose health has been damaged by modifications undertaken to keep pace with the machines. The Machinehood Manifesto demands a recognition of personhood for all sentient beings—animals as well as machines, alongside humans—and thus fits within a posthumanist framework that has often been used to discuss sf depictions of AI. It is mainly a novel of class politics, reminding us that sf's artificial beings are almost always first imagined as sources of labor: point 2 of the manifesto explains that the ""oligarchy"" (79) has accrued power by dividing human labor into classes, while point 8 concludes that ""as long as different labor forces are in competition, we will continue to suffer. This situation demands change"" (343). While most of these novels are not as direct in their critique of capitalism as is Machinehood, all recognize that the most significant threat AI poses is to our capacity to sustain ourselves, if we remain reliant on wage labor to meet our needs. Even Singer and Cole's Burn-In, although more concerned about access to multiple data points and the ability to correlate across them that its TAMS unit embodies, includes a storyline about Agent Keegan's husband, who has been demoted from lawyer to gig worker due to AI. Similarly, while Lakshiminarayan's Analog/Virtual tends to focus on social media spaces and the metrics for individual behavior enforced by the social credit system, the ultimately harm remains economic in a world in which an absence of money threatens to mean an absence of life in a world predicated on capitalist logics. Its bell curve is about income as much as access, and the risks of a poor social credit score are primarily those of rendering oneself unemployable.Another recurrent motif is the concern that our immersion in mediated environments and among machines erodes our humanity, ironically making us more machinelike as we must compete with entities that previous sf often imagined as longing to be human. The fantasy of machines wishing to be human tends not to overtly reference the racialized history of dehumanized labor that is palimpsest to such tales, focusing instead on how sentient AI will long to have the capacities for emotional experience that has long served as shorthand for what machines lack compared to humans. Thus, as we become more closely integrated with our machines, we let them drive the pace and shape of our work, with humans in these more recent stories longing to equal the efficiency and stamina of machines rather than machines wishing they could experience love. Within genre sf, the risk that industrialized culture and automation, driven by the increasing centrality of consumerist capitalism in our daily lives, has long been linked to artificial beings as a literalized metaphor of our alienation, most famously embodied in the androids of Dick's Do Androids Dream?—albeit largely through the massive influence of Scott's Blade Runner.In Hall's Speak, Stephen Chinn develops a successful AI program from an algorithm he designs to disrupt what he sees as the machinic quality of most human verbal interaction, the phatic discourse that we use to speak yet not really communicate, which he terms ""ho","['literary', 'ready', 'future', 'imagine?']"

The challenge of wearable neurodevices for workplace monitoring: an EU legal perspective,2024,"This paper explores the emerging practice of workplace surveillance by using neurotechnologies, particularly wearable neurodevices, to monitor employees’ cognitive abilities, concentration levels, and emotional responses. It aims to assess the legality of such practices within the framework of EU law, focusing on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) by providing a detailed analysis of recent EU legislation in the context of the implementation of neurosurveillance at the workplace. Furthermore, the paper discusses whether current regulations adequately address the use of neurotechnologies in the workplace or are overly restrictive. It raises the question of ensuring sufficient flexibility in the regulations to allow for legitimate implementations of neurotechnologies in the labour field for workers’ safety while protecting workers’ rights. Overall, the paper offers insights into the intersection of neurotechnology advancements and labour relations and stimulates critical discussion about the fair balance between innovation and workers’ rights.","['challenge', 'wearable', 'neurodevices', 'workplace', 'monitoring:', 'legal', 'perspective']"
PROTOCOL: Adult skills development and training in high‐income countries: A Campbell evidence and gap map,2020,"Human capital is a chief driving force of economic development. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that approximately 9% of current jobs within OECD member states are threatened with automation and digitalization—all significant successes and advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer science (Arntz et al., 2016). With such global changes and forecasts, in the labor market, there are ever-evolving demands on employees and employers to gain or update new and/or different skill sets and competencies. Governments and policy-makers at various levels have shifted towards investments and surveillance of various types of job training and skills acquisitions (OECD, 2009). Active labor market programs help to bring individuals into employment, keep workers employed, optimize productivity and earnings through various means (Brown & Koettl, 2012). Further to the threat of automation and digitalization, international organizations are monitoring and estimating labor market trends considering COVID-19 and its impact on the various economies worldwide. As of September 22nd, 2020, there have been over 31 million cases and over 960,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 (John Hopkins University, 2020) with numbers still increasing daily. The consequences of this pandemic will include a significant disruption and impact on global unemployment and underemployment rates, implications for the quality of work available with reduced income, and working poverty, and worsening social inequalities and inequities as less access to social protection may also impact the quality of work done by employees (International Labor Organization, 2020). Furthermore, these critical implications can contribute to a global economic recession (UN Conference for Trade and Development, 2020). COVID-19 has led to increased demand for some occupations and shortage in specific skills as well as social displacement of workers, for example, some staff have been redeployed to new posts and newly trained healthcare professionals were introduced earlier than expected into needed posts (such as screening for COVID-19). Evidence on effects of labor market programs to reduce unemployment from previous economic crises may be applicable to the COVID-19 recovery plan. A key challenge will be to reduce unemployment by skills development and training, whether through upskilling to remain acquainted with and ensure skills match present labor market needs, or reskilling. The UN suggests that skills development programs may be a part of a policy response to COVID-19. Skills development and training is important by virtue of the outcomes they can produce at both the system, employer, and individual levels. Different interventions involving formal education, informal training, and other learning activities can contribute to technical and soft adult skills development necessary in the labor market. The types of interventions include career support, pathway guidance, assessment, funding, wraparound support (e.g., childcare, coaching), accreditation, training delivery (in-person, digital, practitioner-led training, by public or private providers; Orlik, 2018). These interventions are often provided in various combinations and may be geared toward paid employment or self-employment. They can lead to an impact at the participant level (e.g., skills, employment and retention, earnings), and at the level of the employer (e.g., retention, hire quality) and the system (e.g., diversity of workforce/equity, community well-being). Although many programs have a positive impact on participants, employers and labor market systems, some negative impacts such as reduced wages and displacement have occurred as a result of imbalance in labor demand and supply (Brown & Koettl, 2012; Crépon et al., 2013). See the conceptual framework of interventions and outcomes we developed in consultation with stakeholders who have expertise in skills development and policy (Figure 1). An evidence and gap map EGM is a decision making and research prioritization tool used to identify areas of evidence as well as gaps in research to inform social policy, program, and research priorities (Snilstveit et al., 2013). The roles of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies in economies have gained prominence among governmental and legislative policy agendas (Jansen et al., 2020). This EGM is aligned with the priorities of the Future Skills Centre (FSC), a pan-Canadian initiative, and who will be the map's primary user. FSC's mandate is to connect ideas and innovations generated across Canada so that employees and employers may thrive in the labor market, and to ensure that economies at the local, regional, and national levels flourish. Working with their partners to inform and support local approaches to skills development and employment training in ever-changing economies, FSC will use this rapid and evidence gap map to direct their future research agenda, which is time-sensitive due to the social and economic consequences of COVID-19. Similar EGMs exists with a focus on higher levels of education and skills (Winters, 2018), funding for adult skills development (Gloster et al., 2016) and youth skill development in low-middle income countries (Rankin et al., 2015). Two systematic reviews have also been conducted one on vocational and business training and women's labor market outcomes in low-and middle-income countries (Chinen et al., 2017) and the other on youth employment programs and labor market outcomes in high- and low-middle income countries (Kluve et al., 2019). Since there are existing EGMs for skills development in low- and middle-income countries and the setting for skills development is different in low-resource settings, we decided to focus on high-income country evidence for this EGM. The objective of this EGM is to identify primary studies and systematic reviews on the effects of adult skills development and training on outcomes for the jobseeker/employee, employer and labor market systems in high income countries. Define a framework. Identify the available evidence. Appraise the quality of the evidence. Extract, code, and summarize the data that relate to the objectives. Visualization and presentation of the findings in a user-friendly manner. We will use the Campbell Collaboration mapping tool developed by the EPPI-Centre (Digital Solution Foundry & EPPI-Centre, 2020) to generate and display identified studies using the framework described below. Our intervention and outcomes framework was developed and adapted from the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) and the FSC's Common Outcomes Framework (Future Skills Centre, 2019). Our 15 intervention categories are based on NESTA's nine components for an inclusive and responsive learning ecosystem (Orlik, 2018), which are highlighted as recommendations on how to plan policy for skills provision. The FSC Common Outcomes Framework is a set of measures that focus on employment-related outcomes approaches both within Canada and internationally. We held a stakeholder workshop in February 2020 with academics, economists, and community-based organizations in order to refine our interventions-outcomes framework. Workshop participants suggested a recategorization of the framework categories and filter options, and these will be used in our map. The framework will follow a standard intervention and outcomes matrix where the rows are interventions and the columns are outcomes. Figure 1 is our conceptual framework in which the inputs lead to the intended outcomes. Interventions, services, or programs are dependent upon investments from governments and or related stakeholders, as well as research. Through the skills development interventions, individuals acquire the skills and training to optimize their potential in the labor market. This conceptual framework includes skills development interventions which recognize and seek to overcome systemic barriers to equitable employment, such as lack of sufficient wrap-around support, need for culturally responsive interventions and need for commitment and activation measures from employers to ultimately support a diverse workforce and promote community well-being. We will include studies which assess the impact of interventions or programs with a component of skills development and/or training among individuals post high school age. For example, a jobs search assistance program without a skills development component will be excluded. Interventions may take place in any setting (e.g., community centre, workplace, educational institutions, etc.) in high income countries. We provide more details on our dimensions below. The EGM framework for an EGM informs the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We chose intervention and outcomes as our key dimensions. We will include primary studies and systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Level 3: outcomes are compared in intervention group before and after the intervention, and the comparison group is used to provide a counterfactual. Level 4: the intervention and control groups vary in their exposure to the random allocation of the intervention. Level 5: research designs that involve explicit randomization into intervention and control groups. For systematic reviews, we will include studies that explicitly describe the methods used to identify studies (i.e., a search strategy), strategies for study selection (e.g., eligibility criteria and selection process) and methods of synthesis or analysis (Moher et al., 2015). This study design, as defined by PRISMA, uses a transparent and an a priori methodology in order to ensure rigor. We will not exclude eligible systematic reviews with level 1 or 2 studies. We will list articles and books under studies awaiting classification if they are not available electronically due to the rapid process of this map. We do not plan to include qualitative research due to the rapid nature of the map. We will limit primary studies to high income country settings as defined by the World Bank Classifications (The World Bank, 2020). We will not exclude systematic reviews that do not report the settings. We will include all relevant on-going and completed studies. We will not search for unpublished articles. Our map will focus on adults who are post high school age in high income countries. We recognize that individuals may drop out from school and the age at which individuals complete high school may vary between countries and provinces/states. For example, the typical age for completing high school is 18–19 years in Europe and 17–18 years in North America. We will also include studies with a subset of eligible participants as some studies may include participants with overlapping age range, for example. Intervention: the intervention categories of this map, as outlined below, are adapted from the NESTA (Orlik, 2018) categorization for an inclusive and responsive skills ecosystem. Our interventions are listed and defined in Table 1. We will include studies with interventions that have a component of skills development and/or training and exclude all studies which do not have a skills development and/or training component. For example, this exclusion may include the WorkFirst program, Individual placement and support, or subsidized entrepreneurship if there is no focus on skills or training. We adapted the Common Outcomes Framework from the FSC (Future Skills Centre, 2019). The outcomes we will map are found below in Table 2. We will develop and pilot a search strategy (with a selection of suggested studies that met our inclusion criteria) with an information scientist (Douglas Salzwedel). This search will comprise social and economic databases including gray literature sources such as dissertations and conference abstracts databases. We will use the search strategy for on-going and completed studies in: ABI/INFORM via ProQuest, Canadian Business & Current Affairs Database via ProQuest, Canadian Research Index via ProQuest, EconLit via EBSCO, ERIC via ProQuest, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences via ProQuest, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, PsycINFO via Ovid, Social Services Abstracts via ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts via ProQuest, Web of Science via Clarivate (Social Sciences Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index—Social Science & Humanities), and Social Systems Evidence. See Table 3 for a full PsycInfo search strategy. We held a stakeholder meeting with FSC to invite suggestions of relevant studies and sources. We will not contact other organizations or individuals for information about unpublished or ongoing studies. We adhered to the Cochrane Rapid Review Guidance (Garritty et al., 2020) as this present map is a rapid EGM. We will use two reviewers for dual screening of at least 20% of abstracts, with conflict resolution. We will use single screening for the remaining abstracts and have a second screener to screen all excluded titles and resolve any conflicts. Title and abstracts will be screened based on intervention, study design (i.e., levels on the Maryland Scientific Methods Scale), population, year of publication, language, and not based on outcome. We will exclude studies published before 2000, level 1 or 2 studies and studies that are not in either English or French. We will use Rayyan for screening at this stage and utilize the program's text-mining function to calculate likelihood of inclusion (Ouzzani et al., 2016). For full-text screening, we will have dual screening for approximately 20% of studies, and have conflicts resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. The remaining studies will be screened by one reviewer, and a second reviewer will screen excluded studies. We will use EPPI-Reviewer to screen at the full-text stage. We will also screen the reference lists of relevant studies and systematic reviews identified. We will not contact authors of studies or reviews for missing information. Included studies will be coded by a single reviewer and we will check for consistency and agreement on ~20% of studies. Our coding categories for data extraction are based on our framework. We will also collect details important for our stakeholders such as region (i.e., Canada, United States, Europe, East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, other), setting (i.e., urban or rural), population focus for intervention (e.g., francophone, newcomers, low-income, disability or Indigenous populations), age group (i.e., 15–24, 25–54, 55–64, 65+ years), auspices (e.g., employment services, digital delivery), and sociodemographics (e.g., education, marital status). These will be included as filters in the map. We have piloted and tested the extraction form on a sample of studies and generated a draft map to discuss with our stakeholders. Refer to Table 4 for coding categories. We will appraise the methodological quality of systematic reviews with AMSTAR-2 (Shea et al., 2017) in duplicate for 20% of eligible studies. κ statistics will also be used to check agreement for each item. If the agreement is over 80%, we will proceed with single data extraction with verification by a second reviewer for the remainder of studies. The methodological quality of primary studies is not usually assessed in EGMs (Snilstveit et al., 2017). Our EGM report will include the standard sections: executive summary, background, methods, results, and conclusion. We will indicate any changes we made between the protocol and the final report. The results section will present the number of studies retrieved from our database search and provide an overview of the types of studies by intervention, outcomes, auspices and other filters used. The conclusion will provide a detailed account of policy implications for researchers and decision-makers and highlight key areas for research commissioning. Figure: Conceptual framework Figure: PRISMA flow chart Table: number of studies by study design Table: number of studies by interventions and outcomes Table: number of studies by population Other tables and figures will be included based on the coded information for other filters. We will treat multiple reports (e.g., secondary analyses or protocols) of a single study as one. Systematic reviews will likely include primary studies that are included in the map, and there may be more than one systematic review which may include the same primary study. Primary studies which meet our eligibility criteria will be included in the map regardless of whether they are included in a systematic review. The key dimensions will be interventions (presented in rows) and outcomes (presented in columns). We will use bubbles of varying sizes to present included studies. Different colors will be used for different types of studies. Final decisions about the filters will be made based on the number of included studies and coded information. The online interactive map will be hosted by FSC and Campbell. Our central team (V. W., K. G., L. M., and C. M.) will meet bi-weekly to discuss the direction and scope of the EGM. We held a stakeholder workshop on February 26th, 2020 with our advisory group to discuss our proposed intervention and outcome framework, and eligible study designs. This group of stakeholders represented perspectives from community-based organizations as well as academics and economists who work in the skills development and training sector in Canada. The advisory group will convene again in May to discuss a draft map with preliminary results. Content: L. M. M., K. and G.-M. EGM methods: C. M. and V. W.

Uncertainty about artificial intelligence technology in Russian society,2021,"Artificial intelligence (AI) already affects many areas of society today. On the one hand, it is often associated with fears around dystopian surveillance, total workplace automation, and other dangers. On the other hand, the notions that AI actively stimulates innovation and acts as a powerful tool for solving various social problems occupy a significant place in discussions. At the same time, the high level of uncertainty in relation to the latest technologies makes the question of AI’s future especially susceptible to definition and framing by certain influential social groups. In the current article, consideration of the issues of social construction of attitudes on the prospects of AI technology is explained by the relevance of the conflict shown in Russian realities between the population’s concern and ambitious legislative goal setting. Against the background of these poles of skeptical and progressive orientations, the positions of specialized scientists and business are no less interesting. They are forced to find a balance somewhere between these polarities in defending their own interests. The materials presented in the article summarize the results of previous studies, and also rely on the analysis of state documents in the field under study in order to present an overall picture of the development of technology. Based on the results of the study, directions for further deepening the sociological understanding of the processes taking place today in Russia concerning the development and implementation of artificial intelligence are identified.","['uncertainty', 'about', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'technology', 'russian', 'society']"
My Boss the Computer: A Bayesian analysis of socio-demographic and cross-cultural determinants of attitude toward the Non-Human Resource Management,2021,"Human resource management technologies have moved from biometric surveillance to emotional artificial intelligence (AI) that monitor employees' engagement and productivity, analyze video interviews and CVs of job applicants. The rise of the US$20 billion emotional AI industry will transform the future workplace. Yet, besides no international consensus on the principles or standards for such technologies, there is a lack of cross-cultural research on future job seekers' attitude toward such use of AI technologies. This study collects a cross-sectional dataset of 1,015 survey responses of international students from 48 countries and 8 regions worldwide. A majority of the respondents (52%) are concerned about being managed by AI. Following the hypothetico-deductivist philosophy of science, we use the MCMC Hamiltonian approach and conduct a detailed comparison of 10 Bayesian network models with the PSIS-LOO method. We consistently find having a higher income, being male, majoring in business, and/or self-rated familiarity with AI correlate with a more positive view of emotional AI in the workplace. There is also a stark cross-cultural and cross-regional difference. Our analysis shows people from economically less developed regions (Africa, Oceania, Central Asia) tend to exhibit less concern for AI managers. And for East Asian countries, 64% of the Japanese, 56% of the South Korean, and 42% of the Chinese professed the trusting attitude. In contrast, an overwhelming majority of 75% of the European and Northern American possesses the worrying/neutral attitude toward being managed by AI. Regarding religion, Muslim students correlate with the most concern toward emotional AI in the workplace. When religiosity is higher, the correlation becomes stronger for Muslim and Buddhist students.","['boss', 'computer:', 'bayesian', 'analysis', 'socio-demographic', 'cross-cultural', 'determinants', 'attitude', 'toward', 'non-human', 'resource', 'management']"
Contested Transparency: Digital Monitoring Technologies and Worker Voice,2023,"Advances in artificial intelligence and data analytics have notably expanded employers' monitoring and surveillance capabilities, facilitating the accurate observability of work effort. There is an ongoing debate among academics and policymakers about the productivity and broader welfare implications of digital monitoring (DM) technologies. In this context, many countries confer information, consultation and codetermination rights to employee representation (ER) bodies on matters related to the workplace governance of these technologies. Using a cross-sectional sample of more than 21000 European establishments, we document a positive association between ER and the utilization of DM technologies. We also find a positive effect of ER on DM utilization in the context of a local-randomization regression discontinuity analysis that exploits size-contingent policy rules governing the operation of ER bodies in Europe. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we find a positive association between DM and process innovations, particularly in establishments where ER bodies are present and a large fraction of workers perform jobs that require finding solutions to unfamiliar problems.

Employee surveillance, customer privacy, replacing workers with machines and programs, using new data-mining techniques in the hiring process, and more—the multilayered dilemmas these new opportunities present increasingly require managers' careful consideration and innovative leadership, for the ""future of work"" we've long predicted is rapidly becoming our present reality. Each caselet pushes managers to a nuanced and complicated consideration of human creativity, ingenuity, and need, both in tandem with and against AI's rapidity, efficiency, and precision. The caselets are short—no longer than three paragraphs. When taught together, they provide managers with a strong sense of the interconnectedness, difficulty, and urgency of the technological decisions they inevitably will have to make for the sake of their stakeholders.ExcerptUVA-E-0437Apr. 16, 2020Artificial Intelligence CaseletsUsing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to DownsizeYou are a manager at an insurance company. Based on the latest pitch from a consultancy that specializes in AI applications, you learn that you can save time and money and significantly boost productivity by replacing an entire department in your company—including every person in that department's existing workforce—with an AI system. You see clear advantages in making this change. Given the large amounts of data that your company possesses on your insured risks and their multifaceted drivers, this is a natural application for an AI system. Preliminary tests reveal the potential for large savings; and you can see that your competitors may soon adopt similar systems, putting you at a competitive disadvantage if you do not move first.However, because this strategy's risks are still largely unknown, you are concerned about being the first one in your industry to make a major move in this direction. You also are worried that your current employees will inevitably feel threatened and that this may pit them against you, each other, and the firm at large—even if only subconsciously—cancelling out the purported benefits of adopting the technology.. . .","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'caselets']"
Study of Employee Privacy Rights in the Digital Age,2025,"The digital age has brought unprecedented advancements to workplace environments, enhancing efficiency, collaboration, and connectivity. However, these technological transformations have introduced significant concerns regarding employee privacy. The widespread adoption of advanced monitoring tools, data analytics, and remote work technologies has raised questions about the balance between employers' operational needs and employees' rights to privacy. This study explores the complexities surrounding employee privacy rights in the digital era, addressing legal, ethical, and practical dimensions. It examines global legal frameworks governing workplace privacy, ethical dilemmas posed by surveillance technologies, and the role of emerging trends such as artificial intelligence and wearable technologies in employee monitoring.Through an extensive review of existing literature and analysis of real-world case studies, the research identifies critical gaps in current privacy policies and practices. Findings reveal that while monitoring technologies can enhance productivity and security, their misuse often leads to ethical challenges and a loss of trust among employees. The study underscores the importance of transparency and consent in implementing monitoring practices and highlights the lagging pace of legal regulations in addressing rapid technological advancements.To foster a balanced workplace, this study emphasizes the need for organizations to adopt ethical monitoring practices, prioritize employee awareness, and align their policies with updated legal and societal expectations. By proposing strategies that balance organizational objectives with the preservation of individual rights, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on workplace privacy. The findings aim to guide policymakers and organizations in designing frameworks that ensure technological innovation does not compromise the fundamental rights of employees, ultimately advocating for a workplace culture built on trust, fairness, and respect.","['study', 'employee', 'privacy', 'rights', 'digital']"
Algorithmic Management. Theoretical Perspectives and Implications for Organizational Development,2024,"Algorithmic management leverages data-driven algorithms and artificial intelligence to automate managerial functions traditionally executed by human managers. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of algorithmic management, exploring its definitions and emergence in gig economy platforms and traditional workplaces. It delves into key sociological and organizational theories—including Weber's bureaucracy, Critical Management Studies (CMS), and technological rationality—to frame the discussion. The impact of algorithmic management on employee autonomy, digital surveillance, and forms of worker resistance is examined, alongside its role in shaping organizational structures, enhancing efficiency, and driving innovation. Ethical implications, particularly concerning fairness, transparency, and bias, are critically analyzed. While algorithmic management offers potential benefits such as improved efficiency and decision-making, it also raises significant concerns about worker autonomy, power imbalances, and ethical considerations. The paper underscores the need for a nuanced understanding and responsible implementation of algorithmic management to harness its advantages while mitigating its drawbacks.","['algorithmic', 'management.', 'theoretical', 'perspectives', 'implications', 'organizational', 'development']"
"Using Existing CCTV Network for Crowd Management, Crime Prevention, and Work Monitoring Using AIML",2025,"This project leverages an existing CCTV network to enhance crowd management, crime prevention, and work monitoring through the integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies.

Artificial Intelligence and Labor Markets: Analyzing Job Displacement and Creation,2025,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming labour markets through automation, job displacement, and the creation of new employment opportunities. This study employs a descriptive and comparative research design to analyze AI's impact across various industries, using statistical trend analysis, comparative sector evaluations, and qualitative NVivo-style interview analysis. Findings indicate that industries such as manufacturing and retail experience high job displacement rates (45% and 35%), whereas healthcare and Education show higher AI-driven job creation (50% and 60%). A major challenge identified is the AI skills gap, where 84% of interview respondents highlighted difficulties in workforce adaptation due to the lack of AI-related training programs. The trend analysis reveals a 55% increase in AI job creation between 2015-2025, but many workers remain unprepared for these new roles. Comparative industry analysis suggests that countries and sectors investing in reskilling initiatives and AI governance policies experience lower AI-induced unemployment rates. Beyond economic concerns, this study highlights AI's psychological and social implications in the workplace, such as job insecurity, workplace surveillance, and mental health challenges. To address these issues, governments and corporations must implement AI workforce reskilling programs, fair labour policies, and ethical AI deployment strategies. The research concludes that proactive AI governance and workforce adaptation strategies are essential for ensuring an inclusive and sustainable labour market transition.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'labor', 'markets:', 'analyzing', 'displacement', 'creation']"
SS55-02 PARTICIPATION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEES AND SUPERVISORS IN THE MITIGATION OF OCCUPATIONAL RISKS DUE TO THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,2024,"Abstract Introduction The intervention of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of work has been generating a real impact that must be addressed with priority given the potential violation of the fundamental right to safety and health at work. Therefore, the intervention of committees and supervisors in management systems is relevant considering the appearance of emerging risks such as cyberbullying. Materials and Methods In 2021, a quantitative study was carried out in Peru during the state of health emergency due to COVID-19 which identified the absence of safety management in companies in the formal sector. For the study, the information recorded by the Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion for the years 2020 and 2021 is taken as a basis and the information is analysed, segmenting between micro and small companies in the formal sector. Results Among the findings, it was found that of 314,762 companies, only 66,689 complied with the implementation of workplace health and safety committees and supervisors, representing only 21% of the total companies in Peru, finding a significant relationship between the absence of committees and supervisors and the increase in complaints of cyberbullying or excessive surveillance on the part of the employer. Conclusions The intervention of health and safety committees and supervisors requires priority implementation as well as the dissemination of emerging risks due to the use of AI in the world of work.","['ss55-02', 'participation', 'health', 'safety', 'committees', 'supervisors', 'mitigation', 'occupational', 'risks', 'artificial', 'intelligence']"
Personnel Face Recognition Access and Automation System Design for University Engineering Laboratories,2022,"Security and crowd control have become a pressing concern in times of the pandemic because of health and safety reasons in populated areas.Imposed restrictions by the authorities to limit people's activities cannot be monitored with a few security personnel such as in schools and universities.Current CCTV systems can monitor and record activities in crowded premises but may not be able to control entry and exit in the school or universities.Face recognition technology is applied in this research for keyless automated laboratory access to monitor personnel activity using security IP cameras and control laboratory occupants.The algorithm of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for face detection using Emgu CV libraries in a computer provided additional relevant functionalities to the existing security IP cameras when connected to the PC.The studied system has fast non-contact automated door access with minimal user interaction and is programmed to include an attendance system for personnel.It also provided automated ventilation and lighting in the laboratory rooms for efficient energy utilization and provisions for alarm when a crowd is detected.The system provided an added level of security for populated premises such as schools or universities in as much as population safety and crowd monitoring is required.When two or more faces are adjacent and detected, the crowd control is triggered with a message to observe minimum social distancing.The implemented system showed detection reliability of up to 96.67% using Machine learning technology.Results showed significant added functionality to the CCTV security system.Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence in biometrics improved the reliability of fast and efficient facial recognition authentication, automation and security surveillance systems.The smart door for restricted environments significantly increases the safety of workplaces and schools when implemented with IoT devices such as Arduino and digital IP cameras.","['personnel', 'face', 'recognition', 'access', 'automation', 'system', 'design', 'university', 'engineering', 'laboratories']"
"Embracing Liminality and ""Staying with the Trouble"" on (and off) Screen",2021,"Setting the Mood Weirdly, everything feels the same. There’s absolutely no distinction for me between news, work, walking, gaming, Netflix, rock collecting, scrolling, messaging. I don’t know how this happened, but everything has simply blurred together. There’s a dreadful and yet soothing sameness to it, scrolling through images on Instagram, scrolling Netflix, walking the dog, scrolling the news, time scrolling by as I watch face after face appear or disappear on my screen, all saying something, yet saying nothing. Is this the rhythm of crisis in a slow apocalypse? Really, would it be possible for humans to just bore themselves into oblivion? Because in the middle of a pandemic, boredom feels in my body the same as doom ... just another swell that passes, like my chest as it rises and falls with my breath. This opening anecdote comes from combining narratives in two studies we conducted online during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020: a global study, Massive and Microscopic Sensemaking: Autoethnographic Accounts of Lived Experience in Times of Global Trauma; and an Australian project, The Shut-In Worker: Working from Home and Digitally-Enabled Labour Practices. The Shut-In Worker project aimed to investigate the thoughts, beliefs, and experiences of Australian knowledge workers working from home during lockdown. From June to October 2020, we recruited twelve households across two Australian states. While the sample included households with diverse incomes and living arrangements—from metropolitan single person apartment dwellers to regional families in free standing households—the majority were relatively privileged. The households included in this study were predominantly Anglo-Australian and highly educated. Critically, unlike many during COVID-19, these householders had maintained their salaried work. Participating households took part in an initial interview via Zoom or Microsoft Teams during which they took us on workplace tours, showing us where and how the domestic had been requisitioned for salaried labour. Householders subsequently kept digital diaries of their working days ahead of follow up interviews in which we got them to reflect on their past few weeks working from home with reference to the textual and photographic diaries they had shared with us. In contrast to the tight geographic focus of The Shut-In Worker project and its fairly conventional methodology, the Massive and Microscopic Sensemaking project was envisaged as a global project and driven by an experimental participant-led approach. Involving more than 150 people from 26 countries during 2020, the project was grounded in autoethnography practice and critical pedagogy. Over 21 days, we offered self-guided prompts for ourselves and the other participants—a wide range of creative practitioners, scholar activists, and researchers—to explore their own lived experience. Participants with varying degrees of experience with qualitative methods and/or autoethnography started working with the research questions we had posed in our call; some independently, some in collaboration. The autoethnographic lens used in our study encouraged contributors to document their experience from and through their bodies, their situated daily routines, and their relations with embedded, embodied, and ubiquitous digital technologies. The lens enabled deep exploration and evocation of many of the complexities, profound paradoxes, fears, and hopes that characterise the human and machinic entanglements that bring us together and separate the planetary “us” in this moment (Markham et al. 2020). In this essay we draw on anecdotes and narratives from both studies that speak to the “Zoom experience” during COVID-19. That is, we use Zoom as a socio-technical pivot point to think about how the experience of liminality—of being on/off screen and ambiently in between—is operating to shift both our micro practices and macro structures as we experience and struggle within the rupture, “event”, and conjuncture that marks the global pandemic. What we will see is that many of those narratives depict disjointed, blurry, or confusing experiences, atmospheres, and affects. These liminal experiences are entangled in complex ways with the distinctive forms of commercial infrastructure and software that scaffold video conferencing platforms such as Zoom. Part of what is both enabling and troubling about the key proprietary platforms that increasingly host “public” participation and conversation online (and that came to play a dominant role during COVID19) in the context of what Tarleton Gillespie calls “the internet of platforms” is a sense of the hidden logics behind such platforms. The constant sense of potential dis/connection—with home computers becoming ambient portals to external others—also saw a wider experience of boundarylessness evoked by participants. Across our studies there was a sense of a complete breakdown between many pre-existing boundaries (or at least dotted lines) around work, school, play, leisure and fitness, public and media engagement, and home life. At the same time, the vocabulary of confinement and lockdown emerged from the imposition of physical boundaries or distancing between the self and others, between home and the outside world. During the “connected confinement” of COVID-19, study participants commonly expressed an affective sensation of dysphoria, with this new state of in betweenness or disorientation on and off screen, in and out of Zoom meetings, that characterises the COVID-19 experience seen by many as a temporary, unpleasant disruption to sociality as usual. Our contention is that, as disturbing as many of our experiences are and have been during lockdown, there is an important, ethically and politically generative dimension to our global experiences of liminality, and we should hold on to this state of de-normalisation. Much ink has been spilled on the generalised, global experience of videoconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A line of argument within this commentary speaks to the mental challenge and exhaustion—or zoom fatigue as it is now popularly termed—that many have been experiencing in attempting to work, learn, and live collectively via interactive screen technologies. We suggest zoom fatigue stands in for a much larger set of global social challenges—a complex conjuncture of microscopic ruptures, decisions within many critical junctures or turning points, and slow shifts in how we see and make sense of the world around us. If culture is habit writ large, what should we make of the new habits we are building, or the revelations that our prior ways of being in the world might not suit our present planetary needs, and maybe never did? Thus, we counter the current dominant narrative that people, regions, and countries should move on, pivot, or do whatever else it takes to transition to a “new normal”. Instead, drawing on the work of Haraway and others interested in more than human, post-anthropocenic thinking about the future, this essay contends that—on a dying planet facing major global challenges—we need to be embracing liminality and “staying with the trouble” if we are to hope to work together to imagine and create better worlds. This is not necessarily an easy step but we explore liminality and the affective components of Zoom fatigue here to challenge the assumption that stability and certainty is what we now need as a global community. If the comfort experienced by a chosen few in pre-COVID-19 times was bought at the cost of many “others” (human and more than human), how can we use the discomfort of liminality to imagine global futures that have radically transformative possibilities? On Liminality Because liminality is deeply affective and experienced both individually and collectively, it is a difficult feeling or state to put into words, much less generalised terms. It marks the uncanny or unstable experience of existing between. Being in a liminal state is marked by a profound disruption of one’s sense of self, one’s phenomenological being in the world, and in relation to others. Zoom, in and of itself, provokes a liminal experience. As this participant says: Zoom is so disorienting. I mean this literally; in that I cannot find a solid orientation toward other people. What’s worse is that I realize everyone has a different view, so we can’t even be sure of what other people might be seeing on their screen. In a real room this would not be an issue at all. The concept of liminality originally came out of attempts to capture the sense of flux and transition, rather than stasis, that shapes culture and community, exemplified during rites of passage. First developed in the early twentieth century by ethnographer and folklorist Arnold van Gennep, it was later taken up and expanded upon by British anthropologist Victor Turner. Turner, best known for his work on cultural rituals and rites of passage, describes liminality as the sense of “in betweenness” experienced as one moves from one status (say that of a child) to another (formal recognition of adulthood). For Turner, community life and the formation of societies more broadly involves periods of transition, threshold moments in which both structures and anti-structures become apparent. Bringing liminality into the contemporary digital moment, Zizi Papacharissi discusses the concept in collective terms as pertaining to the affective states of networked publics, particularly visible in the development of new social and political formations through wide scale social media responses to the Arab Spring. Liminality in this context describes the “not yet”, a state of “pre-emergence” or “emergence” of unformed potentiality. In this usage, Papacharissi builds on Turner’s description of liminality as “a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise” (97). The pandemic has sparked another moment of liminality. Here, we conceptualise liminality as a continuous dialectical process of being pushed and pulled in various directions, which does not necessarily resolve into a stable state or position. Shifting one’s entire lifeworld into and onto computer screens and the micro screens of Zoom, as experienced by many around the world, collapses the usual functioning norms that maintain some degree of distinction between the social, intimate, political, and work spheres of everyday life. But this shift also creates new boundaries and new rules of engagement. As a result, people in our studies often talked about experiencing competing realities about “where” they are, and/or a feeling of being tugged by contradictory or competing forces that, because they cannot be easily resolved, keep us in an unsettled, uncomfortable state of being in the world. Here the dysphoric experiences associated not just with digital liminality but with the broader COVID-19 epidemiological-socio-political conjuncture are illustrated by Sianne Ngai’s work on the politics of affect and “ugly feelings” in the context of capitalism’s relentlessly affirmative culture. Rather than dismissing the vague feelings of unease that, for many of us, go hand in hand with late modern life, Ngai suggests that such generalised and dispersed affective states are important markers of and guides to the big social and cultural problems of our time—the injustices, inequalities, and alienating effects of late capitalism. While critical attention tends to be paid to more powerful emotions such as anger and fear, Ngai argues that softer and more nebulous forms of negative affect—from envy and anxiety to paranoia—can tell us much about the structures, institutions, and practices that frame social action. These enabling and constraining processes occur at different and intersecting levels. At the micro level of the screen interface, jarring experiences can set us to wondering about where we are (on or off screen, in place and space), how we appear to others, and whether or not we should showcase and highlight our “presence”. We have been struck by how people in our studies expressed the sense of being handled or managed by the interfaces of Zoom or Microsoft Teams, which frame people in grid layouts, yet can shift and alter these frames in unanticipated ways. I hate Zoom. Everything about it. Sometimes I see a giant person, shoved to the front of the meeting in “speaker view” to appear larger than anyone else on the screen. People constantly appear and disappear, popping in and out. Sometimes, Zoom just rearranges people seemingly randomly. People commonly experience themselves or others being resized, frozen, or “glitched”, muted, accidentally unmuted, suddenly disconnected, or relegated to the second or third “page” of attendees. Those of us who attend many meetings as a part of work or education may enjoy the anonymity of appearing at a meeting without our faces or bodies, only appearing to others as a nearly blank square or circle, perhaps with a notation of our name and whether or not we are muted. Being on the third page of participants means we are out of sight, for better or worse. For some, being less visible is a choice, even a tactic. For others, it is not a choice, but based on lack of access to a fast or stable Internet connection. The experience and impact of these micro elements of presence within the digital moment differs, depending on where you appear to others in the interface, how much power you have over the shape or flow of the interaction or interface settings, or what your role is. Moving beyond the experience of the interface and turning to the middle range between micro and macro worlds, participants speak of attempting to manage blurred or completely collapsed boundaries between “here” and “there”. Being neither completely at work or school nor completely at home means finding new ways of negotiating the intimate and the formal, the domestic and the public. This delineation is for many not a matter of carving out specific times or spaces for each, but rather a process of shifting back and forth between makeshift boundaries that may be temporal or spatial, depending on various aspects of one’s situation. Many of us most likely could see the traces of this continuous shifting back and forth via what Susan Leigh Star called “boundary objects”. While she may not have intended this concept in such concrete terms, we could see these literally, in the often humorous but significantly disruptive introduction of various domestic actants during school or work, such as pets, children, partners, laundry baskets, beds, distinctive home decor, ambient noise, etc. Other trends highlight the difficulty of maintaining zones of work and school when these overlap with the rest of the physical household. One might place Post-it Notes on the kitchen wall saying “I’m in a Zoom meeting so don’t come into the living room” or blur one’s screen background to obscure one’s domestic location. These are all strategies of maintaining ontological security in an otherwise chaotic process of being both here and there, and neither here nor there. Yet even with these strategies, there is a constant dialectical liminality at play. In none of these examples do participants feel like they are either at home or at work; instead, they are constantly shifting in between, trying to balance, or straddling physical and virtual, public and private, in terms of social “roles” and “locations”. These negotiations highlight the “ongoingness” of and the labour involved in maintaining some semblance of balance within what is inherently an unbalanced dialectical process. Participants talked about and showed in their diaries and pictures developed for the research projects the ways they act through, work with, or sometimes just try to ignore these opposing states. The rise of home-based videoconferencing and associated boundary management practices have also highlighted what has been marginalised or forgotten and conversely, prioritised or valorised in prior sociotechnical assemblages that were simply taken for granted. Take for example the everyday practices of being in a work versus domestic lifeworld; deciding how to handle the labor of cleaning cups and dishes used by the “employees” and “students” in the family throughout the day, the tasks of enforcing school attendance by children attending classes in the family home etc. This increased consciousness—at both a household and more public level—of a previously often invisible and feminised care economy speaks to larger questions raised by the lockdown experience. At the same time as people in our studies were negotiating the glitches of screen presence and the weird boundarylessness of home-leisure-domestic-school-work life, many expressed an awareness of a troubling bigger picture. First, we had just the COVID lockdowns, you know, that time where many of us were seemingly “all together” in this, at home watching Tiger King, putting neighborly messages in our windows, or sharing sourdough recipes on social media. Then Black Lives Matters movements happened. Suddenly attention is shifted to the fact that we’re not all in this together. In Melbourne, people in social housing towers got abruptly locked down without even the chance to go to the store for food first, and yet somehow the wealthy or celebrity types are not under this heavy surveillance; they can just skip the mandatory quarantine. ... We can’t just go on with things as usual ... there are so many considerations now. Narratives like these suggest that while 2020 might have begun with the pandemic, the year raised multiple other issues. As many things have been destabilised, the nature or practice of everyday life is shifting under our feet. Around the world, people are learning how to remain more distanced from each other, and the rhythms of temporal and geographic movement are adapting to an era of the pandemic. Simultaneously, many people talk about an endlessly arriving (but never quite here) moment when things will be back to normal, implying not only that this feeling of uncertainty will fade, but also that the zone of comfort is in what was known and experienced previously, rather than in a state of something radically different. This sentiment is strong despite the general agreement that “we will never [be able to] go back to how it was, but [must] proceed to some ‘new normal’”. Still, as the participant above suggests, the pandemic has also offered a much broader challenge to wider, taken-for-granted social, political, and economic structures that underpin late capitalist nations in particular. The question then becomes: How do we imagine “moving on” from the pandemic, while learning from the disruptive yet critical moment it has offered us as a global community? Learning from Liminality I don’t want us to go back to “normal”, if that means we are just all commuting in our carbon spitting cars to work and back or traveling endlessly and without a care for the planet. COVID has made my life better. Not having to drive an hour each way to work every day—that’s a massive benefit. While it’s been a struggle, the tradeoff is spending more time with loved ones—it’s a better quality of life, we have to rethink the place of work. I can’t believe how much more I’ve been involved in huge discussions about politics and society and the planet. None of this would have been on my radar pre-COVID. What would it mean then to live with as well as learn from the reflexive sense of being and experience associated with the dis-comforts of living on and off screen, a Zoom liminality, if you will? These statements from participants speak precisely to the budding consciousness of new potential ways of being in a post-COVID-19 world. They come from a place of discomfort and represent dialectic tensions that perhaps should not be shrugged off or too easily resolved. Indeed, how might we consider this as the preferred state, rather than being simply a “rite of passage” that implies some pathway toward more stable identities and structured ways of being? The varied concepts of “becoming”, “not quite yet”, “boundary work”, or “staying with the trouble”, elaborated by Karen Barad, Andrew Pickering, Susan Leigh Star, and Donna Haraway respectively, all point to ways of being, acting, and thinking through and with liminality. All these thinkers are linked by their championing of murky and mangled conceptions of experience and more than human relations. Challenging notions of the bounded individual of rational humanism, these post-human scholars offer an often-uncomfortable picture of being in and through multiplicity, of modes of agency born out of a slippage between the one and the many. While, as we noted above, this experience of in betweenness and entanglement is often linked to emotions we perceive as negative, “ugly feelings”, for Barad et al., such liminal moments offer fundamentally productive and experimental modalities that enable possibilities for new configurations of being and doing the social in the anthropocene. Further, liminality as a concept potentially becomes radically progressive when it is seen as both critically appraising the constructed and conventional nature of prior patterns of living and offering a range of reflexive alternatives. People in our studies spoke of the pandemic moment as offering tantalizing glimpses of what kinder, more caring, and egalitarian futures might look like. At the same time, many were also surprised by (and skeptical of) the banality and randomness of the rise of commercial platforms like Zoom as a “choice” for being with others in this current lifeworld, emerging as it did as an ad hoc, quick solution that met the demands of the moment. Zoom fatigue then also suggests a discomfort about somehow being expected to fully incorporate proprietary platforms like Zoom and their algorithmic logics as a core way of living and being in the post-COVID-19 world. In this sense the fact that a specific platform has become a branded eponym for the experience of online public communicative fatigue is telling indeed. The unease around the centrality of video conferencing to everyday life during COVID-19 can in part be seen as a marker of anxieties about the growing role of decentralized, private platforms in “replacing or merging with public infrastructure, [thereby] creating new social effects” (Lee). Further, jokes and off-hand comments by study participants about their messy domestic interiors being publicized via social media or their boss monitoring when they are on and offline speak to larger concerns around surveillance and privacy in online spaces, particularly communicative environments where unregulated private platforms rather than public infrastructures are becoming the default norm. But just as people are both accepting of and troubled by a growing sense of inevitability about Zoom, we also saw them experimenting with a range of other ways of being with others, from online cocktail parties to experimenting with more playful and creative apps and platforms. What these participants have shown us is the need to “stay with the trouble” or remain in this liminal space as long as possible. While we do not have the space to discuss this possibility in this short provocation, Haraway sees this experimental mode of being as involving multiple actants, human and nonhuman, and as constituting important work in terms of speculating and figuring with various “what if” scenarios to generate new possible futures. As Haraway puts it, this process of speculative figuring is one of giving and receiving patterns, dropping threads, and so mostly failing but sometimes finding something that works, something consequential and maybe even beautiful, that wasn’t there before, of relaying connections that matter, of telling stories in hand upon hand, digit upon digit, attachment site upon attachment site, to craft conditions for flourishing in terran worlding. This struggle of course takes us far beyond decisions about Zoom, specifically. This deliberately troubling liminality is a process of recognizing old habits, building new ones, doing the hard work of reconsidering broader social formations in a future that promises more trouble. Governments, institutions, corporate entities, and even social movements like Transition Towns or #BuildBackBetter all seem to be calling for getting out of this liminal zone, whether this is to “bounce back” by returning to hyper-consumerist, wasteful, profit-driven modes of life or the opposite, to “bounce forward” to radically rethink globalization and build intensely localized personal and social formations. Perhaps a third alternative is to embrace this very transitional experience itself and consider whether life on a troubled, perhaps dying planet might require our discomfort, unease, and in-betweenness, including acknowledging and sometimes embracing “glitches” and failures (Nunes). Transitionality, or more broadly liminality, has the potential to enhance our understanding of who and what “we” are, or perhaps more crucially who “we” might become, by encompassing a kind of dialectic in relation to the experiences of others, both intimate and distant. As many critical commentators before us have suggested, this necessarily involves working in conjunction with a rich ecology of planetary agents from First People’s actors and knowledge systems--a range of social agents who already know what it is to be liminal to landscapes and other species--through and with the enabling affordances of digital technologies. This is an important, and exhausting, process of change. And perhaps this trouble is something to hang on to as long as possible, as it preoccupies us with wondering about what is happening in the lines between our faces, the lines of the technologies underpinning our interactions, the taken for granted structures on and off screen that have been visibilized. We are fatigued, not by the time we spend online, although there is that, too, but by the recognition that the world is changing. References Barad, Karen.

The Future of Work is Ours,2018,"Unifor recently held a one-day conference on Automation, New Technology and the Future of Work. As part of this event, the union released a discussion paper called The Future of Work is Ours: Confronting risks and seizing opportunities of technological change. With 315,000 members across the country in almost every sector of the economy, Unifor is Canada’s largest private-sector union. The union’s response to technological change is very much a work in progress, and the conference and discussion paper serve as a starting point in this process. The fundamental question at hand: how do we develop a worker-led program allowing us to get the best of technological change while avoiding the worst? We know that working people in Canada and around the world have been experiencing the negative impacts of technological change, and are feeling threatened and afraid for their own futures. At the same time, we have seen incredible opportunities for new and better jobs, union growth, and advancements in workplace health and safety due to technological change. Our responsibility as workers and as a union is to take control of this conversation and move from a position of fear and defence to a position of power and action. Making the transition means first understanding the problem, and a portion of our discussion paper and day-long conference focused on deepening our understanding of exactly what we’re talking about when we discuss technological change at work. Of course, our members know that technological change is nothing new. We have always experienced the effects of technological change, from the invention of the printing press, to the Industrial Revolution, to the invention of the modern computer. But what is new is the speed of that change. In just a generation, we’ve seen the invention of the internet and artificial intelligence, so-called ‘big data’ and the advent of mass surveillance, and the widespread use of advanced robotics and other automation. A flurry of negative headlines have made wild claims about the coming ‘robot apocalypse’, where millions of jobs would be replaced by automation. However, more recently we have seen a more nuanced analysis emerge. This revised analysis focuses on the difference between a task and a job. A task is a discrete segment of work done as part of a worker’s duties of employment, while a job is a bundle of tasks assigned to a worker who performs those tasks and exchanges their labour for pay. A recent report from McKinsey Global Institute estimates that fewer than 5 percent of existing occupations are candidates for full automation. Frequently, rather than completely eliminating jobs, automation and artificial intelligence will replace some tasks, requiring workers to adjust their level of skills and knowledge used in the workplace. In terms of the Canadian context, four separate think tanks estimated the share of tasks susceptible to automation in Canada as ranging between 35 percent and 47 percent. This is across all sectors of our economy. Understanding the Impacts Part of the challenge we identified was how to create an analysis that allows our members to engage in a meaningful way. We created a framework that identifies six general areas of impact – both positive and negative – to make this issue more digestible. The first, and probably most obvious, impact is job loss or displacement, and job estrangement. Job loss or displacement is what most of us think of when we consider tech change at work – ‘I was fired from work and replaced by a robot’. But as we’ve seen, the situation is more complex, and often less dire, than that. Less obvious is what we’ve called job estrangement, where a worker’s role in her workplace changes due to technological change, leaving her feeling alienated from her work, where her skill and knowledge are no longer valued. The second major category of impact is changes in work organisation and required skills. These are impacts that many of us have experienced already. We’ve probably all heard about, and perhaps even participated in ‘up-skilling’, when workers displaced by technological change upgrade their skills to fill new roles that complement and support new technologies. But the...","['future', 'work', 'ours']"
Poverty Lawgorithms: A Poverty Lawyer’s Guide to Fighting Automated Decision-Making Harms on Low-Income Communities,2020,"We live in a “datafied” society in which our personal data is constantly harvested, analyzed, and sold by governments and businesses. Algorithms analyze this data, sort people into categories, and serve as gatekeepers to life’s necessities. Yet people remain largely in the dark about these big data systems, creating an informational asymmetry whose harmful consequences fall most harshly on low-income people. Data-centric technologies add scope, scale, and speed to negative inferences about poor people. Based on their digital profiles, they can find themselves excluded from mainstream opportunities, such as jobs, education, and housing; targeted for predatory services and products; and surveilled by systems in their neighborhoods, workplaces, and schools. The technological systems impacting low-income communities raise profound issues of civil rights, human rights, and economic justice.

As a result, civil legal services (or poverty) lawyers increasingly represent clients whose legal challenges are intertwined with automated decision-making systems, digital profiling, predictive analytics, and various artificial intelligence tools. Competent legal representation requires an ability to issue-spot the ways in which data-centric technologies intersect with legal claims and defenses and to understand governing legal frameworks. At the same time, lawyers do not need the technical expertise of computer scientists to effectively interrogate these systems. Rather, understanding where and how data-centric technologies operate puts lawyers in a powerful position to advocate alongside their clients.

This report is designed to help poverty lawyers and their clients resist the adverse impacts of data-centric technologies and to engage as stakeholders in the adoption and implementation of algorithmic systems. The report is organized by major practice area and includes links to helpful resources for deeper dives into specific issues that may arise in legal services representation and policy advocacy. The practice areas covered are consumer, family law, housing, public benefits, schools and education, and workers’ rights, as well as a final section on how immigration surveillance intersects with these practice areas.","['poverty', 'lawgorithms:', 'poverty', 'lawyer’s', 'guide', 'fighting', 'automated', 'decision-making', 'harms', 'low-income', 'communities']"
Understanding Sexual and Gender Minority Privacy,2022,"This panel presentation is a summary update of the recent research from the 2021 ALISE Research Grant Competition Award: Educating for Equity?: Sexual and Gender Minority Privacy in Library and Information Studies Education. This session aligns with the conference theme, “Go back and Get It: From One Narrative to Many” by illustrating the ways in which “privacy” is a polysemous concept, and information professionals grappling with privacy from a policy perspective must be prepared for its multi-faceted nature and the distinct privacy needs of different communities. &#x0D; New library and information professionals are expected to uphold a number of ethical principles, often in contexts of incredible complexity, wherein principles may well be in conflict with one another. One of the major tools by which organizations may navigate such conflicts is policy. Indeed, “[f]or current and future information professionals to be truly prepared for the far-reaching impacts of policy on their careers and their institutions, LIS educators need to make a commitment to teaching information policy” (Jaeger et al., 2015, p. 175). That education should approach information policy in a holistic manner, as “an interrelated set of issues that comprise a larger entity” (Jaeger et al., 2015, p. 175), rather than a discrete set of issues such as privacy and intellectual freedom. Educating students in information policy becomes even more urgent when one considers how much of the ecosystem in which users participate through libraries and other information institutions is outside of the direct control of the institution itself, mediated by contracts and policies. &#x0D; In order to explore this larger question of information policy education for LIS students, this project proposed to examine a specific case: library policy addressing the privacy of sexual and gender minority (SGM) people (also often referred to by some variation of LGBTQI2SA+ people). This case sits at the confluence of several areas of discrete policy concern within LIS, including diversity, equity, and inclusion, equal access to information, privacy, and intellectual freedom. Therefore, this project provides a good opportunity to explore if and how LIS students are being equipped to deal with policy questions as “an interrelated set of issues.” This is also a case of incredible urgency, as COVID-19 has deepened existing inequities facing sexual and gender minority people in the United States. &#x0D; This project examined whether students are equipped to handle complex questions of information policy by examining the urgent information problem facing libraries: the privacy of SGM individuals in the face of COVID-19 surveillance. Sexual and gender minorities face significant information risks that differ from those of cis-gender, heterosexual people; improper information disclosure can lead to the loss of employment, housing, access to health care, and social support for SGM due to outing. Because of the risks of outing and discrimination, privacy concerns are of special concern to LGBTQ+ people in the face of pandemic surveillance, particularly digital surveillance. While privacy rights have been a point of controversy and uncertainty for all in the face of digital surveillance and the exigencies of the pandemic, sexual and gender minorities may well struggle to assert even those rights to which they are unquestionably entitled. However, even those who choose to advocate for their communities and assert their rights often do not realize that libraries are a potential place of risk. This study asked, “Are LIS programs preparing their students to meet the needs of LGBTQ+ patrons and stakeholders from a policy perspective in the workplace?” We have answered that question through a mixed-methods study, including a survey of LIS faculty, a content analysis of ALA-approved masters programs’ learning outcomes and syllabi, a document analysis of the privacy policies of a purposive sample of libraries, and interviews with library employers. The panel will share the insights gained from this study in order to expand the understanding of the privacy of marginalized groups within libraries, and provide direction for future research into information policy education within LIS. &#x0D; The panel will also discuss how this research has led to collaborations with other colleagues which focuses on human-centered digital privacy solutions for digital and social media. The burgeoning growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions, the ubiquity of social media and digital repositories, and cross-platform data usage have raised the stakes of addressing digital privacy. The enormity of data presents an uphill task to identify and mitigate private information on digital and social media platforms. Lastly, through engagement with participants, probing questions will be asked of the audience to brainstorm and collect ideas. Panel attendees will be active participants, working with the panelists in breakout groups, considering how find privacy solutions that are responsive to the legal and regulatory, social, cultural, and technical dimensions that we encounter within LIS education and beyond.","['understanding', 'sexual', 'gender', 'minority', 'privacy']"

Climate emergency and decent work,2024,"The climate crisis and loss of biodiversity, two closely related threats to human and planetary health, meet the criteria for the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an international public health emergency, as occurred with COVID-19 (1), and urged by numerous scientific journals (2). Attaining decent work, understood as “opportunities for women and men to work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity” (3), in the context of the climate emergency, creates a paradox for worker health. Outdoor workers (notably those in agriculture and construction), many of them informal workers, are among the populations most vulnerable to climate-related hazards. Simultaneously, they are inevitably at risk of exposure due to their role in maintaining the economy and functioning of society. A similar situation happened during the pandemic with essential workers (4). The WHO declaration of a public health emergency helped manage that global crisis. A consequence of the industrial revolution The current climate crisis is a direct consequence of the Industrial Revolution where key processes emerged to explain the current situation: the appearance of wage labor and the working class, with consumerism as a basic economic driver, and the exploitation of natural resources – especially fossil fuels – in their own territories and in the colonies. The extension of this capitalist model of society to virtually the entire planet is a reality. Now, we see how this economic system has brought both great harm and significant benefits. Since its beginning, capitalism has wrought great suffering for people, masterfully described, among others, by Fredrich Engels in the Manchester of 1845 (5) or the London of 1838 in Charles Dickens` Oliver Twist (6). Although working conditions have since improved in many countries, there are still unbearable examples worldwide of worker exploitation and suffering. Among them, child labor, where 70% are working in agriculture (7) or some underregulated platform work (8), in a context of ever-increasing social inequalities (9). On the other hand, due to improved working and life conditions, there has also been an extraordinary increase in the world population, from one billion at the beginning of the 19th century to approximately eight billion today, leading to a linear increase in life expectancy at birth, which doubled globally between the beginning of the 20th century and the present. In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Planetary Health (10) pointed out that never before has humanity faced such an unintended paradox. While human well-being has been improving, the planet has been degrading. A contradiction that can no longer be sustained. We have lived as if our planet`s resources are unlimited. Based on comparisons to average temperature readings of the planet between 1850 and 1900, the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change estimated in its latest report that temperatures increased by 1.1° C between 2011 and 2020. This increase is very close to the 1.5° C established by the 2015 Paris Agreement as the limit beyond which climate impacts may become irreversible. Beyond any reasonable doubt, this is mostly attributable to the greenhouse effect produced by CO2 emissions, a consequence mainly of human activity and our way of living initiated by the Industrial Revolution. This global increase in temperature, with heat waves, floods and other extreme temperature events as its most obvious manifestations, is already having effects on worker health (12, 13). Climate change is also having effects on the economy and the labor market, both in the primary (agriculture and fishing) and services (tourism) sectors, with reductions in productivity and employment. Estimates from the European Commission reveal an average loss of 3% of GDP among EU countries between 1980 and 2020 (14). Simultaneously, we should not forget that the capitalist society that emerged from the Industrial Revolution is based, among other pillars, on full or near full employment. As such, wages represent the main economic resource for the majority of people, in addition to being the primary source of wealth generation for society, on whose income and taxes the welfare state was built. Of course, employment means much more than wage earning, as it plays a fundamental role in the social processes that sustain human dignity and social cohesion (15). However, only approximately 50% of the employed population, mainly in high-income countries, enjoy decent employment with a living wage and social rights (16). The resulting Gordian knot before us is enormous, with humanity facing the climate emergency and trying to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, while simultaneously seeking to maintain and increase decent employment for all Earth`s inhabitants, boosting the welfare states at the same time (17). Controlling climate-related hazards and just green transition The alternatives proposed to escape this crossroads vary between those that propose a new paradigm, which radically changes the current economic model, betting on measures that break drastically from the capitalist economy (18), versus a gradual process, supported by mitigation, adaptation, and compensation policies (19). Favoring this second alternative, but without ruling out the need to profoundly change human consumption patterns with important repercussions on the productive system (energy, transportation, food, etc.), gradualist policies will also directly or indirectly impact employment and working conditions during the transition from carbon emission energy to green energy. To cope with this urgent situation, specific control measures have been proposed over the last few decades. Schulte and colleagues have systematically reviewed the literature (20, 21, 22), identifying new and exacerbated old climate-related hazards such as extreme temperatures, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, natural disasters, biological hazards, indoor air quality, etc., and they also assessed the impact of employment transition and economic burden on occupational health equity and mental health. On this basis, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has elaborated recommendations to mitigate and control the impact of several climate-related hazards on worker health and well-being (23). Similarly, the EU Agency for Safety and Health at Work has published guidelines for heat at work (24). Going further, some governments, such as Spain, have begun regulating and enforcing specific measures (25). Implementation of these workplace preventive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change is the responsibility of employers, with full participation of workers. Devoting resources to hazard recognition; performing risk assessments to identify which workers are most vulnerable to climate change-related hazards; and implementing a control strategy with policies, procedures, equipment, and work organization changes aiming to eliminate or minimize the impact of these hazards can improve employer preparedness (26). Adaptation policies to reduce emissions of CO2 and other gases that are driving the greenhouse effect, still with limited results, could mean a loss of six million jobs worldwide, according to estimates of the International Labor Organization (ILO) (27). This same estimation predicts a promising creation of 24 million jobs, mainly in economies emphasizing recycling and reutilization of manufactured products (the so-called “circular economy”), infrastructure construction, development of renewables and energy efficiency. Also, during this transition, new forms of work will emerge (e.g., human-robot interfaces and artificial intelligence), and with them the need to train workers, both new and existing, to adapt to those new forms of work. While waiting for positive results from mitigation and adaptation policies, a just transition to a green economy must simultaneously incorporate compensation policies. To achieve this, it is essential to strengthen social protection systems, a cornerstone of decent employment. For example, there were measures adopted during the pandemic, such as temporary employment regulation for employees or benefits covering the cessation of activity of the self-employed. Similar compensation measures may help workers affected by mitigation and adaptation policies during a transition phase, possibly to a lesser degree than in the pandemic, but lasting longer. In summary, as was the case in the most recent public health emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring the climate emergency as an international public health emergency by the WHO could play a critical role in managing this new global health crisis. Research programs, supported by global occupational health surveillance systems, to monitor the effectiveness of mitigation, adaptation and compensation measures are urgent.

Thinking out loud: how science faces crises,2021,"At this point in time the coronavirus pandemic needs no introduction, as its deadly march has troubled the world and our lives beyond anything imaginable for the vast majority. The vaccination campaign now gives a glimpse of hope towards the end of the nightmare and a possible return to normality (whatever that might mean), with the risk of being too optimistic considering the emergence of new and even more contagious variants of this virus. Even if we reach the end, there will definitely be a lot to scrutinize and learn about the role science has taken during such a difficult and unprecedented experience.To begin with, an extraordinary acceleration of the required times for biomedical research and biotechnological development has occurred. This is easy to realize if we compare the current pandemic with one of the few precedents that can be found1: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was first observed in 1981, followed by the isolation of its causative agent, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in 1983 and the first blood test approved by the FDA in 198523. This means that approximately 4 years were necessary just to identify and be able to diagnose what at that time was a new human disease. Two more years would be needed (1987) for the first treatment to emerge23. In a very different scenario, it took the scientific community less than a month to go from the first puzzling cases of pneumonia in Wuhan (China) during December 2019 to the isolation of the COVID-19-causing agent and the development of a diagnostic method1. Furthermore, as early as December 2020, the United Kingdom began with the vaccination process, soon to be followed by many other countries. It took science less than a year to go from the first reports on the clinical features of the new infection to the publication of phase III results of a vaccine45.Without any doubt, this high-speed research and development was possible due to the incommensurable body of scientific knowledge accumulated during the past decades, complemented by the quite widespread willingness of the scientific community to share preliminary results and experimental tools, the availability of well-established preprint servers, plus some particular features of this new virus (low mutation rate for an RNA virus, similarity with previous coronavirus infections) and the amount of attention and investment COVID-19-related research has received6. What comes across as relatively certain is that, at a technical level, science has outdone itself like never before (at least in this kind of situation and, of course, to the best of our knowledge). It seems that even the scientific community was astonished by its own capabilities, seeing how a variety of well-trained laboratories, including those previously dedicated to the so-called basic research, were able to shift gears and contribute enormously not only to the understanding of the disease at the molecular and physio-pathological level but also to the production of diagnostic kits, medical supplies and even personal protective equipment for the general public. Clearly, these are reasons enough to be proud of. This ‘proudness’ of the scientific community needs to be counterbalanced by modesty and self-criticism when thinking of the communication and dissemination levels, in terms of both skills and achievements, something that will be discussed later. However, despite all these scientific deeds, we consider that the technical capacities, expertise and knowledge of academic scientists could have been exploited even further and better. To illustrate this point, a good example would be the amount of idle capacity left aside despite the needs for massive testing. We dare to propose this reveals bureaucratic and organizational obstacles that would need to be revisited and if possible dismantled for future, although undesired, ‘opportunities’.Throughout history, critical times offer examples of extreme sacrifice from scientists. During World War II’s 28-month-long siege of Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), several workers at the Leningrad seedbank transformed their workplace into a safehouse and bunker. They protected the seeds, fruits and other specimens from every threat that emerged, even their own hunger. Many of these workers starved to death while literally being surrounded by food. They were confident that their sacrifice for keeping those resources would allow many others to stay alive during the years to come. The scientist that started that germplasm collection, which reached about 250,000 specimens by the year 1940, was Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov7. The work of Vavilov and the sacrifice of those workers that protected the seedbank paid off in following years. According to the writings of the Russian food historian Genady Golubev that came out in 1979, “four-fifths of all the Soviet Union’s cultivated areas are sown with varieties derived from Vavilov’s collection”8. Unquestionably, wars are quite different from pandemics, as they develop from human cruelty and barbarity, not as the unfortunate outbreak of a pathogen. Nevertheless, both can sometimes teach us similar lessons. Just like with the seedbank workers, healthcare professionals have been forced to face unimaginable sacrifice during the course of the pandemic910. How science works towards easing that sacrifice, how it intervenes in the healthcare system and in decision-making, has been and will continue to be quite determinant in the near future.A necessary learning process ought to take place within the scientific community to overcome the still undergoing pandemic and to be better prepared for future crises. In the same way as installing airbags and fastening seat belts would not be feasible during a car accident, acting without extensive previous preparation during a pandemic has likely limited our variety of responses and their outcomes. As with the current COVID-19 pandemic, there may only be a few hints about the kind of problems we will face in the future. However, there are some general actions, common ideas, basic preparations that could be adopted to confront the next crisis in a better manner. Our proposal is based on these ideas, learning from the current experience to optimize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the scientific system to streamline responses when critical situations arise.A key element to take into account is that science needs to be involved in the decision-making process. For that, it is unquestionable that a better interaction has to be developed and established with the decision makers, without which proper guidance based on scientific evidence is impossible. Concurrently, a better interaction with the general public should also be developed, since improving that would encourage compliance of the chosen measures. In brief, science needs to build a connection network with relevant social actors to be ready to explain and recommend decisions and to provide guidance. That articulation might not look as crucial during calm times but is extremely difficult to implement once a crisis has already started, as we are seeing today. By working together with politicians, health authorities, communicators and other social actors, scientists could become better integrated to the region’s/country’s response to whatever disrupting event might develop, diminishing the material and human costs produced by extra-logistics or bureaucracy.Taking all of the above into account, we would like to scrutinize the role of science from two different angles. The first one, technical, includes providing concrete solutions that help ameliorate the consequences of the pandemic. The second one, social, includes providing non-scientists the tools to help them deal with an abrupt change in their context, both now and in the challenges that the future holds. It seems improbable that this last-mentioned aspect could be accomplished without deepening the articulation with other actors of the society and for this, it is essential to think not only about what to do during a pandemic but also what science needs to build up during ‘normal times’. Let’s start from the latter.Developing communication skills, channels and networks: Modern society provides a plethora of possibilities for communication and dissemination, although unfortunately they seem to be poorly exploited or misused by the scientific community. We consider that training scientists in the art of communication could enhance understanding, reliability and recognition from general audience. In terms of reliability, it is not a good practice to ‘oversell’ scientific discoveries, particularly those dealing with human health and disease, as they generate high expectations that many times do not end up properly fulfilled. It is noteworthy that scientific findings do need certain level of comprehension of the underlying concepts for their proper dissemination. Therefore, without competing with or excluding specialized journalists, scientists could grow a more personal involvement by participating in discussion forums, as well as social, graphic and audio-visual media. To this end, workshops and courses could be designed and established to take place during undergraduate, masters and/or PhD studies.Improving lab networking for sharing methodologies and know-how: Connecting labs more deeply can streamline decisions and optimize the use of resources. With properly established nodes led by institutions specialized in diagnosis and disease, non-biomedical research laboratories could be ‘prepared’ to jump in, allocating different kind of resources (human and equipment). Among the latter, there are a large number of professionals that despite not being dedicated to diagnosing on a daily basis can easily handle biochemical and molecular techniques as well as make available appropriate lab equipment during urgent times. If such networking would be organized during ‘normal’ times, it could help act faster in response to emerging diseases, by tracking infections, spreading, identifying underlying causes, developing methods for detection and so on.Exploiting data science to predict future outbreaks: Computational power and artificial intelligence have achieved tremendous advances lately. Just recently, we have heard and read that machine learning could even predict protein 3D structure out of an amino acid sequence11. On the other hand, variables like population growth and reduction of natural environments suggest that issues such as pollution, drought, climate change, crop-yield loss and emergence of new pathogens are likely to worsen. Altogether these make it extremely important for data scientists to be integrated in the previously described network, in order to facilitate surveillance, identifying upcoming crises and predicting new threats.Science’s duty. As scientists we are privileged, we deal with first-hand information (that most of the time we are able to understand) and carry technical knowledge and resources that can be helpful in these critical circumstances. These technical knowledge and skills could be used (in some cases) to detect pathogens, diagnose diseases and develop treatments. In such cases, we have a moral obligation to provide our intellectual resources and skills to society. By engaging in these tasks, we can help increase diagnostic capabilities in our region/country, while diminishing the burden on health personnel that normally runs these assays. Since early diagnosis could reduce the spread of the infection, by engaging we could also help reduce the number of cases and fatalities, lessening the damage (at different levels) and gaining time until a treatment is found or a vaccine is developed. To diagnose a disease, an illness, might require more than the knowledge to perform a molecular assay, that is why being part of a network that connects research labs with health institutions is crucial. As we expressed before, developing such a network during ‘normal times’ is of paramount relevance as this could ease the work during a pandemic.Scientists with strong background, knowledge and experience of relevance for the causal agent of the pandemic (or the particular crisis whatsoever) must work to find treatments, to develop diagnostic tools and to generate ways to prevent or circumvent infections. Depending on the particular pathogen or event underlying the given crisis, this work may be carried out by a few groups working on related issues, with a bigger bunch of laboratories and scientists collaborating with these groups and also engaging in all the other activities previously described. We firmly believe that science has excelled in this matter and continues to do so during the current pandemic, probably reaching its peak once extensive vaccination throughout the world is accomplished.Nevertheless, the weight that scientists have on the decision-making regarding the use and commercialization of the fruits of their research has a lot of room for improvement. We believe that a deeper influence on managerial choices could prevent the misuse/unfair usage of research, like the one exhibited by the uneven vaccine rollout. We understand the importance of companies recovering their investments and having reasonable margins of profit, but it needs to be contextualized within a pandemic where products can change the destiny of the global population, thus needing to be equally, globally and fairly accessed. Patents, copyrights and intellectual property ought to be considered in context.Increasing the level of collaboration between different disciplines and between different countries as well as the speed of the publication process and equal access to the findings. This basically means to expand the borders for scientific collaboration and, even more than that, to eliminate these frontiers. Interestingly, this is also something that science has been able to achieve to a certain extent during the current pandemic. Scientific reports related to COVID-19 are involving interdisciplinary work, novel collaborative efforts among groups from different parts of the world and changes in the topics of study of a large number of labs. Scientists that were previously working in aspects related to the molecular and cellular biology of yeasts or plants are now working together with virologists to develop diagnostic tools and/or treatments. This way of ‘producing’ science, of generating knowledge, is far more convenient than a model based on competition between groups and hiding/keeping results to be able to generate more publications from an individual perspective. This is also true for the way scientific discoveries reach the worldwide audience. Preprint servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv are now the first choice for scientists around the globe to rapidly publish and share their results. It is worth mentioning that manuscripts uploaded at those servers are lacking peer review; however, they rapidly gain high visibility and hundreds/thousands of scientists check, comment and discuss these findings in an almost immediate fashion. In this sense, findings reported as preprints are scrutinized by far more peers than those published in well-established journals that are only viewed by two or three reviewers. It is worth noting that along this pandemic year, several journals have made an effort to revise and adjust their publication policies in order to facilitate science dissemination and progress even during difficult times for experimental work. Nevertheless, paywalls, extremely long revision times and high publication costs are some of the features of a publication system that, in current times, is more a burden to the scientific community than a way to share our work and reach a wider audience. If we are a bit lucky (and also work for that to happen) we may conquer a better and more efficient way to do and share science thanks to this pandemic.Communicating through the available channels. We have just mentioned the importance of developing communication strategies during quiet times, although that does not mean that there is nothing to be done currently, it is just being harder. In a world with a growing expression of anti-science movements like flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers, the effort towards bringing evidence-based facts to the general public needs to be maximized. As R. Dawkins would say: we need to convince the general audience that science works.The scientific community ought to recognize itself with the privilege of knowledge, which in turn should motivate a commitment towards society. When disarticulated from the latter, the scientific community becomes an isolated elite. Then, our abilities to handle techniques, technologies and concepts that help evaluate, diagnose, treat and analyse situations become squandered. Cruel proof of this is how, after the fastest development of a vaccine ever recorded, there seems to be a growing disbelief and reticence from the public to use it.The reason for such a counter-intuitive behavior, in our opinion, lies in the nature of the intricate relationship between the scientific community and lay audiences. Science is not a closed package consisting only of technical knowledge: it influences the decision-making of both politicians and everyone else, it affects the economy in innumerable ways and, most importantly, it shapes the paradigm of knowledge of a given era. The surge of anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theory advocates and other anti-science movements is not new but gained influence during the pandemic, exposing our incapacity or our failure to reach a large proportion of the population. Those groups also reveal that generating a deeper articulation among the academy and governments, media and the public is something quite difficult to achieve overnight, rendering it urgent to extreme the efforts on doing so, during this pandemic and also when it would be over. Only then will the science’s resources be made the most of, specially facing future world-wide challenges that will likely arise.The rise in distrust exhibits that there is a lot of room for improvement regarding the scientific communication and its interaction with the population. Through special attention in transparency, tone and patience, we believe it possible to achieve not only technical excellence but also higher and better appreciation and understanding from the public. These are key elements to build trust in order to apply massive treatments or vaccination protocols.These seem a lot to achieve but there would be no harm in trying. We face a great opportunity to improve science as we know it, towards one that is deeply connected with society while also more collaborative, less inspired in impact factors and elitism, more empathic and motivated to solve problems.The privilege of knowledge can be a great power; hence, it comes with great responsibility. There is definitely room for growth: taking part in the decision-making process by connecting with politicians, health authorities and other social actors; engaging in science communication; priming a publication system based on sharing findings and accelerating research and development. From our point of view, the best thing science can achieve during pandemics and also before/after them is embarking deliberately in a path of improving itself having in sight its integration with the rest of the society.■We thank all the people with whom we were able to interact and collaborate along different COVID-related projects for helpful and inspiring discussions.","['thinking', 'loud:', 'science', 'faces', 'crises']"

"Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence",2022,"ATLAS OF AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence by Kate Crawford. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021. 336 pages. Hardcover; $28.00. ISBN: 9780300209570. *Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence is Kate Crawford's analysis of the state of the AI industry. A central idea of her book is the importance of redefining Artificial Intelligence (AI). She states, ""I've argued that there is much at stake in how we define AI, what its boundaries are, and who determines them: it shapes what can be seen and contested"" (p. 217). *My own definition of AI goes something like this: I¬†imagine a future where I'm sitting in a cafe drinking coffee with my friends, but in this future, one of my friends is a robot, who like me is trying to make a living in this world. A future where humans and robots live in harmony. Crawford views this definition as mythological: ""These mythologies are particularly strong in the field of artificial intelligence, where the belief that human intelligence can be formalized and reproduced by machines has been axiomatic since the mid-twentieth century"" (p.¬†5). I do not know if my definition of artificial intelligence can come true, but I am enjoying the process of building, experimenting, and dreaming. *In her book, she asks me to consider that I may be unknowingly participating, as she states, in ""a material product of colonialism, with its patterns of extraction, conflict, and environmental destruction"" (p. 38). The book's subtitle illuminates the purpose of the book: specifically, the power, politics, and planetary costs of usurping artificial intelligence. Of course, this is not exactly Crawford's subtitle, and this is where I both agree and disagree with her. The book's subtitle is actually Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence. In my opinion, AI is more the canary in the coal mine. We can use the canary to detect the poisonous gases, but we cannot blame the canary for the poisonous gas. It risks missing the point. Is AI itself to be feared? Should we no longer teach or learn AI? Or is this more about how we discern responsible use and direction for AI technology? *There is another author who speaks to similar issues. In Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O'Neil states it this way, ""If we had been clear-headed, we all would have taken a step back at this point to figure out how math had been misused ... But instead ... new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever ... A computer program could speed through thousands of resumes or loan applications in a second or two and sort them into neat lists, with the most promising candidates on top"" (p. 13). *Both Crawford and O'Neil point to human flaws that often lead to well-intentioned software developers creating code that results in unfair and discriminatory decisions. AI models encode unintended human biases that may not evaluate candidates as fairly as we would expect, yet there is a widespread notion that we can trust the algorithm. For example, the last time you registered an account on a website, did you click the checkbox confirming that ""yes, I read the disclaimer"" even though you did not? When we click ""yes"" we are accepting this disclaimer and placing trust in the software. Business owners place trust in software when they use it to make predictions. Engineers place trust in their algorithms when they write software without rigorous testing protocols. I¬†am just as guilty. *Crawford suggests that AI is often used in ways that are harmful. In the Atlas of AI we are given a tour of how technology is damaging our world: strip mining, labor injustice, the misuse of personal data, issues of state and power, to name a few of the concerns Crawford raises. The reality is that AI is built upon existing infrastructure. For example, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Amazon, TikTok have been collecting our information for profit even before AI became important to them. The data centers, CPU houses, and worldwide network infrastructure were already in place to meet consumer demand and geopolitics. But it is true that AI brings new technologies to the table, such as automated face recognition and decision tools to compare prospective employment applicants with diverse databases and employee monitoring tools that can make automatic recommendations. Governments, militaries, and intelligence agencies have taken notice. As invasion of privacy and social justice concerns emerge, Crawford calls us to consider these issues carefully. *Reading Crawford's words pricked my conscience, convicting me to reconsider my erroneous ways. For big tech to exist, to supply what we demand, it needs resources. She walks us through the many resources the technology industry needs to provide what we want, and AI is the ""new kid on the block."" This book is not about AI, per se; it is instead about the side effects of poor business/research practices, opportunist behavior, power politics, and how these behaviors not only exploit our planet but also unjustly affect marginalized people. The AI industry is simply a new example of this reality: data mining, low wages to lower costs, foreign workers with fewer rights, strip mining, relying on coal and oil for electricity (although some tech companies have made strides to improve sustainability). This sounds more like a parable about the sins of the tech industry than a critique about the dangers of AI. *Could the machine learning community, like the inventors of dynamite who wanted to simply help railroads excavate tunnels, be unintentionally causing harm? Should we, as a community, be on the lookout for these potential harms? Do we have a moral responsibility? Maybe the technology sector needs to look more inwardly to ensure that process efficiency and cost savings are not elevated as most important. *I did not agree with everything that Crawford classified as AI, but I do agree that as a community we are responsible for our actions. If there are injustices, then this should be important to us. In particular, as people of faith, we should heed the call of Micah 6:8 to act justly in this world, and this includes how we use AI. *Reviewed by Joseph Vybihal, Professor of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G4.","['atlas', 'power,', 'politics,', 'planetary', 'costs', 'artificial', 'intelligence']"
Artificial intelligence impact on banks clients and employees in an Asian developing country,2021,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in banking sector, its impact on banks employees and consumer behavior alike when buying financial services and the importance of (AI) for delivering social services in a western Asian developing country: Lebanon. The author tried to respond to the following problematics: Would AI be able to replace man power in customer service? and would AI change the job of the banker and render the bank more profitable? Design/methodology/approach The data collected and analyzed was used in a quantitative research-based models with the application of hypothesis regression models. The results obtained has helped despite the fact of its innovative framework, AI cannot replace the role of humans when it comes to client’s interactions with banks employees. Findings AI elevates the quality of banking transactions to an upper edge. Some of the technical banking jobs might be in jeopardy with AI, as the technology can be easily replaced with human resources, but when emotional intelligence is required for banks clients/employee’s relationship management, AI has been found with no ability to supersede. Research limitations/implications Researchers in the future can also compare large banks called alpha banks to smaller banks in the same developing country to further test the possibility of adopting innovation and change through AI in different sizes of banks with larger number of employees, financial resources and corporate clients. Practical implications Fears regarding impact on employment were detected, AI could render many banks’ jobs obsolete in the coming years, asserting that AI and robotics “reduce the need for staff in roles such as back office functions. Data suggests that the proliferation of AI could be accompanied by a rise in banking jobs. It may also be the case that only the most mundane jobs such as data entry will be sacrificed for machine superiority. While a rise in job numbers associated with higher AI-adoption rates seems ideal, some evidence suggests that most financial institutions are not yet fully confident in how to effectively apply the technology for the best results but at the same time seemed to be receptive to using AI and machine learning in their organization. Social implications This study was conducted and limited to one developing Asian country, it would be useful to stretch this study covering other countries in the region to dive into more diversified results that could trigger researchers to compare more the adoption of AI in Asian countries and evaluating its impact with respect to different countries size and/or level of development in addition to other demographics and criteria. Originality/value Financial institutions are increasingly using artificial neural network systems to detect fraud and charges that do not meet the standard. The AI is used to: organize transactions; keep accounts; invest in stocks; optimize portfolios, etc. Reducing the number of frauds and financial crimes in Lebanon by monitoring user behavior to detect abnormal changes or anomalies in addition to the possible rectification of human economic behavior in the Asian region, this could add a great value and high originality to the research.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'impact', 'banks', 'clients', 'employees', 'asian', 'developing', 'country']"
Negotiating limits on algorithmic management in digitalised services: cases from Germany and Norway,2022,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms are increasingly used to monitor employees and to automate management decisions. In this article, we ask how worker representatives adapt traditional collective voice institutions to regulate the adoption and use of these tools in the workplace. Our findings are based on a comparative study of union and works council responses to algorithmic management in contact centres from two similar telecommunications companies in Germany and Norway. In both case studies, worker representatives mobilised collective voice institutions to protect worker privacy and discretion associated with remote monitoring and workforce management technologies. However, they relied on different sources of institutional power, connected to co-determination rights, enforcement of data protection laws, and labour cooperation structures.","['negotiating', 'limits', 'algorithmic', 'management', 'digitalised', 'services:', 'cases', 'germany', 'norway']"
A Review of The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Employee Engagement,2023,"This paper aims to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in employee engagement through a literature review.

Decision Support Concept for Improvement of Sustainability-Related Competences,2022,"In this paper, we derived competences from previously developed competence models, ensuring the effective use of advanced technologies in future factories to improve the sustainability of their business models and strategies. Based on the analysis of the Hogan competence model and competence models for sustainability and leadership, we compiled a selection of competences for digitalisation, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and soft competences such as emotional intelligence and cultural literacy. We also included competences required for sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and circular economy. The selected competences formed the core for the conceptual development of a decision support tool for the individualised selection of training for employees. The concept was tested in customised training to improve employees’ skills and motivation for lifelong learning at the selected industrial partner. The developed assessment algorithm was used to monitor the progress of individual employees’ skills development before and after their training participation. The results of the assessment help human resource departments make decisions for selecting the most effective and optimal training for employees to improve their sustainability-related competences. Such a systematic approach can improve and evaluate competences that companies need to transition to a circular economy.","['decision', 'support', 'concept', 'improvement', 'sustainability-related', 'competences']"

Artificial Intelligence in HRM: Role of Emotional–Social Intelligence and Future Work Skill,2023,"Purpose: In recent times, 'artificial intelligence (AI)' has been pervasive even in organisations or at home. AI is defined as programming computers or other technological devices to act, react, respond, or assist the same way humans do. AI has undeniably made people's lives easier. In organisations, the impact of AI is even more visible. The main aim of this chapter is to examine the significant role of future work skill's (FWS) each component in the field of on-growing automation. The focus will be especially on emotional and social intelligence (ESI) (a key component of FWS) while adopting AI.Need of the Study: In terms of human resource management (HRM), AI is useful for people management, payroll services, staff monitoring and improving the recruiting network, among other things. Even managers put their organisation's job openings on the web and get applicant resumes electronically. People and employees in the organisation have become more advanced and innovative due to AI. A device obtains employee attendance, and human resource (HR) can track their employees and their organisation's workforce data. HR has now been awarded more authority to manage and fix their employee's problems because of AI. In a rapidly changing world, AI is affecting all aspects. AI is yearning to automate all of the jobs.Methodology: Now a question arises how we can stay relevant in AI economic development? As humans, we learned that every issue is a problem of optimisation because we simply require human skills to develop, create and innovate new things. Therefore, researchers recognised that adopting sustainable growth skills encourages people to continue learning throughout their lives. Moreover, AI has enabled machines the ability to learn over time. Still, they will never be able to develop new ideas like human intelligence. A machine can use only one fixed data algorithm. Now humans have made significant progress in various fields with the help of FWS; without integrated computer sciences, brain science would not make such an outstanding achievement. On the other hand, human minds are masters of their intelligence, such as creativity, complex problem-solving, cognitive thinking, ESI and communication. Breakthrough human mind are masters of algorithms represented people have to understand new trends of technology around us, and the best way to move forward is to be aware, adapt and update skills.Practical Implications: However, AI is required because, regardless of technological advancements, AI is leading Industry 4.0. The industry's transformation is in 4.0, and hopefully, 5.0 will jump on board soon. Undoubtedly, AI should streamline the process and eliminate redundancy or administrative tasks.Finding: AI can be more effective in organisations if they incorporate other FWS, particularly the soft human ESI skills, whereas AI is present everywhere, we can still not neglect FWS, especially ESI. So, this chapter highlights the important role of soft skills, that is, ESI and FWS, while adapting AI for an effective HRM.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'hrm:', 'role', 'emotional–social', 'intelligence', 'future', 'work', 'skill']"
Employee Alerting System Using Real Time Drowsiness Detection,2022,"The paper proposes a system which is developed for detecting drowsiness of an individual in real time. This system aims for the betterment of the society by increasing the productivity of the employee using Artificial Intelligence. This system will use a basic webcam programmed with a code, directly facing the individual to monitor the eyes and mouth of the user to derive whether the individual is drowsy or not. If symptoms of drowsiness such as yawning and closed eyes are detected, then the system buzzes alarm to alert the Employee. It utilizes the concept of Image Processing to detect the target area of the face. Python programming along and Open CV is interfaced for determining if the Eyes are closed and the person is yawning. The main objective of this project is to monitor any Employee who is working online to increase the productivity caused due to drowsiness and work fatigue. First, the edge of the face is detected, after finding the face, eyes and mouth are found using Facial Landmark Detector file in Dlib Library. After locating the eyes and mouth the distance between them is measured to determine whether they are Open or closed. If the Eyes are found closed for a specific time and mouth is found open for a specific time, then it is recorded. If the same continues for more than four times, then the employee gets an alerting buzz.","['employee', 'alerting', 'system', 'real', 'time', 'drowsiness', 'detection']"
Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence: Gerontological and Geriatric Components Medical and Social Support for Active Healthy Longevity,2020,"The “cognitive reserve” construct is a set of variables, including intelligence, education, and mental stimulation, that presumably allows the brain to adapt to underlying pathologies, supporting cognitive function despite underlying neural changes. Brain Homo Sapiens also points to resistance to neuropathological damage and can be defined as the ability to optimize or maximize performance through an effective set of neural networks and/or alternative cognitive strategies. Learning in childhood, the level of education and activities for adults — all this independently contributes to the formation of a cognitive reserve. The introduction of biocomputer nanoplatforms and modules consisting of small molecules, polymers, nucleic acids or proteins/peptides, nanoplatforms are programmed to detect and process external stimuli, such as magnetic fields or light, or internal stimuli, such as nucleic acids, enzymes or pH, using three different mechanisms: system assembly, system disassembly or system transformation. Current biocomputer nanoplatforms are invaluable for many applications, including medical diagnostics, biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and delivery of therapeutic drugs to target cell populations. The future implementation of systems biology and systems neurophysiology paradigms based on complex analysis of large and deep heterogeneous data sources will be crucial to achieve a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, using current brain-computer and artificial intelligence interface technologies, in order to increase information that can be extracted from preclinical and clinical indicators. Integration of different sources of information will allow researchers to obtain a new holistic picture of the pathophysiological process of the disease, which will cover from molecular changes to cognitive manifestations. The new competencies of psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology play a strategic role in interdisciplinary science and interdisciplinary planning and decision-making. The introduction of multi-vector neurotechnologies of artificial intelligence and the principles of digital health care will contribute to the development of modern neuroscience and neuromarketing. Medical and social support for active healthy longevity is possible when synchronizing information systems of medical organizations and social institutions, introducing a single neurophysiological circuit and modern neurointerfaces, a combined and hybrid cluster in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation of cognitive disorders and cognitive disorders. A key factor in medical and social support is the participation of interdisciplinary business employees and data processing specialists (their support, monitoring), as well as the availability of sufficient staff literacy in data management.","['bioinformatics', 'artificial', 'intelligence:', 'gerontological', 'geriatric', 'components', 'medical', 'social', 'support', 'active', 'healthy', 'longevity']"

A review of literature demonstrates how AI is already being used to automate routine tasks, freeing up employees' time for more strategic initiatives that create greater business value. Advanced analytics further empower workers to gain deeper insights and make more informed decisions. Meanwhile, AI assistants coach employees to reach higher levels of performance. Overall, the synthesis of human strengths with AI leads to higher levels of innovation, efficiency, and output. However, successful integration requires updating training programs, reconsidering job roles and KPIs, monitoring for biases, and prioritizing transparency.","['supercharge', 'human', 'potential', 'through', 'increase', 'productivity', 'workforce', 'companies']"
Comparison of performances of fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for estimating employee labor loss,2023,"As a result of artificial intelligence research that started in the 1950s, the need for human beings in all sectors and labor markets constantly decreases. The increase in the total cost of the labor force increases the productivity pressure on the labor. For this reason, the workforce participating in production is expected to be more efficient and productive. For this reason, the loss of labor is carefully monitored and tried to be reduced as much as possible. However, with each passing day, labor losses are inevitable due to personnel turnover, work accidents, dismissals, and absenteeism. Humanity is still struggling, mainly due to the contagious covid-19 virus, which has recently affected the world. Since it is a condition that affects human health, its adverse effects have been observed in many areas where people are present. Especially in this period, unpredictable workforce losses have occurred in the production and service sectors since people are mostly the primary workforce. Since there is no plan and measure for such a situation in most risk planning, it also brings labor losses and costs. In this study, In order to examine the relationship between health problems and loss of labor, the amount of lost labor due to employees who could not come to work due to health-related reasons was tried to be estimated by Fuzzy Logic and ANFIS methods. This study examined three-year absenteeism data of employees in a courier company, and twenty-eight reasons for absenteeism were determined. The amount of labor loss was estimated using Fuzzy Logic and ANFIS methods, using five factors that cause absenteeism. Estimated and actual values were statistically compared with MAD MAPE, MSE, and RMSE performance measurement values. With fuzzy logic, the MAD value is 4.76; the MAPE value is 155.7; The MSE value was calculated as 52.7, and the RMSE value as 7.26. In ANFIS, the MAD value is 3.2, the MAPE value of 86.24, MSE of 27.5; The RMSE value was calculated as 5.25. When the results are compared, it has been seen that the ANFIS method obtains closer estimations than the fuzzy logic method.","['comparison', 'performances', 'fuzzy', 'logic', 'adaptive', 'neuro-fuzzy', 'inference', 'system', '(anfis)', 'estimating', 'employee', 'labor', 'loss']"
"Role and challenges of ChatGPT, Gemini, and similar generative artificial intelligence in human resource management",2024,"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as ChatGPT, into Human Resource Management (HRM) has marked the beginning of a groundbreaking era in innovative workforce management and employee engagement. This research investigates the pivotal role played by ChatGPT and analogous generative AI technologies in HRM, underscoring their significance in the realms of recruitment, employee training, and organizational communication. Leveraging their natural language processing abilities, these AI systems streamline the recruitment process, ensuring unbiased candidate selection and enhancing the overall efficiency of HR departments.

The concept of the formation and development of a digital intellectual ecosystem of blended university learning,2020,"The article proposes the concept of the formation and development of an adaptive ecosystem of university learning. The concept can allow not only to eliminate the shortcomings inherent in the distance education system, but also to create the basis for building a full-fledged educational technology. The basis for constructing such an ecosystem, in addition to purely didactic developments, can be modern achievements in the field of systems theory, digitalization and artificial intelligence. The education market is seriously affected by advances in artificial intelligence and the rapid development of Industry 4.0. It is also necessary to consider rather unpredictable natural disasters and pandemics. Under these conditions, the only way to maintain and strengthen their positions in the education market, which will rapidly change in the coming decades, is the transformation of processes within the framework of new technological trends and integrated network cluster ecosystems. Decentralized training and outsourcing can become two key functions for the successful application of artificial intelligence in education. Modeling, optimization and analytics of big data make it possible to form a complete set of technologies for creating an outsourcing network and digital educational chains, which allows us to identify the state model of all processes in real time. At each moment in time, the digital twin displays the status of outsourcing processes and educational chains with actual data on planning, preparing the necessary equipment, directly preparing educational programs, loading teachers, accounting and monitoring learning outcomes, etc. The digital twin can be used both for making decisions in real-time, and for forecasting and planning outsourcing. In fact, the university and the companies providing outsourcing services within the framework of this approach are integrated into a single mechanism for solving tasks of flexible individual training. Within the framework of the proposed approach, it is possible to build an educational university environment integrated with real objects of the economy of the territory, which is a component of the educational ecosystem. The concept under consideration allows predicting and planning the training of required specialists, since the model of its work is closely connected with enterprises in the real sector. This becomes possible due to the fact that training takes place according to flexible programs that reflect the ever-changing requirements of enterprises to the competencies of their employees. In fact, a university or a group of universities is becoming an essential component of territorial industrial clusters, which makes it possible to increase the efficiency and quality of specialist training and to quickly develop new curricula and courses that will quickly develop competencies demanded by the real sector of the economy. The use of artificial intelligence technology in combination with the capabilities of the Internet of things and digitalization of the main business processes provides, in fact, the functioning and development of the university’s ecosystem by analogy with the ecosystems of large sectoral system-forming enterprises.","['concept', 'formation', 'development', 'digital', 'intellectual', 'ecosystem', 'blended', 'university', 'learning']"
Artificial Intelligence: The Degree of Influence on Labor Relations,2023,"The development of artificial intelligence and the introduction of intelligent systems in manufacturing and services are already having a major impact on the relationship between employees and employers: working conditions are changing, the employer’s ability to monitor the performance of their work duties by employees and evaluate the results of their work is expanding. The analysis of the ongoing processes allows us to conclude that in the conditions of Industry 4.0, the further spread of artificial intelligence systems in the world of work is inevitable, which will increase the frequency of human-machine interactions and qualitatively change the production environment. This will be facilitated by reducing the cost of training artificial intelligence and increasing its efficiency, the platformization of the economy, the implementation in practice of the model of smart manufacturing, etc. A further increase in the role of artificial intelligence in the world of work will accompany the transition to the next stage (Industry 5.0), which will affect the actual situation of the employee and the employer, causing the need to make changes to the norms of labour law that consolidate their status as subjects of labour relations.","['artificial', 'intelligence:', 'degree', 'influence', 'labor', 'relations']"

Smart Business and the Social Value of AI,2022,"Abstract Organizations across industries are increasingly using Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to support their innovation processes, supply chains, marketing and sales and other business functions. Implementing AI, firms report efficiency gains from automation and enhanced decision-making thanks to more relevant, accurate and timely predictions. By exposing the benefits of digitizing everything, COVID-19 has only accelerated these processes. Recognizing the growing importance of AI and its pervasive impact, this chapter defines the “social value of AI” as the combined value derived from AI adoption by multiple stakeholders of an organization. To this end, we discuss the benefits and costs of AI for a business-to-business (B2B) firm and its internal, external and societal stakeholders. Being mindful of legal and ethical concerns, we expect the social value of AI to increase over time as the barriers for adoption go down, technology costs decrease, and more stakeholders capture the value from AI. We identify the contributions to the social value of AI, by highlighting the benefits of AI for different actors in the organization, business consumers, supply chain partners and society at large. This chapter also offers future research opportunities, as well as practical implications of the AI adoption by a variety of stakeholders.

Artificial Intelligence and the Post-Covid-19 Recovery Digital technologies are rapidly changing the way businesses operate. There is an increased demand for partially or fully digital products and services; firms interact with customers and supply chain partners via digital channels; internal processes and operations such as production or office management also rely on digital technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these processes and underscored the benefits of ‘digitizing everything’. The biggest organizational changes implemented during the crisis, for example, remote work and reduction in the on-site workforce, will prevail in the post-pandemic recovery, which makes investments in new technologies of strategic importance for businesses. This chapter is focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which was named as the number one technology to help businesses recover and improve after the COVID-19 crisis (McKinsey, 2020b). Looking at the big picture, AI is argued to contribute to economic and societal welfare as well. For example, AI image analysis software CAD4COVID, developed by Delft Imaging, is analysing thousands of chest X-rays from COVID-19 patients and used for diagnostics in 120 hospitals worldwide. 1 Furthermore, it is estimated that AI can add 1.4% of annual GDP growth for the European economy until 2030 (McKinsey, 2020a). This is reflected in the EU's billion euro investments with the ambition ‘… to lead globally in the development and uptake of human-centric, trustworthy, secure and sustainable AI technologies’ (European Commission, 2021, p. 3). Defining the Social Value of AI The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the impact of AI adoption on various stakeholders of a business-to-business (B2B) organization. To this end, we adopt a cost-benefit approach and define the social value of AI as the combined value derived from AI adoption by a B2B organization by multiple stakeholders. More specifically, the social value of AI can be understood as the trade-off between (1) the benefits and improvements this technology brings for stakeholders and (2) the costs and concerns that arise from it. Specifically, we look at the impact of AI on (1) the internal stakeholders in the firm, i.e. the executives and employees, (2) business customers, supply chain partners and competitors, and (3) society at large. Our definition of the social value of AI is rooted in the theory of value creation, which recognizes that ‘value created by organizations […] may not be wholly captured by them but, instead, may spill over into society as a whole’ (Lepak, Smith, & Taylor, 2007). Social value of AI as a central concept in this chapter, emphasizes the overall anticipated impact of AI on many stakeholders of an organization. While the focus of this chapter is the AI adoption by a B2B firm, our definition allows that the social value of AI be created by any type of organization and captured by its stakeholders. AI in Business-to-Business Relationships The B2B literature has noted the pervasive impact of digital technologies on relationships in business networks (see e.g. Hofacker, Golgeci, Pillai, & Gligor, 2020; Pagani & Pardo, 2017). Focussing on AI technology specifically, it has been shown to contribute to improved decision-making and overall firm performance (Bag, Gupta, Kumar, & Sivarajah, 2021) thanks to the ability to generate insights and knowledge from a variety of digital data sources such as for example social media information. Multiple studies have also discussed how AI can support buyer-seller exchanges in the sales process (Luo, Tong, Fang, & Qu, 2019; Paschen, Wilson, & Ferreira, 2020), contract negotiations (Schulze-Horn, Hueren, Scheffler, & Schiele, 2020), or throughout the purchasing process (Schiele & Torn, 2020). Gligor, Pillai, and Golgeci (2021) have recently discussed the potential dark side effects of AI on B2B relationships, such as exacerbated power asymmetries or reinforced organizational inertia. We extend this literature by considering how AI impacts the internal stakeholders and society at large, not only customers and supply chain partners. Ethical Considerations Arising from Digital Technologies This research builds on the developments in business ethics and sustainability literature, which have recently considered the digital domain. Lobschat et al. (2021) defined a new concept of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR), arguing that companies need to assess the impact of digital technologies on business partners in the value chain, individual users of data and technology (customers, managers, employees technology developers), public institutions and non-governmental organizations. Elsewhere, López Jiménez, Dittmar, and Vargas Portillo (2021) theorized that on top of the (minimal) legal requirements, firms will voluntarily subscribe and commit to a stricter, industry-specific code of conduct about the digital activities. Finally, Kumar and Ramachandran (2020) discuss the stakeholder well-being as an outcome of digital transformation, arguing that firms can pursue stakeholder focus together with the adoption of technology and analytics. The contribution of this chapter lies in the discussion of the social value of AI, which extends the above studies in several ways. First, unlike previous studies, we focus on the impact of one specific technology, the AI, and the implication of automation and algorithmic decision-making. Second, Lobschat et al. (2021) and López Jiménez, Dittmar, and Vargas Portillo (2021) have emphasized the importance of the internal processes and corporate self-regulation about digital technologies, and we complement those studies with a more detailed discussion about the pervasive impact of AI on internal and external stakeholders of a B2B company. While Kumar and Ramachandran (2020) discuss multiple stakeholders and focus on the growth strategies that are realized by the focal firm, we contribute with an interdisciplinary review of the impact of AI on the organization, its environment and society. The chapter is organized in the following way. We first discuss AI and related technologies, and discuss its main advantages and disadvantages. Second, we identify different groups of stakeholders that a B2B company should consider when developing AI. Next, we discuss the value contributions to the social value of AI, by showing how different stakeholders can benefit from this technology. We close this chapter with a short discussion and implications for managers. Artificial Intelligence and Its Advantages and Disadvantages Overview of AI and Related Technologies We use the definition of AI proposed by Kaplan and Haenlein (2019), formulated as ‘a system's ability to interpret external data correctly, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation’. A system is understood here as interconnected computers, interfaces, robots, sensors, or any smart devices, governed algorithmically to execute specific actions. AI understood in this narrow sense uses machine learning (ML) algorithms – predetermined rules to achieve prescribed goals based on input data. For example, in predictive analytics, ML analyses vast amounts of historical data to predict the probability of future unknown events. AI is different from other analytics technologies because it evolves and becomes more effective and efficient, thanks to the ability to autonomously learn from past data, from new data sources, as well as from the system's responses via the feedback loop. For a non-technical review of AI technology see e.g. Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2018). The development of AI is closely related to the developments of digital technologies, such as IoT, blockchain, machine-to-machine communications (sensors), robotics, cloud computing, big data, ML and deep learning. For example, used in the Smart Industry, IoT and sensors generate volumes and a variety of data, which are continuously tracked and monitored to optimize production lines with AI. Cloud computing and big data facilitate automation and real-time implementation of algorithmic decision-making. ML is prevalent in everyday life, for example, computer vision is used for face recognition, and natural language processing with voice recognition are used by chatbots and voice assistants. In recent years there has been a discussion about the ability of AI to mimic and surpass human intelligence and creativity (see e.g. Huang & Rust, 2018; Ng, 2016); however, so-called strong AI does not exist yet. We focus here on a narrow definition of AI, and the associated implications of automation and algorithmic decision-making. Benefits of AI Social value of AI as a new concept takes into account the benefits and improvements this technology brings for a variety of stakeholders, as well as the costs and concerns associated with this technology. Looking at the benefits, we focus on two aspects of AI: (1) AI can perform tasks faster and with fewer errors than humans, which leads to efficiency gains; (2) AI's ability to analyse vast amounts of data, which leads to better, more timely predictions and enhanced decision-making (i.e., higher effectiveness). Therefore, AI enables automation and predictive analytics making, which have powerful implications for stakeholders of a B2B company. AI Risks and How to Mitigate Them? The concept of the social value of AI also takes into account the costs and risks associated with this technology. First, the technology is costly to implement and requires significant financial investments for firms, including public subsidies (European Commission, 2021; McKinsey, 2020a). Second, the diffusion of AI within organizations is kerbed by necessary organizational changes, adjustment costs, data vulnerability (cybersecurity), and the lack of skilled staff (Brynjolfsson, Rock, & Syverson, 2017). There are also concerns about the fairness of the algorithms underlying AI, therefore developers and organizations should monitor the quality of training and input data, create algorithms that are fair and appropriate, and evaluate the outcomes for potential bias. Furthermore, AI algorithms need to be explainable: transparent and understandable for decision-makers to allow for inspection. Although algorithmic decision-making in principle implies that AI systems can be autonomous, in order to perform efficiently and ethically correctly, there must be a human in the loop. For a discussion of algorithms from an ethical perspective, see for example Martin (2019). Using lessons learnt from GDPR and California privacy law, companies also anticipate the costs of compliance with stricter AI regulations. 2 For example, the Artificial Intelligence Act in the European Union or the Canadian Algorithmic Impact Assessment are the legislative initiatives regulating the use of AI. 3 While this legislation represents the minimal legal requirements, firms additionally self-regulate to mitigate undesirable AI risks and voluntarily commit to a stricter code of conduct (López Jiménez, Dittmar, & Vargas Portillo, 2021). Signalling the higher standards can lead to an improved brand image, but the non-compliance could imply a damaged credibility and consumer pushback. Finally, there is an important discussion about the development of AI and its negative implications for individuals, such as customer privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, the psychological and emotional drivers of AI resistance, or human-machine interactions. While important in the B2C context, they are less relevant for a B2B company and therefore outside the scope of this research. For a recent discussion on privacy in consumer marketing, we refer the interested reader to the research of Krafft et al. (2021), who developed a framework to understand how both individuals and firms derive value from the data exchange. Algorithmic bias has been covered recently by Lambrecht and Tucker (2020). The work of Puntoni, Reczek, Giesler, and Botti (2020) explains how individuals experience AI, and algorithm resistance is covered for example by Huang and Rust (2018), and Leung, Paolacci, and Puntoni (2018) provide an analytical model of AI job replacement. Social Value of AI Is Expected to Increase Being mindful of the above concerns about AI, we believe that the social value of AI will increase over time. First of all, while capital investment remains a major barrier for the AI diffusion, the information technology costs are declining and we observe the overall growth in computing power. Secondly, the anticipated tightening of laws and regulations about the use of AI can, on the one hand, increase the financial cost for firms, but on the other hand, will decrease the AI risk and concerns for the users and society at large. Overall, we expect the latter effect to dominate because the majority of companies are already actively self-regulating to mitigate AI risks, and there are brand reputation benefits for the voluntary code-of-conduct about the use of AI (López Jiménez, Dittmar, & Vargas Portillo, 2021; McKinsey, 2020a). Thirdly, over time the AI algorithms become better and more efficient thanks to their learning capacity, which increases the AI value. Furthermore, we expect that the AI skills gap, a major obstacle for AI diffusion at the moment, will slowly close, given the emergence of dedicated programs at academic institutions. Finally, as AI becomes more pervasive in industries and societies, more and more stakeholders will reap their benefits, thus increasing the social value of AI. Key Stakeholders in B2B Building on stakeholder theory, we aim to understand the pervasive impact of AI on various actors in the value chain of a B2B company. Stakeholder theory proposes that successful companies need to take into account all the ‘publics’ that have an influence on the firm. Therefore, the focal firm must consider its position in a business ecosystem, maintain relationships with stakeholder groups, understand their role in value co-creation as well as their interests (see e.g. Hult, Mena, Ferrell, & Ferrell, 2011; Hillebrand, Driessen, & Koll, 2015). This is relevant because B2B relationships are an increasingly complex network of co-existing and codependent relationships between organizations: suppliers, business customers, distribution partners in the global value chain and competitors (Hofacker et al., 2020; Pagani & Pardo, 2017). Stakeholder theory is also relevant for AI diffusion, currently driven by joint investments in public-private partnership (ppp) initiatives. For example, the EU's Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence (European Commission, 2021) emphasizes the joint role of businesses, SMEs, start-ups as well as policymakers, academic institutions, and NGOs in the responsible development of AI. We analyse three levels of stakeholders that the focal firm needs to consider so that the development of AI takes place with regard to the well-being of individuals, customers and society. As such, the focal firm can contribute to the social value of AI across three levels: (1) the internal environment level, represented by the organization itself, with top management and employees (including salespeople) as the key stakeholders, (2) the immediate environment, represented by the immediate actors in the value chain, with whom the focal firm has direct interactions: customers, supply chain partners and competitors, (3) the remote environment (macroenvironment) where the focal organization has only an indirect influence. Nevertheless, the focal firm needs to take into account the influence of external stakeholders on its strategy and operations. These stakeholder groups are the government, public and academic institutions, NGOs, industry associations and technology ecosystems. Key Stakeholders within the Organization Executives Seek Efficiency Gains Associated with AI According to the aforementioned McKinsey Report (2020a), the development and implementation of AI technology have become now a strategic priority among the companies leading in digital transformation. Executives recognize that adopting AI can generate business value, through increased revenues and cost reductions. Employees Might Resist Work Automation The proliferation of AI means that well-structured, routine and repetitive tasks are automated and managed by algorithms; for a recent review of developments in digital technologies in the workplace see e.g. Bondarouk, Parr, and Furtmueller (2017). In Amazon warehouses, the algorithms can determine the tasks and how they should be executed by the workers, and they also continuously track performance (van Rijmenam, 2020). However, job automation and algorithmization of tasks may lead to frustration, feeling of scrutiny, reduced interactions between employees, as well as lower employee engagement because ‘following the script’ reduces creativity and independence (Kellogg, Valentine, & Christin, 2020). Furthermore, employees might resist AI fear of being replaced by a technology that can perform their job tasks faster and with fewer errors. On the other hand, automation of routine tasks frees employee capacity to solve more creative, complex tasks, increasing employee engagement and overall firm performance (Kumar & Pansari, 2016). How Is AI Used in Sales Organizations? We consider salespeople as one specific group of employees affected by the adoption of AI in a B2B organization. AI is already assisting humans in marketing and sales tasks at all stages of the B2B funnel; for a detailed review see e.g. Agnihotri (2020) or Paschen et al. (2020). For example, in the prospecting phase AI algorithms analyse large volume of data to build better prospect profiles and to qualify leads (Meire, Ballings, & Van den Poel, 2017). In the (pre-)approach phase ML can improve the targeting and retargeting of digital advertising (Järvinen & Taiminen, 2016), and natural language processing is used by conversational sales chatbots to interact with prospects (Luo et al., 2019); ML algorithms are used in automatic dynamic pricing systems to help close the deals (Leung, Luk, Choy, Lam, & Lee, 2019); as well as automating the workflows, services, customer relationship management post-sales (Chatterjee, Rana, Tamilmani, & Sharma, 2021; Libai et al., 2020). Finally, AI has the potential to play an important role in the on-the-job training of salespeople. In this context, Luo, Qin, Fang, and Qu (2021) have demonstrated through a series of experiments that using an AI coach (vs. a human coach) leads to improved salesperson sales rates. External Stakeholders: Business Customers and Supply Chain Partners Consider an example of a bicycle manufacturing industry, which since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic has seen an exploding consumer demand. While other industries begin to recover, the majority of bicycle manufacturers have been affected by a lockdown of a production site from a key supplier, Shimano, which holds 65% of the market for high-end breaks and gears. 4 This single event contributed to the continued global bike shortage as the manufacturers report now average lead times of about 400 days – a number comparable to producing a luxury car. As seen from this example, business relationships are nowadays very dynamic and complex. Digital technologies and AI facilitate the connectedness of this global marketplace (Hofacker et al., 2020; Pagani & Pardo, 2017), by connecting partners directly, and effectively blurring the boundaries between buyers and suppliers. Adopting AI within a firm will impact the stakeholder groups that lie immediately within the firm's value chain: the business customers and the downstream and upstream supply chain. Furthermore, those external stakeholders may encourage the firm's decision to adopt AI. To realize efficiency from process automation, AI systems require a good alignment of buyers and suppliers in the network, integration of data and real-time data sharing with business partners to generate valuable insights. Through collaboration the focal firm and its business partners can extract more value from AI. Business Customers For a focal B2B company, important buyers constitute end-users or manufacturers whom a focal firm supplies with materials and subcomponents required in the production process. A company adopting AI can leverage big data about consumers and markets to better manage business relationships, and cost-effectively personalize products and services. Predictive customer lifetime value (CLV) models and value-based segmentation will be more accurate and better, taking into account not only the transaction but also social media information. This results in better customer development but also more effective loyalty programs and incentives (Libai et al., 2020), and a higher engagement between B2B firms (Chatterjee et al., 2021). Suppliers and Supply Chain Partners A focal B2B firm also needs strong relationships with upstream and downstream supply chain partners such as their own suppliers, distribution partners and retailers, and companies that provide products and services to support their operations. Recall the example of the bicycle manufacturing industry: when a key supplier experiences production shortages, manufacturers can benefit from being a preferred customer and prioritized deliveries. In this context, AI systems are used in B2B companies to automate procurement processes and gain better insights about suppliers and sourcing opportunities. New and publicly available data sources such as social media information, industry reports, or global news events can be used to provide additional information about supplier opportunities. Schiele and Torn (2020) consider how AI systems can be incorporated in procurement at all the stages of the purchasing process. For example, AI-based virtual interactive chatbots can facilitate suppliers in creating proposals, which then are being analysed and preselected using text mining. AI algorithms can facilitate the execution of complex negotiations, which in B2B involve many parties, multiple decision criteria (e.g. delivery times, guarantees, prices, quantities) as well as quality and budget constraints. This is typically a hard optimization problem and AI systems can explore unobvious solutions to reach an acceptable outcome for all parties involved (Schulze-Horn et al., 2020). Looking at the downstream operations B2B firms cooperate with distribution partners and retailers to deliver their goods to end-users. In logistics, AI and ML use the RFID and blockchain to track materials, components, and products throughout the value chain to optimize and automate the schedule of deliveries (Tsolakis, Zissis, Papaefthimiou, & Korfiatis, 2021). Operations in large logistics hubs, such as for example Port of Rotterdam, rely on autonomous navigation and Automated Guided Vehicles, and use AI analytics for optimization and container management. 5 COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of the global supply chains, disrupting for example the bike manufacturing industry. Dubey, Bryde, Blome, Roubaud, and Giannakis (2021) show that in unpredictable events like COVID-19, companies within a strong alliance are able to take advantage of AI analytics and improve operational and financial performance. Competitors There is an active discussion on how AI will affect the competition and the markets, because algorithms can induce mechanisms promoting the competition and hindering it. Looking at algorithmic pricing, research has found that, on the one hand, AI can lead to lower prices thanks to better forecasting, but on the other hand, algorithms can also learn to play collusive strategies (Miklós-Thal & Tucker, 2019). Varian (2019) considers how first mover advantages are created thanks to returns to scale (economies of scale, indirect network effects and learning-by-doing effect) in the industries using AI. While imitation from late movers is possible thanks to public data sources, open source AI algorithms and cheap cloud computing infrastructure, Varian (2019) identifies the lack of expertise as the major obstacle for AI diffusion. Furthermore, as a result of digitization ‘firms are compelled to compete with their partners and collaborate with their competitors’ (Hofacker et al., 2020, p. 1163). Therefore, competition and value co-creation emerge as two phenomena that are integral to the analysis of B2B relationships. Focussing on AI adoption, it has been linked with improved competitive advantage and increase in relative power of a focal firm (Chatterjee et al., 2021), but it can also hinder interorganizational trust (Gligor et al., 2021). Macro Perspective: Societal Stakeholders and Other Interest Groups Apart from internal stakeholders and supply chain partners, there are actors in the distant environment of the firm who will be affected by the firm's AI adoption. Those actors will also influence the firm's decision about AI development. Governmental bodies, public administration institutions, and NGOs shape the legal environment about the use of AI to protect individual and consumer rights. Furthermore, governmental actors and policymakers have an interest in AI development, foreseeing potential for economic growth and societal improvements. They offer public funding opportunities to stimulate AI development, balancing economic gains and responsible AI use. For example, the European Commission has set forth an aligned AI policy priority and investments for AI R&D with the aim of ‘… seizing the benefits and promoting the development of human-centric, sustainable, secure, inclusive and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI)’ (European Commission, 2021, p. 2). Industry associations and accreditation bodies give representation for small and medium-sized businesses to influence AI policies. Furthermore, industry associations are an ecosystem through which businesses learn, share knowledge and experience about AI solutions, improving the diffusion of AI. Industry associations may promote their own standards about AI, writing a code of conduct which complements the legislation. For example, recently a Data Pro Code was proposed by the association of the Dutch ICT sector, NL Digital. Companies who voluntarily subscribe to these strict regulations signal a commitment to responsible AI, which can enhance brand image. Violating the code could lead to the damaged credibility and consumer pushback (López Jiménez, Dittmar, & Vargas Portillo, 2021). AI incubator ecosystems arise from the geographical convergence of high technology start-ups, academic institutions, enterprises, and governmental actors. Thanks to the access to human resources, capital and infrastructure, there are collaboration opportunities and synergies for the actors. Within this ecosystem, high technology start-ups are a source of AI innovations (Garbuio & Lin, 2019). Successful start-ups attract talent and capital and give back to the community (‘pay it forward mentality’). Big multinational enterprises present in the incubators further attract talent, provide financ","['smart', 'business', 'social', 'value']"
Monitoring Remote Employees at FinPro,2021,"In response to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments across the world have issued containment and mitigation restrictions to hinder the disease from spreading. To sustain operations and ensure continuity, businesses moved to remote working for their employees. To better hold work-from-home (WFH) employees accountable, employers have begun to use monitoring software, including emotion recognition software, to track employee productivity, their compliance with information security policy, and so on. This paper presents a teaching case based on a fictitious company inspired by the actual experiences of employees working at a global financial services provider. Educators worldwide in information systems or business courses can use the teaching case at the undergraduate or graduate level. The case introduces students to Financial Professional Services (""FinPro""), a fictitious American firm that makes the decision to monitor remote employees. It implements both software that records and controls end user activity and emotion recognition software. The teaching case overviews artificial intelligence and emotion recognition software and provides an opportunity for students to examine employers' and employees' different perspectives regarding monitoring.","['monitoring', 'remote', 'employees', 'finpro']"
The Employee’s Right to Privacy Transformation: Digitalization Challenges,2022,"The development of digital technologies applied for electronic monitoring of employees, artificial intelligence systems and transition to remote employment have naturally lead to a change in the content of the employee’s right to privacy. The lack of generally binding international labor standards in the mentioned sphere creates prerequisites for the increasing role of local regulation and legitimation of judicial practice. The authors come to the conclusion that at the legislative level, not only the monitoring over the employee’s performance of labor functions, but also the process of dissemination and use of the data obtained in order to make other personnel decisions should be limited. The purpose of this research is to substantiate the assertion that in the context of digitalization it becomes necessary to consider the right of an employee to privacy as one of the fundamental principles of the legal regulation of labor relations.","['employee’s', 'right', 'privacy', 'transformation:', 'digitalization', 'challenges']"
A Novel Data Mining Study to Spot Anomalies in Organizations: A Human Resources Management Case,2016,"Organizational behaviour is one of the most important assets of an organization; it may increase business value and profitability.Although it comes to life itself with the sector's contribution, leadership, environment, market conditions and competition, unemployment etc., there must be some ways to lead or direct an organizational behaviour.However, it is not practical to monitor and control organizational behaviour in detail with bare eyes.Technology-wise, we are not away from building a system to learn, understand and monitor the organizational behaviour and give alarms or signals to top management when the system perceives an extraordinary condition.This is doable with machine learning algorithms which is a model of Artificial Intelligence (AI).In the literature, there are plenty of machine learning algorithms that have been proved that they work or learn very well.Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms may be used to learn organizational behaviour and detect anomalies in the behaviour.In this paper, we propose a novel system to build a data warehouse with the data available in an organization and design it for learning the organizational behavior by machine, i.e. computers.The system we propose may be used to spot daily, weekly or monthly changes in organizational behaviour.These changes may have positive or negative effects on the performance of organizations, so this system may also be used as a decision support system for top management.When necessary feedback is given to the system, it may also develop or learn new features to interpret the effect of the change on the organization's overall performance.The system may also be used to compare the changes in organizational behaviour every year.Nevertheless, it is a useful tool to track, learn and monitor the interactions of each employee in the system.In the study, human resources management has been used as a sample model to detail the proposed system.","['novel', 'data', 'mining', 'study', 'spot', 'anomalies', 'organizations:', 'human', 'resources', 'management', 'case']"
METROLOGICAL CONTROL OF SENSORS FOR MONITORING WORKING CONDITIONS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,2024,"Metrological control plays a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data collected as part of the working conditions monitoring. It helps to prevent potential errors and guarantee the quality of the results, which is critical for the efficient assessment and management of occupational health and safety. The article aims to investigate and analyse the role and importance of metrological control of sensors in the system for monitoring working conditions at production facilities using artificial intelligence. The article examines the possibilities of using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise metrological control and analysis of sensor data. The authors provide specific applications of AI to improve the metrological control of sensors and identify the advantages and challenges of introducing AI into the metrological control system at production facilities. These tasks will help to reveal the essence and potential of using AI in the metrological control of sensors for monitoring working conditions and emphasise its significance in improving the safety of workers.

Workplaces of Today and Tomorrow to Attract and Retain Top Talent: Challenges and Opportunities with Remote / Hybrid Practices,2024,"The face and nature of the workplace are changing; remote work technologies and the capabilities of artificial intelligence are having a transformative effect on traditional norms of work performance, to which both employees and managers must adapt. The article analyzes the advantages and problems of remote work, its impact on staff turnover and retention, the sources and specifics of industrial stress during remote work, and the problem of environmentalization of workplaces with this format of work organization. The basis of the study was the results of an electronic survey from November 2023 till March 2024 of 40 specialists from the public and private sectors of South Florida (USA) who studied a postgraduate course in personnel management regarding their views, expectations, and preferences for onsite, remote and hybrid workplaces. Respondents gave answers to both closed and open questions to analyze the answers to which content analysis and inductive coding were used. 54% of respondents work in traditional offices, 32% can work remotely, and 14% of respondents have a hybrid work format. Analysis of the answers to the open questions allows us to determine the desired organizational culture format as flexible, remote/hybrid, positive, belonging/inclusive, work-life balance, and employee-oriented. The majority of respondents consider workplace design to be an essential determinant of labor productivity. Technologies for monitoring employees’ working hours for office, remote or hybrid work formats are different, and it is necessary to respect the employee’s right to privacy (20% of respondents consider regular monitoring appropriate, 50% – periodic, and 30% consider monitoring inappropriate). Organizations that organize a comfortable format of remote work for their employees are more likely to be able to attract and retain a talented workforce at a lower cost than those that require the presence of employees in the office (over the next decade, only 10% of respondents are willing to prefer working in the office, then as 90% – hybrid or remote work option). Based on the survey results, a list of criteria a company must fulfil to attract and retain talented employees and the characteristics of the most attractive work environment was formulated.","['workplaces', 'today', 'tomorrow', 'attract', 'retain', 'talent:', 'challenges', 'opportunities', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'practices']"
"DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE FIELD OF HR PROCESSES: DIRECTIONS, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES",2022,"The purpose of the article. The development of provisions regarding the formation and use, directions, problems and opportunities of digital transformation in the field of digitalization of HR processes in business under modern business conditions is considered. The article examines the peculiarities of the development of digitalization in the management of the development of personnel potential among domestic enterprises, which requires the application of the experience of foreign countries, which are focused on business optimization, effective IT solutions, and ensuring the quality of personnel. The main directions of the development of management systems in the conditions of digitalization of management are determined, such as: promoting the acceleration of innovative initiatives, prognostic monitoring of the market environment, assessment of factors affecting the company's competitiveness, development of road maps based on industry priorities and customer experience. Along with this, the formation of personnel potential, complex synchronization of all types of activities, development of culture and competencies of information exchange, modernization of IT systems, application of analytics and Big Data are considered. An organic combination of digital HR with mobile applications, social networks, cloud technologies, virtual reality, artificial intelligence to create favorable conditions for improving the work of employees, recruiting and firing personnel, etc. has been determined. Methodology. Digital transformation of HR is a change in the functioning of HR through the use of data in all areas: payroll, performance management, learning and development, profit, compensation, motivation and recruiting. The data on the priorities of HR specialists regarding investments in recruitment activities are shown. As can be seen from the statistics, corporate websites are considered the most important element of recruiting, while the application tracking system is the next priority. Results. Implementation of human resources management strategy is an important stage of the strategic management process. For it to be successful, the organization's management must adhere to the following rules: first, the goals, strategies, tasks of personnel management must be carefully and timely communicated to all employees of the organization in order to obtain from them not only understanding of service personnel management of the organization, but also informal involvement in the implementation of strategies, in particular, the development of obligations of employees to the organization to implement the strategy; secondly, the general management of the organization and the heads of the personnel management service must not only ensure the timely use of all necessary resources (material, equipment, office equipment, financial, etc.), but also have a plan for implementing the strategy in the form of targeted guidelines for the state and development of labor potential and record the achievement of each goal. Digitalization is a necessary process of development of modern enterprises in the conditions of the neo-economy. It is designed to simplify and speed up work with large databases, to ensure the automation of all types of activities (main and auxiliary operational, investment, financial), to improve communication with customers, suppliers and partners and all institutions of the external environment, to form new principles of interaction within the enterprise – between divisions, employees, management, transition to new organizational forms of management. Practical implications. Today, the development of ICT (digitalization) is a factor that changes the pace of enterprise development. ICT contributes to the increase of the motivation of employees, development of their creative thinking, also allows to save working time, multimedia tools and interactivity contribute to a better presentation and, at the same time, the information presented is also assimilated. Modern ICT maximally changes management methods – workplace, type of activity, interests, circle of partners. It is appropriate to single out the following means of mass introduction of fundamentally new ICTs, which caused qualitative changes in enterprise management: mainframes; personal computers; Internet; specialized global networks; cloud computing; Internet sensors, etc. Using all the opportunities of ICT and turning them into a real competitive force becomes the main task for managers. Value/originality. Updated practices, supported by a new type of manager with a new way of thinking, help to strengthen and develop innovative teams. In terms of capabilities, HR provides digital transformation by offering technologies capable of monitoring workforce performance in real time, implementing innovations, and ""using feedback to make informed decisions by managers"". Digitalization of society has radically changed people's lives and opened up new opportunities in the field of HR. At whatever stage of digital development each individual organization is, the strategy of people management and IT personnel occupy a central place in its strategic priorities, which determines the conditions for long-term development. The digital transformation of HR affects all types of businesses, from the largest corporations to the smallest micro-firms. It includes the transition from long-standing and traditionally used resources, tools and processes (such as filing cabinets and contact lists) to digital means of information storage.","['digital', 'transformation', 'field', 'processes:', 'directions,', 'problems', 'opportunities']"

Chapter 10 Artificial Intelligence in HR: Employee Engagement Using Chatbots,2024,"In the augmented reality epoch, employee engagement (EE) under human resource management (HRM) has become a vital frontier intended to teach a better quality of work life instilled in a responsive and responsible workplace environment, improve business operations, enhance performance and productivity with competitive, sustainable, organizational and financial outcomes for any business organizations. Ahead of the conventional way of engaging employees, HRM needs to progress with a new trend of digital transformation, such as artificial intelligence (AI) using Chatbots in employee engagement, as the millennial workforce expects every pace of their life to be interspersed with the digital mesh effortlessly, which is imperative for the success of an individual as well as corporate companies. The primary objective of this chapter is to explain how employees engage using Chatbots in organizations and highlight how virtual technology has reconfigured human resource organizations. The book chapter presents how virtual technology transformation guides organizational effectiveness extensively by engaging in different tasks and responsibilities like the engagement of employees, talent approach execution, succession-making plans, tracking operations, transactional case monitoring, recruitment procedure, robotics automation, Chatbots (AI), staff planning, analytics, worker banding control, rewards, and engagement by the HR functional area. Along with the same, HR departments of many professionally managed companies also comprehensively stressed the significance of Chatbots in maintaining industrial relations, particularly the working class members and their families, also considered for many beneficial transactions. These HR techniques would shape many organizations to achieve excellence in enhancing all kinds of efficiencies by applying digital technologies. The digital transformation tools and practices in the areas of AI help and support in providing and managing the exchange of information between the company and stakeholders in general. Chatbots offer many benefits to employees related to identifying the right talented leaders, proffer required training, recruitment and selection process, performance evaluations in a candid approach, and finally, help to increase the careers of all classes and grades of employees, which in turn competently leads to enhance all kinds of dexterities of the workforce.","['chapter', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'employee', 'engagement', 'chatbots']"

Deep Aging Clocks: The Emergence of AI-Based Biomarkers of Aging and Longevity,2019,"First published in 2016, predictors of chronological and biological age developed using deep learning (DL) are rapidly gaining popularity in the aging research community. These deep aging clocks can be used in a broad range of applications in the pharmaceutical industry, spanning target identification, drug discovery, data economics, and synthetic patient data generation. We provide here a brief overview of recent advances in this important subset, or perhaps superset, of aging clocks that have been developed using artificial intelligence (AI).

We provide here a brief overview of recent advances in this important subset, or perhaps superset, of aging clocks that have been developed using artificial intelligence (AI). Recent advances in machine learning (ML) (Box 1), coupled with increases in computational power and availability of the large publicly available datasets, have led to a renaissance in AI. These advances have generated substantial investment and hype, and many data scientists and companies are exploiting the surge in AI hype for promotional purposes. This has sown confusion in the market and triggered criticism from scientists working in the pharmaceutical industry, where approval in clinical trials is the ultimate measure of success.Box 1Applied AI AlgorithmsMachine learning (ML) refers to data analysis tools that can extract dependencies from the data without being explicitly programmed, thereby providing an attractive alternative to other approaches in areas where few or no prior data are available about those dependencies or where they are too complex.Deep machine learning or deep learning (DL) comprises a set of methods that rely on deep architectures with cascades of multiple layers, and include architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), deep reinforcement learning, and others.DNNs are models with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. The multilinearity of DNNs combined with non-linear activation functions provides them with exceptional ability to extract complex dependencies in the data and automatically select features that are most relevant to predictions. In the case of the age prediction, networks are trained using biological data as the input to predict age as accurately as possible.GANs are a type of a DL model that comprises discriminator and generator networks. A generator produces a candidate vector of synthetic data, and a discriminator networks check the vector validity. Such data generation has been extensively explored for new pharmacological agents, and can also be used to generate synthetic data for patients.Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of goal-oriented algorithm that is trained to attain a complex objective over many steps. In case of drug discovery, such an objective could include the drug-likeness of molecules, their ease of synthesis, and other desired properties. RL algorithms could also be deep and have a multilayered architecture.

In case of drug discovery, such an objective could include the drug-likeness of molecules, their ease of synthesis, and other desired properties. RL algorithms could also be deep and have a multilayered architecture. Most of the credible advances in the field have been in DL and reinforcement learning (RL) (Box 1). Since 2013, DL systems have surpassed human performance in multiple applications, including strategy games as well as image and text recognition. In healthcare, DL systems outperformed human dermatologists, ophthalmologists, and radiologists in various tasks. DL also demonstrated significant improvement over conventional ML methods in biomedical data analysis [1.Mamoshina P. et al.Applications of deep learning in biomedicine.Mol. Pharm. 2016; 13: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2.Aliper A. et al.Deep learning applications for predicting pharmacological properties of drugs and drug repurposing using transcriptomic Data.Mol. Pharm. 2016; 13: 2524-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar]. During this same period of DL progress, aging research has also experienced a renaissance, and new breakthroughs are rapidly emerging. Multiple data types can be used to predict age and associate the prediction with mortality, disease, general wellbeing, or other biological processes including methylation, gene expression, microbiome, and imaging data [3.Xia X. et al.Molecular and phenotypic biomarkers of aging.F1000Res. 2017; 6: 860Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar]. Since the publication of the first multitissue methylation aging clock by Steven Horvath in 2013 [4.Hannum G. et al.Genome-wide methylation profiles reveal quantitative views of human aging rates.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 359-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar], multiple methylation aging clocks and applications of these clocks in humans [5.Field A.E. et al.DNA methylation clocks in aging: categories, causes, and consequences.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 882-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar] and mice [6.Meer M.V. et al.A whole lifespan mouse multi-tissue DNA methylation clock.Elife. 2018; 7e40675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar] were developed. Even though these clocks were developed using traditional ML approaches – notably linear regression with regularization and the use of a limited number of samples – the results suggest that gradual changes during aging can be tracked using various data types with reasonable accuracy. In 2015, advances in DL and aging biomarker development began to converge. AI researchers at Insilico Medicine recognized that DL requires very large datasets, and that the most ubiquitous feature among varied and incompatible biological datasets is age. Age is a universal feature of every living organism and object on the planet. It is also the most biologically relevant feature because it is most strongly correlated with mortality, a broad range of diseases, and remaining quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Although it can be difficult to correlate any individual feature with age, the combination of many features can be very predictive. A human can guess with reasonable accuracy the age of another human using low- and high-resolution imaging data, movement patterns, or even scent and touch. Surprisingly, many patterns are similar in other species and can be used for cross-species analysis, and transfer learning techniques can be very helpful for research. For example, a human who is shown a macaque for the first time in his or her life is often able to classify it correctly into one of three age brackets: young, middle-aged, or old. In ML this technique is called 'zero-shot learning'. After seeing 100 macaques of varying ages, a human is able to achieve much better accuracy. This technique is called 'one-shot learning'. The same techniques may be applicable to learning biological processes by using age as a feature and then retraining on various diseases with few available datasets or cross-species comparisons. There are many challenges in classifying aging as a disease in the traditional biomedical paradigm [7.Zhavoronkov A. Bhullar B. Classifying aging as a disease in the context of ICD-11.Front. Genet. 2015; 6: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar], but treating aging as a process with >100 stages for the development of deep age predictors helps to capture a broad set of biological processes in a holistic way. Although the study of the classical methylation aging clocks did not uncover many similarities between mice and humans [8.Stubbs T.M. et al.Multi-tissue DNA methylation age predictor in mouse.Genome Biol. 2017; 18: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.Petkovich D.A. et al.Using DNA methylation profiling to evaluate biological age and longevity interventions.Cell Metab. 2017; 25: 954-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar], the application of AI and multiple data types may help with cross-species research. A crowdfunded and crowdsourced project called MouseAgei attempts to develop a photographic biomarker of aging in mice with the aim to apply transfer learning to other animals, and possibly to humans. The effectiveness of this approach remains to be seen; however, there are clearly many features that are common in rodents and even humans that can be observed by the naked eye, and DL may help to uncover these similarities. The realization that changes during aging can be tracked has led to the search for a biologically relevant data type that has abundant historical datasets as well as a small number of highly variable but standardized features that can be easily anonymized. Using one of the broadest panels of routine blood tests performed in multiple countries in a standardized way, the first aging clock study utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) (Box 1) was published by the laboratory of Zhavoronkov in 2016 [10.Putin E. et al.Deep biomarkers of human aging: application of deep neural networks to biomarker development.Aging (Albany). 2016; 8: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar]. The scientists utilized over one million clinical blood tests (blood biochemistry and cell count) to generate from routine screening tests a dataset of over 60 000 reasonably healthy subjects annotated with sex and age. The proof-of-concept study demonstrated the basic application of evaluating the relevant contributions of each simple feature to the accuracy of the predictor. The abundant blood biochemistry data allowed comparison of the various ML models, and the DNNs clearly outperformed in every test. The deep hematological aging clock study was extended to several million subject records to evaluate the population specificity and biological relevance of these clocks in multiple populations, as well as the association of predicted age with mortality [11.Mamoshina P. et al.Population-specific biomarkers of human aging: a big data study using South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European patient populations.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2018; 73: 1482-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar]. In this study the three DNNs were trained on anonymized Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European blood test samples annotated with age. Testing Korean and Eastern European data with a DNN trained on Canadian data revealed that Koreans on average appeared younger than their chronological age, whereas Eastern Europeans looked significantly older, thus demonstrating population differences. In addition, through testing on an independent dataset, researchers found that the people predicted to be older had higher mortality rates than those predicted to be in line with their chronological age, confirming the biological and suggesting clinical relevance of the clock. Photographic imaging, a highly accessible and prevalent data type used in AI applications, has been explored by the research team at Haut.AIii, a company specializing in digital skin analysis [12.Bobrov E. et al.PhotoAgeClock: deep learning algorithms for the development of non-invasive visual biomarkers of aging.Aging (Albany). 2018; 10: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. The deep photographic aging clock, using only images of the corners of the eye, can predict the age of an individual within an accuracy of 1.9 years mean absolute error. Although photographic data are not the most biologically relevant, many genetic and phenotypic disorders can be diagnosed from a picture. For many applications, images are found to be more valuable than genomic data, and are even more valuable in combination with other data types. Photographs are also among the most abundant data types, and results can be validated and interpreted instantaneously by human experts, making images ideal for proof-of-concept experiments. Transcriptomic data are one of the most abundant but variable types of data. The evolution of microarray and RNA sequencing technology since 2000 has resulted in the production of millions of gene expression datasets from multiple tissues, and varying numbers of genes have been measured using different equipment in diverse experimental settings. Despite high variability, transcriptomic data are among the most valuable types of data because they enable the identification of the genes most implicated in specific diseases, such as cancer [13.Sager M. et al.Transcriptomics in cancer diagnostics: developments in technology, clinical research and commercialization.Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2015; 15: 1589-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar]. In 2018, the first transcriptomic aging clock developed using DL and other ML techniques based on gene expression data from muscle tissue was published [14.Mamoshina P. et al.Machine learning on human muscle transcriptomic data for biomarker discovery and tissue-specific drug target identification.Front. Genet. 2018; 9: 242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar]. The work presented several ideas on prioritizing specific genes as possible targets for pharmaceutical intervention in sarcopenia and other muscle-wasting diseases. Wearable and mobile devices provide a vast amount of biologically relevant data. In 2018, age-associated changes in physical activity were studied for the first time in context of age prediction using neural networks [15.Pyrkov T.V. et al.Extracting biological age from biomedical data via deep learning: too much of a good thing?.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar]. A DL-based model trained on activity-monitor data achieved a relatively high accuracy in predicting age, but showed lower association with mortality compared to a less accurate age-prediction model. To address this lack of mortality association, the authors proposed a DL mortality predictor as a tool for the identification of various health risks. In addition to expanding the scope of aging clocks, neural networks can be used to generate synthetic data in large volumes. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Box 1), a new ML technique first introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 [16.Goodfellow I.J. et al.Generative adversarial networks.arXiv. 2014; (Published online June 10, 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)Google Scholar] and now commonly used in drug discovery [17.Zhavoronkov A. Artificial intelligence for drug discovery, biomarker development, and generation of novel chemistry.Mol. Pharm. 2018; 15: 4311-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18.Polykovskiy D. et al.Entangled conditional adversarial autoencoder for de novo drug discovery.Mol. Pharm. 2018; 15: 4398-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar], enable the generation of biologically relevant synthetic data with specified conditions. Synthesizing new patient data using GANs trained on millions of samples, using only age as a generation condition, allows massive anonymization of data while maintaining the most biologically relevant features. It also enables the identification of potential targets that drive aging and disease-related processes [19.Zhavoronkov A. et al.Artificial intelligence for aging and longevity research: recent advances and perspectives.Ageing Res. Rev. 2018; 49: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]. The intersection of recent advances in AI and aging research yields many new tools and applications for the pharmaceutical industry to exploit – at every step of the R&D process as well as in personalization, marketing, and real-world evidence. Over a dozen of these possible applications are summarized in Figure 1. We highlight a few of these below. For pharmaceutical companies, multimodal age predictors (predictors that integrate multiple data types) at the very minimum can provide deeper insights into biological data management. Not all data types are of equal biological importance and relevance. Age predictors are excellent tools for a broad range of experiments. Deep aging clocks provide a simple way for a pharmaceutical company to evaluate which type of data is affected by a drug or intervention, leading to a clearer understanding of which data are most important in a clinical trial. Age predictors can also help to evaluate the quality of the data as well as their impact both on the accuracy of the predictor and on the importance of specific features. Multimodal age predictors enable the integration of previously incompatible data types, such as dynamic wearable data combined with photographic and tissue-specific gene expression data. Moreover, aging research is a broad multidisciplinary field that converges with many other scientific disciplines directed at age-related diseases [20.Zhavoronkov A. Cantor C.R. Methods for structuring scientific knowledge from many areas related to aging research.PLoS One. 2011; 6e22597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar]. Many interventions in immuno-oncology rely on the state of the patient's immune system and general health. Aging clocks may be used to track immunosenescence levels and identify new interventions designed to boost the immune system in the elderly. For companies specializing in vaccines and looking for immediate revenue gains from AI, aging clocks can provide a way to track response rates. If a meta-analysis of clinical trials demonstrates that patients predicted to be older than their chronological age respond better to an alternative dosage or vaccination protocol, then necessary additional doses of the vaccine may be sold. Multimodal aging clocks obscure the difference between aging and disease status, essentially turning the many aging clocks into a marker of the health status of an individual. Because all living beings change over time, multimodal aging clocks and clock ensembles trained on all accessible data types can act as a digital twin for a patient. This likeness can be moved forward and backward in time using GANs with multiple defined generation conditions, including lifestyle choices and interventions. These clocks may also be embedded into field-trainable mobile devices that learn on the individual and help to maintain an optimal biological age. In this article we highlight the convergence of AI with aging research and review some of the deep aging clocks that have been developed in the recent past. We also lay out the potential utilities of these clocks in the pharmaceutical industry. In the coming years we expect the convergence of AI and aging research to accelerate, given the emergence of longevity biotechnology as a standalone industry [21.de Magalhães J.P. et al.The business of anti-aging science.Trends Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 1062-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar] and the many players who are entering the field, from universities and non-profits to large corporations, investment funds, and startups. After the newly announced call by famed Silicon Valley incubation program Y Combinator to provide seed funding for extending longevityiii, several startups in data-driven longevity are sure to emerge in 2019 and beyond. Further, we see that large holding companies in longevity, including Juvenescence.AIiv, Longevity Vision Fundv, and Life Biosciencesvi, are also growing AI-powered longevity companies in an effort to find longevity interventions and complementary biomarkers that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such therapies in a clinical setting. P.M. and A.Z. are employees of Insilico Medicine, a for-profit longevity biotechnology company developing an end-to-end target identification and drug discovery pipeline for a broad spectrum of age-related diseases.

Determination of the impact of innovative technologies in the system of strategic management of corporate social responsibility,2024,"The object of research is the process of using innovative technologies in the system of strategic management of social responsibility of enterprises. The main problem solved during the research was the need for a more effective integration of the principles of social responsibility in the business strategy, which will help enterprises to adapt to the global challenges and demands of modern society. The study of new technological approaches in this area allowed to identify the most effective tools for increasing transparency, responsibility and sustainable development of companies. As a result of the conducted research, the content of the concept «innovative technologies in the system of strategic management of social responsibility of enterprises» was clarified, which is proposed to be understood as a modern approach to the integration of technological innovations into strategic management, aimed at improving the social indicators of the enterprise. These technologies are found to include a wide range of tools such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and others that help businesses effectively implement and monitor social programs and initiatives. It is substantiated that the use of innovative digital technologies in the system of strategic management of social responsibility of enterprises opens wide opportunities and generates significant advantages. Namely, increasing transparency and openness; optimization of resources and costs; increasing internal efficiency; strengthening of reputation and brand; automation of enterprise processes; innovativeness and competitive advantages; stimulating innovation. A model for determining the relationship between the level of profitability of enterprises by type: large, medium, and small enterprises and by the number of employees and their labor costs is proposed, which allows to establish the required number of employees for each type of enterprise.

Ethical Dilemma Decision Making Based on Personality: The Case of Installation of a Keylogger System,2021,"BACKGROUNDToday, we face society 5.0, which is the fifth stage of the four previous stages of the hunting society, the agrarian society, the industrial society, and the information society (Fukuda 2020).The fast progress of information and technology creates an unexpected explosion of digital data and emerging and growing cyberspace (Fukuda 2020).This condition force industry to work effectively and efficiently.Using artificial intelligence can be a solution.The use of artificial intelligence (AI), namely face recognition, chatbots, and robots in the industry, are common.It is to help us, human.At a certain point, artificial intelligent able to make autonomous decision making.Unfortunately, the urge of growing innovation is not supported with the thorough consideration of moral, societal and legal consequence.This gap creates a grey area for unethical conduct.One ethical dilemma in business regarding artificial intelligence is the existence of a key logger system.Keylogger system allows the user to captures typed character or number, including document content, password, user id, visited website, URL, and do a screen-shot (Tuli & Sahu 2013).In general, network monitoring might give the company several benefits, including protecting business secret formula / intellectual property; prevent sabotage and data theft; abuse through internet/email among coworkers; reduce workplace slackers; and improving efficiency and productivity (Tuli & Sahu 2013).A key logger system might improve employee productivity since it can check on employees' time on social media or nonproductive sites (Bhardwaj & Goundar 2020).Despite the company's benefit, the setting up of the key logger system makes the workers feel uncomfortable since their","['ethical', 'dilemma', 'decision', 'making', 'based', 'personality:', 'case', 'installation', 'keylogger', 'system']"
Using Artificial Intelligence in Employment: Problems and Prospects of Legal Regulation,2024,"Objective : to identify the legal problems of using artificial intelligence in hiring employees and the main directions of solving them. Methods : formal-legal analysis, comparative-legal analysis, legal forecasting, legal modeling, synthesis, induction, deduction. Results : a number of legal problems arising from the use of artificial intelligence in hiring were identified, among which are: protection of the applicant’s personal data, obtained with the use of artificial intelligence; discrimination and unjustified refusal to hire due to the bias of artificial intelligence algorithms; legal responsibility for the decision made by a generative algorithm during hiring. The author believes that for the optimal solution of these problems, it is necessary to look at the best practices of foreign countries, first of all, those which have adopted special laws on the regulation of artificial intelligence for hiring and developed guidelines for employers using generative algorithms for similar purposes. Also, the European Union’s and USA’s legislative work in the area of managing risks arising from the use of artificial intelligence should be taken into account. Scientific novelty: the article contains a comprehensive study of legal problems arising from the use of artificial intelligence in hiring and foreign experience in solving these problems, which allowed the author to develop recommendations to improve Russian legislation in this area. As for the problem of applicants’ personal data protection when using artificial intelligence for hiring, the author proposes to solve it by supplementing the labor legislation with norms that enshrine the requirements for transparency and consistency in the collection, processing and storage of information when using generative algorithms. The list and scope of personal data allowed for collection should be reflected in a special state standard. The solution to the problem of discrimination due to biased algorithms is seen in the mandatory certification and annual monitoring of artificial intelligence software for hiring, as well as the prohibition of scoring tools for evaluating applicants. The author adheres to the position that artificial intelligence cannot “decide the fate” of a job seeker: the responsibility for the decisions made by the algorithm is solely on the employer, including in cases of involving third parties for the selection of employees. Practical significance : the obtained results can be used to accelerate the development and adoption of legal norms, rules, tools and standards in the field of using artificial intelligence for hiring. The lack of adequate legal regulation in this area creates significant risks both for human rights and for the development of industries that use generative algorithms to hire employees.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'employment:', 'problems', 'prospects', 'legal', 'regulation']"

"A Machine Learning Web App to Predict Diabetic Blood Glucose Based on a Basic Noninvasive Health Checkup, Sociodemographic Characteristics, and Dietary Information: Case Study",2023,"Background Over the past few decades, diabetes has become a serious public health concern worldwide, particularly in Bangladesh. The advancement of artificial intelligence can be reaped in the prediction of blood glucose levels for better health management. However, the practical validity of machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting health parameters using data from low- and middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh, is very low. Specifically, Bangladesh lacks research using ML techniques to predict blood glucose levels based on basic noninvasive clinical measurements and dietary and sociodemographic information. Objective To formulate strategies for public health planning and the control of diabetes, this study aimed to develop a personalized ML model that predicts the blood glucose level of urban corporate workers in Bangladesh. Methods Based on the basic noninvasive health checkup test results, dietary information, and sociodemographic characteristics of 271 employees of the Bangladeshi Grameen Bank complex, 5 well-known ML models, namely, linear regression, boosted decision tree regression, neural network, decision forest regression, and Bayesian linear regression, were used to predict blood glucose levels. Continuous blood glucose data were used in this study to train the model, which then used the trained data to predict new blood glucose values. Results Boosted decision tree regression demonstrated the greatest predictive performance of all evaluated models (root mean squared error=2.30). This means that, on average, our model’s predicted blood glucose level deviated from the actual blood glucose level by around 2.30 mg/dL. The mean blood glucose value of the population studied was 128.02 mg/dL (SD 56.92), indicating a borderline result for the majority of the samples (normal value: 140 mg/dL). This suggests that the individuals should be monitoring their blood glucose levels regularly. Conclusions This ML-enabled web application for blood glucose prediction helps individuals to self-monitor their health condition. The application was developed with communities in remote areas of low- and middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh, in mind. These areas typically lack health facilities and have an insufficient number of qualified doctors and nurses. The web-based application is a simple, practical, and effective solution that can be adopted by the community. Use of the web application can save money on medical expenses, time, and health management expenses. The created system also aids in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in ensuring that everyone in the community enjoys good health and well-being and lowering total morbidity and mortality.","['machine', 'learning', 'predict', 'diabetic', 'blood', 'glucose', 'based', 'basic', 'noninvasive', 'health', 'checkup,', 'sociodemographic', 'characteristics,', 'dietary', 'information:', 'case', 'study']"
Effective Labor Organization «Remote» Employees: From Functional Tasks to Software,2021,"In the new realities of the world, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the paradigm of management and work organization in companies is changing.

The potential and pitfalls of artificial intelligence in clinical pharmacology,2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) involves using data and algorithms to perform activities normally achieved through human intelligence. AI and its key component machine learning contextualize data and enhance decision making to transform how we operate, discover, and develop drugs. Transforming clinical pharmacology (CP) as AI-augmented CP (AI/CP) requires an ecosystem including digitized data collection, standardized processes, complementary technologies, and an ethical framework. This commentary aims to highlight the future perspectives of AI/CP in drug development. For decades, clinical pharmacologists have embraced the mathematical representation of physiology and explored modeling options to derive relationships between drug and temporal changes in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics. Now, as an evolution toward defining better therapies, we strive toward more digitization. Digitized drug interaction databases, for example, consisted of curated qualitative and quantitative data related to various extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including comedications, excipients, food products, organ impairment, and genetics that can affect human systemic drug exposure. Besides, digital biomarkers (measured by means of digital devices such as portables, wearables, implantable) provide new and faster data in real time, giving clinicians a better understanding of how medication impacts the disease and its interaction with an individual's overall health. With recent advancements in collecting electronic health records and processing patient genomics data, digital twins and virtual populations are becoming achievable. With the development of natural language processing–like techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) models could use physician notes and laboratory books as data for predictive modeling. With the development of the Internet of Things (network of devices work together seamlessly connecting medical devices and databases), it is now possible to collect more electronic data than ever using wearable devices. The availability of curated databases, real-world evidence databases, patient-centric sampling, and futuristic wearable data would provide the foundation for AI/clinical pharmacology (CP) to develop and deliver life-changing medicine for patients. Our expectation for AI-augmented CP is to enable accurate predictions, drive making unbiased decisions, and provide efficient CP systems (Figure 1) to deliver the core part of the guidance to the prescriber (e.g., labels, summaries of product characteristics). In this perspective we focus on the intersection of AI and the field of clinical pharmacology with a focus on the potential impact of AI in these aspects: dose recommendations, drug interaction, variability in PK and patient stratification/selection. A dose-recommender system based on AI/machine learning (ML), which integrates data across domains including but not limited to multiple safety and efficacy measures, electronic records about current health status, information about the disease and previous treatment history, and patient-reported outcomes, would provide tailored dosing options for patients, enhancing efficacy and minimizing adverse events. Currently, reinforcement learning–based algorithms showed potential for dose predictions and dose modifications during treatment by precision dosing for oncology patients.1 The Dose–Response Network2 uses deep-learning (DL) approaches that can estimate individual patient outcomes at different intervals of dose–response curves. The ability of AI to recommend doses in counterfactual conditions is questionable. However, generative adversarial networks, with their ability to learn from current data and expand the learning to the unknown dose–response surface, could revolutionize individualized dose–response curve predictions.2 CP-based impact on prescribing information depends predominantly on studies evaluating drug–drug interactions (DDIs), drug–food interaction, bioavailability, and PK changes in special populations. However, this information is limited compared to the potential drug interactions in clinical practice and real-world settings. AI/CP can expand beyond the patient population evaluated in clinical studies. Innovative algorithms based on knowledge graphs (KGs) showed the potential to predict unknown adverse drug reactions,3 DDIs, and drug–food interactions.4 Bougiatiotis et al.5 demonstrated the utility of biomedical literature KGs and link prediction models to assess the DDIs in Alzheimer's disease and lung cancer. With the help of the KG framework, existing physiologically based PK (PBPK) expertise and data sources (see Digital and Data Considerations), clinical pharmacologists can project potential and dangerous DDIs due to simultaneous administration of multiple drugs. This provides opportunities to include both known and unknown (potential) DDIs in patient information leaflets. In clinical practice, therapeutic drug monitoring offers dose recommendations for drugs with relatively high variability in PK and a narrow therapeutic index. AI/ML has demonstrated better dose recommendations for propofol and remifentanil with less error in predicting bispectral index during anesthesia than traditional modeling methods.6 AI/ML approaches can now recognize patterns by identifying complex and nonlinear relationships and the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the variability of PK in different subpopulations. We envision that integrating ML capability with population-based approaches would help further explain PK variability and offer options to modify dose in subgroups of patients. US Food and Drug Administration guidance7 on clinical trial enhancement strategies suggest including patients with a high chance of showing a disease-related end point (prognostic indicators) and patients who are likely to respond to the treatment (predictive indicators). DL methods can handle the array of data (liquid biopsy, pathology imaging, computerized tomography scans, and extensive omics data) and understand/recognize patterns with the prognostic/predictive potential. Reduced population heterogeneity includes choosing patients with baseline measurements of a disease or a biomarker characterizing the disease in a narrow range. In contrast, excluding patients whose disease or symptoms improve spontaneously or whose measurements are highly variable would help to increase study power, reduce costs, and bring new medicine to patients faster. Decreasing variability often uses a process known as electronic phenotyping, which focuses on reducing population heterogeneity. Electronic phenotyping8 requires mining large databases of electronic health records and accounting for heterogeneity between patient records and data types. Applying AI technologies, especially ML and DL, to electronic phenotyping processes can accelerate the identification of eligible patients for clinical trials. Efforts to automate pharmacometric modeling and the development of neural network/neural ordinary differential equation–based predictive modeling and novel algorithm-based clinical trial designs (Table 1) lay the foundation for the future of model-based drug development (MBDD). We postulate that exploiting AI methods extracting information from unstructured data (e.g., imaging/electronic records) would enhance current approaches for MBDD by improving personalized projections and decision making across clinical trials. The potential to hybridize ML and pharmacological models helps ML to perform well in limited data scenarios and conversely the ML models help with improving misspecification of pharmacological models (Table 1). Meta-analyses of clinical and observational studies aggregate meaningful inferences supporting drug development, but these analyses are hugely time-consuming. However, with the combination of AI and human intelligence, Michelson et al.9 performed a rapid meta-analysis to generate insights indicating ocular toxicity as a side effect of hydroxychloroquine in a much shorter period (<30 min) than traditional meta-analysis. Similarly, unsupervised ML assisted with the automated screening and study selection process for meta-analysis.10 Efficient and rapid ML-based literature analysis could help with a well-informed comparative analysis in early clinical trials. A predictive modeling ecosystem including nonlinear mixed-effect models, mechanistic models, PBPK, quantitative systems pharmacology, AI/ML algorithms, structured/unstructured data, and ML-assisted meta-analysis would drive advancements in MBDD. Overall, a synergism in terms of efficiency and developing accurate predictive models are expected while integrating pharmacometrics and ML. In general, ML approaches use inductive reasoning, and the inferences are correlative, not causal. Furthermore, true causal-based understanding comes from applying deductive reasoning and the application of a scientific method. In health care, it is vital to understand the root cause of any changes (physiological, pharmacological) causally related to an underlying disease. In the absence of such knowledge, we may make poor medical decisions. Although AI in health care has promise, algorithms are trained on big and extensive datasets with high variability and imbalance, resulting in algorithmic bias. Several other avenues of data accumulation can import bias into the algorithm, including but not limited to differences in infrastructure used for data collection (e.g., wearable device data) and the quality of training provided for patients and practitioners for data collection. Regarding data privacy, much progress has been made with the influential ""General Data Protection Regulation"" compliance efforts. Most healthcare companies have more awareness of data privacy and structural components in terms of infrastructure and governance boards for data use. However, applying these tools in a clinical setting requires robust information technology platforms for commercial technology giants. To protect patient privacy and control the utility of data by third parties, strong data privacy regulation (across the globe) is required. Implementing AI tools in clinical practice requires further ethical considerations regarding data privacy and patient consent. Recommendations and guidance for using AI in clinical practice are scarce or nonexistent; from a patient perspective, patient consent for data usage and awareness of using AI for their life/health decisions needs well-formulated moral guidance. Rapid growth in digitization is the foundation for implementing AI in CP. With the transformation in data and digital systems, AI could help improve dose recommendations that are the core CP deliverable and improve the efficiency of pharmacometrics. Overall, the patient can benefit by expanding the CP section of the label (providing expected DDI and unknown adverse reactions). However, a lack of causal inference and ethical data-sharing issues must be addressed for a successful and thriving AI in CP. No funding was received for this work.

Influence of Artificial intelligent in Industrial Economic sustainability development problems and Countermeasures,2024,"Economic Sustainability Development (ESD) helps improve the sustainable values needed to conserve resources via optimum use, recovery, and recycling. There should be a direct relationship between countermeasures and the cause of economic losses due to improper design of ESD. Therefore, combining big data and cutting-edge technology may facilitate real-time monitoring, encourage consumers to engage in more sustainable practices and foster the development of industry sustainability. However, countermeasures have unforeseen consequences and tradeoffs that are difficult to predict in ESD. In this research, ESD uses big data to enhance their operations and customer service, develop targeted marketing strategies, and boost sales and profitability. In ESD, Data analytics is being used by human resources to improve decision-making throughout the recruiting process and in evaluating employee performance. In the long run, Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption may boost productivity and produce new goods, creating jobs and boosting the economy. AI may have a net beneficial impact on ESD. Therefore, ESD-AI helps to overcome the problems by minimizing costs and boosting the economy. AI-integrated ESD helps analyze vast amounts of data, which may increase the speed at which things are done and substantially enhance decision-making. Hence, a balanced approach is essential to guarantee that AI systems can tackle sustainability challenges without adversely compromising other aims to boost the economy.","['influence', 'artificial', 'intelligent', 'industrial', 'economic', 'sustainability', 'development', 'problems', 'countermeasures']"
Advanced Chatbots for Home Patients using AI,2023,"Artificial intelligence can be used to respond to chatbots' questions through textual or spoken interaction.

"The Invisible Health Care Professional: Exploring the Intersection of Data, Devices, and Artificial Intelligence",2018,"As a follow-up to my last column (Skiba, 2018), I want to speak to an emerging idea, that of the invisible health care professional. In one of the “Next Big Thing” talks at the Consumer Electronic Show 2018, which focused on the invisible doctor, the primary message was that the “digital health industry will take signals from all parts of our lives and integrate them into personalized care.” This talk (available at https://www.ces.tech/Conference/ConferenceProgram/Conference-Tracks/SuperSessions/Next-Big-Thing-The-Invisible-Doctor.aspx) led me to question how we are preparing future nurses for their interactions with future patients; in particular, I have been thinking about the future role of the nurse practitioner (NP) in the connected age of personalized care. As many of you know, the University of Colorado’s Drs. Loretta Ford and Henry Silver initiated the first NP program in 1965. Now, I wonder, how will the NP role evolve over the next decade with the intersection of data, devices, and artificial intelligence (AI)? THE CONTEXT A recent publication by Bazzoli (2018) identifies six trends that point to a revolution in health care. The talk about revolution in health care is not new — it seems to keep coming up — but I believe that one trend in particular is helping to catalyze this movement. As Bazzoli notes, consumerism is on the increase — more patients want control over their health records and are not just relying on the health care establishment, family, or friends for knowledge about their health. The Internet has unleashed knowledge so anyone can access information about health conditions and treatment options. Consumers are also collecting health data from their devices, tracking their activity, and even obtaining blood pressure readings on their watches. According to Bazzoli, consumers are paying a larger share of their health care costs, which, in turn, leads to higher expectations and greater demand for control. Just take a moment and think about your students. What expectation do your millennial, Gen Z, and iGen students have for their health care in the future? Bazzoli’s other five trends include business migration, price frustration, provider disintermediation, health concentration, and, lastly, data and technology affirmation. Business migration is something we see in the news almost on a daily basis: the opening of the AppleTM Health Care Clinic for its employees, for example (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/apple-launching-medical-clinics-for-employees.html), and the new partnership between JP Morgan Chase, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway to launch their own health care company (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-health-care.html). Think about all those digital tools that were showcased at CES 2018 entering into the health care market (Skiba, 2018). As part of the CES panel on “The Next Big Thing,” Paul Sterling, vice president of emerging products at UnitedHealthcare, talks about incentives for employees who are willing to be monitored when wearing an activity-tracking device. The MOTION project (https://www.uhc.com/employer/programs-tools/for-employees/unitedhealthcare-motion) provides a monetary incentive to the employee’s health savings accounts each day the tracker is used. Price frustration is a no brainer. Despite all the advances in health care, health care costs continue to skyrocket. Provider disintermediation is an interesting trend. In the past, traditional providers served as gatekeepers, maintaining the knowledge base and providing service. You had to go to the provider’s office to get care. But remember what Sarasohn-Kahn (2018) says, “The new front door for health/care will be the patient’s home front door.” As Bazzoli points out, there is more value in optimizing health than in trying to charge more for sick care. For nurses, the focus on promoting health, as opposed to caring for the sick, is not a new trend. The last trend, data and affirmation, has the greatest potential to impact health. The more data that can be collected, verified, and distributed, the better one can receive the right care at the right time and the right place. Health data, whether collected by a health care institution or by the individual, will facilitate better decision-making. THE INTERSECTION OF DATA, DEVICES, AND AI Although electronic health records allow us to collect and store patient data to facilitate decision-making, we are still trying to maximize their use and minimize provider frustration. There is still a disconnect with the need to pull data from various sources — inpatient records, primary care visits, urgent care visits — to get a complete picture of the patient’s health. Many electronic health record systems are still struggling to add the social determinants of health and genomic data to support health care delivery. Despite these issues, health care organizations have managed to access data and use data for predictive analytics. Big data, data science, and data visualization are terms that consistently appear in the health care literature. They speak to the need for health care organizations to harness the power of data. Perhaps the most interesting and plentiful data are those being collected between health care visits. Leaf (2018), writing in Fortune, cites Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini, who notes that, of the more than 6,000 waking hours people have per year, most spend, on average, just 20 hours in health care: “So 99.7% of the time that we’re living our lives and being impacted by the world, we’re not in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital.” But in that 99.7 percent of our time, we collect a lot of data that will directly impact our health, for example, our sleeping patterns, our activity levels and sedentary activities, and our nutrition data. Each time you add a digital tool to your life, you are amassing more and more data points. Also writing in Fortune,Fry and Mukherjee (2018) provide a good synopsis: “More specifically, it’s your data: your individual biology, your health history and ever-fluctuating state of well-being, where you go, what you spend, how you sleep, what you put in your body and what comes out. The amount of data you slough off everyday — in lab tests, medical images, genetic profiles, liquid biopsies, electrocardiograms, to name just a few — is overwhelming by itself. Throw in the stuff from medical claims, clinical trials, prescriptions, academic research, and more, and the yield is something on the order of 750 quadrillion bytes every day — or some 30% of the world’s data production.” All these data have existed for many years, but we did not know how to harness the data deluge and turn it into meaningful information for decision-making. “But now, thanks to a slew of novel technologies, sophisticated measuring devices, ubiquitous connectivity and the cloud, and yes, artificial intelligence, companies can harness and make sense of this data as never before” (Fry & Mukherjee, 2018). AI pops up everywhere. Reporting on the HIMSS 2018 national conference, Winey (2018) cites Pamela Peele, who thinks the new buzz around AI is “because we have dense, robust algorithms, tons of data and the ability to handle it computationally. It's the perfect storm.” For example, IBM’s Watson is being used to help diagnose and care for oncology patients. View the video at https://youtu.be/8_bi-S0XNPI and read about Watson and oncology at https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/oncology-and-genomics/oncology/). There are a number of other examples: The Babylon app uses AI to provide online consultations (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600868/the-artificially-intelligent-doctor-will-hear-you-now/). Patients report their symptoms, which are compared to a knowledge base of illnesses. Molly is a digital nurse that can help monitor chronic conditions and provide episodic care (www.sensely.com/#about). Boston Children’s Hospital has developed KidsMD™, which provides basic health information and education using Amazon’s Alexa technology (https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/bch-bch041116.php). An example funded by the National Institutes of Health is the AICure app (https://aicure.com/), designed to optimize patient behavior and medication adherence. With the intersection of data, devices, and AI, who will be your health care professional in the future? Will your health care provider partner with you as an invisible AI assistant? Will it be Molly, your virtual digital nurse? Or will it just be the invisible AI wizard on your smartphone? Fry and Mukherjee (2018) talk of Daugherty’s prediction of “information asymmetry.” Patients that own their health data have been able to harness that power and be more in control of their health. Nurses will not disappear in the future, but their roles and responsibilities will change. Here are some suggestions to get you up to speed as an educator. Educate yourself in the use and application of digital health tools. Schedule a visit with your local health care facility or a virtual visit at a distance facility. Think about the data deluge that will be facing nurses and how to prepare your nurses to be better data managers. Learn more about data science, data visualization, and AI so you can be prepared to address questions as they arise and begin to introduce these topics in your courses.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Institutional Performance: The Variable of the Intellectual Capital Broker in Commercial Banks operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,2024,"The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) with its dimensions (expert systems, automatic machine learning, usability) on organizational performance, mediated by intellectual capital, in commercial banks operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study population comprised all employees in commercial banks in Saudi Arabia, and the study relied on a proportionate stratified random sample of administrators in these banks (managers, department heads, supervisors, administrators), totaling 338 administrators. The study utilized a descriptive-analytical methodology, developing a questionnaire consisting of 38 items. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The study yielded several key findings: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence, with its dimensions (expert systems, automatic machine learning, usability), on organizational performance. Additionally, there is a significant impact of artificial intelligence dimensions on intellectual capital, and intellectual capital significantly impacts organizational performance. Moreover, there is a significant indirect impact of artificial intelligence dimensions on organizational performance through intellectual capital in commercial banks. The study recommended that bank management focus on expert systems provided by artificial intelligence to acquire knowledge from stored databases for problem-solving and application through organizational performance and intellectual capital. It also suggested developing systems to logically and programmatically address accounting errors to enhance the ability to automatically monitor and reevaluate internal processes continuously in line with changes in the external work environment. This can be achieved through the use of modern technology, knowledge transfer, research, and development.","['impact', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'institutional', 'performance:', 'variable', 'intellectual', 'capital', 'broker', 'commercial', 'banks', 'operating', 'kingdom', 'saudi', 'arabia']"
The Commercial Determinants of Violence: Identifying Opportunities for Violence Prevention through a Public Health-Based Framework Analysis,2024,"Violence has immediate and long-term repercussions for the health of individuals and communities. Recent increases in the understanding of public health approaches to violence prevention have focused on the policies and practices of government, health, and other public sector agencies. However, the roles of commercial bodies in fostering and preventing violence remain largely unaddressed. The wealth and influence of some companies now exceeds that of many countries. Consequently, it is timely to explore the roles of commercial processes in violence. Using a conceptual framework for the commercial determinants of health, we examine seven practices: political; scientific; marketing; supply chain and waste; labor and employment; financial; and reputational management. We include areas directly linked with violence (e.g., firearms) and those that indirectly impact violence through the following: design and promotion of products; employment practices; and impacts on environment, poverty, and local resources. A range of avoidable commercial behaviors are found to increase levels of violence including the following: lobbying practices; distortion of scientific processes; polluting manufacture and supply lines; poor employee protections; financial investment in organizations and regimes associated with violence; and misleading communications and marketing. We conclude commercial actors can take action to ensure their workers, clients, suppliers, and distributors help prevent, not promote, violence. New technologies such as artificial intelligence are transforming corporate processes and products and offer opportunities to implement violence prevention through commercial developments (e.g., monitoring online content). International regulation of commercial behaviors is needed to prevent interpersonal and interstate conflict and harms to health and trade.","['commercial', 'determinants', 'violence:', 'identifying', 'opportunities', 'violence', 'prevention', 'through', 'public', 'health-based', 'framework', 'analysis']"
The influence of self-management information technologies on the efficiency of the company,2023,"The article describes the concept of self-management, analyzes the role of modern information technologies in the company's efficiency, compares mobile applications for management, defines requirements for a mobile application for self-management, and creates a concept of a mobile application for a manager. Recently, the importance of self-management research has been growing in Ukraine. This becomes especially relevant due to the crisis situation in the economy and the lack of traditional management in our country. This problem attracts a lot of attention. Progressive companies increasingly attach importance to the creative potential and initiative of each employee, which contributes to a deeper study of psychological and sociological aspects of management and promotes the development of self-management as a new direction of management. A mobile application is, in fact, a business in a phone. With the help of special mobile applications, the manager receives all the necessary information about current affairs in the company, the performance of tasks by employees and personal planned tasks. The field of mobile applications for business will always be relevant and have the potential for development. For example, artificial intelligence can be integrated into a mobile application in the future. Modern information technologies can significantly simplify the manager's work in the process of managing the company and the process of self-management. With the help of a mobile device with special software, a modern manager can receive information about the level of satisfaction with the work of employees. The manager also receives consolidated information about the state of the company's activities and basic performance indicators. Based on the indicators, the manager can make certain decisions and immediately in the program itself set a task for specific employees to perform. The proposed mobile application concept will allow the manager to combine company management with self-management and employee management. The manager will be able to monitor the performance indicators of employees and the company in general and, if necessary, adjust activities in order to increase the efficiency of the company's activities.","['influence', 'self-management', 'information', 'technologies', 'efficiency', 'company']"

The purpose of the article is to determine and consider the effectiveness of the use of interactive technologies in the process of training students in advanced training programs for a technical profile. The authors have analyzed the domestic and foreign experience of colleagues in the application of innovative teaching methods; based on their own practical experience, the conditions for optimizing the educational process through the use of training complexes have been established; the obtained results are studied. The following are identified as priority areas in the development of digital industrial security technologies at oil and gas facilities: employee training (interactive training through VR), automation of production processes, video surveillance and video analytics, biometrics, recognition, movement monitoring and positioning, artificial intelligence, integrated solutions, computer simulators, information modeling, peripheral computing, etc. On the basis of the work done, the undoubted advantages of using training complexes in the process of training employees of oil and gas facilities have been established: a high degree of student involvement; «presence effect» in an identical problem situation; interactive nature; maximum immersion in a problem situation; isolation of the user from external stimuli; the ability of the teacher-trainer to control and coordinate the actions of the student.","['peculiarities', 'training', 'specialists', 'complex', 'enterprises', 'basis', 'digital', 'technologies']"
Complying With the First Law of Robotics: An Analysis of the Occupational Risks Associated With Work Directed by an Algorithm/Artificial Intelligence,2020,"It is increasingly common for companies to use artificial intelligence mechanisms, which may be more or less advanced, to manage work, that is, to establish work shifts and production times, design and allocate tasks for workers, recruit workers, evaluate performance and dismiss employees. Companies rely on technology to gather all the information available, process it and make the management decisions (productivity optimisation) that will benefit them the most. This replaces human supervisors and middle managers, as well as experts in human resources, leaving the management of workers in the hands of automated processes directed by algorithms – or in its most advanced stage, to be undertaken by artificial intelligence.This work examines the health hazards that the new forms of technological management can cause. Indeed, constant monitoring through sensors, the intensification of work derived from decisions taken by a machine without any empathy or knowledge of the limits of human beings, the reduction in the autonomy of the worker subject to decisions made by artificial intelligence, discrimination despite the mantle of algorithmic neutrality of those decisions and possible operating errors can all end up causing serious physical and psychological health problems for workers.These risks can be reduced if they are taken into account in programming the algorithm. This study defends the need for a correct programming of the algorithm to ensure it takes these occupational risks into consideration. That is to say, in the same way that supervisors must be trained in risk prevention to be able to carry out their work, the algorithm must be programmed so that it weighs up the risks in the workplace – and if this programming does not exist, steps must be taken to prevent the algorithm from being used to direct workers. Specifically, the algorithm must be transparent, adapted to the real capabilities of workers and leave them some margin of autonomy and respect their privacy. In short, the algorithm must assess any element that poses a risk to workers' health and safety. Hence, it is defended that mandatory risk assessment, carried out by specialists, should be incorporated into the programming of the algorithm so that it is taken into account when making decisions regarding work management.","['complying', 'first', 'robotics:', 'analysis', 'occupational', 'risks', 'associated', 'work', 'directed', 'algorithm/artificial', 'intelligence']"
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN HR: MODERN TRENDS IN HR MANAGEMENT IN RUSSIA,2024,"The digital revolution in human resource management (HR) has changed hiring procedures and the entire network of contacts between employers and employees. This is especially important in Russian conditions, when a large number of enterprises actively use advanced technologies to optimize their personnel procedures. Automated systems save time on repetitive processes such as document management, resume selection, and candidate pre-selection. This allows HR professionals to focus more on strategic aspects of their business, such as talent retention and corporate culture development, but, in addition to its advantages, digitalization also creates new difficulties. One of the main disadvantages of working with candidates and employees is the possibility of losing personal contacts. Since artificial intelligence analyzes huge amounts of data and draws conclusions using algorithms, it can significantly improve the recruitment process. However, its application is fraught with ethical problems. Algorithms can be biased or misinterpret data, which can lead to discrimination or incorrect choices. Thus, HR specialists continue to play a crucial role in monitoring automated procedures and ensuring impartiality and fairness towards candidates. Thanks to digitalization, the analysis of employee data opens up new opportunities. By collecting data on employee productivity, engagement, and satisfaction, HR analytics solutions allow you to more accurately predict business requirements and create customized HR management plans.","['digital', 'technologies', 'modern', 'trends', 'management', 'russia']"
Revolutionizing nursing education and care: The role of artificial intelligence in nursing,2024,"One of the primary applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing is patient monitoring. AI-powered monitoring systems can continuously collect and analyze patient data, such as vital signs and patient behaviors.1, 2 These systems can detect subtle changes in a patient's condition, alerting nurses to potential issues before they become critical.2, 3 Remote monitoring allows nurses to keep a closer eye on patients, improving early intervention and reducing the risk of complications.4-6 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that has various applications in various fields, including medicine. It is possible to automatically connect sensors and devices to patients without human intervention through the IoT. A wireless body area network (WBAN) is an IoT subdomain which provides the possibility of monitoring vital signs remotely. In the medical field, WBAN consists of a small network of sensors, such as pulse oximeter, gyroscope, spirometer, global positioning system, and electrooculography. RPMs are used to continuously receive clinical data from patients through internal and external sensors and help physicians make appropriate decisions. The main stages of RPMs include the following: (1) Data collection: data such as (vital signs, EEG, ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) continuously using non-invasive techniques and Invasive techniques are reviewed. (2) Data transfer and storage: All data is collected and transferred to the cloud for analysis, sorting and processing. (3) Support systems: Data are analyzed and used to help clinicians make decisions. Implanted sensors: sensors that are implanted inside the patient's body (under the patient's skin). External sensors: sensors that are directly attached to the patient's skin. Cloud Computing and Fog Computing are the two systems used in storage server. RPMs have many advantages, which can be mentioned as follows: Provide patient assurance, Increase patient awareness and responsibility, Provision of low-cost solutions.5 The application of RPMs is mostly in the field of cardiac arrhythmias, hemodynamics and vital signs.6 Remote patient monitoring systems can be used in relation to various chronic diseases such as heart disease, fall detection, mental health, diabetes. In the field of heart diseases, it is possible to measure and collect heart rate, breathing rate, ECG, breathing rate through wearable sensors. Studies presented a fall detection system based on wearable and environmental sensors, which is of great importance in the elderly. In case of abnormal data, health care professionals and family would be notified. In the field of mental illnesses, systems that remind patients of the dosage of drugs at a certain time, and monitoring adherence to drugs were used. These systems have been used in Alzheimer's and bipolar patients. In the field of diabetes, these systems were used to evaluate the patient's blood glucose level, the amount of food consumed, and the patient's blood pressure.5 AI is also improving the management of electronic health records (EHRs). AI algorithms can extract valuable insights from these records, aiding nurses in making informed decisions about patient care. AI-driven predictive analytics can identify trends and risk factors, helping nurses anticipate patient needs and tailor interventions accordingly.5-7 During the last decade, the use of AI has grown in health data, which are mainly multimodal (EHR, medical imaging, multi-omics and environmental data). Artificial intelligence has led to transformation in various fields such as health education reaserch. Thanks to the advances in AI and machine learning (ML) models, multimodal data fusion with different features can be achieved. Integrating imaging data with specific laboratory test results and demographic data leads to improved outcomes.8 As EHR data is complex and contains diagnosis, scans, laboratory test results, administrative notes doctor's signature it is difficult in working with EHR data. Because of this complexity, researchers use the combination of AI and EHR. Artificial intelligence components such as natural language processing and deep learning are mainly used in this field. Artificial intelligence can be used to analyze medical history, family history and diseases related to genetics.9 For example, AI in cardiology was used with EHR data for early diagnosis of heart failure, to predict the onset of congestive heart failure, and to improve risk assessment in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.10 The large volume of electronic clinical and imaging information creates a great dilemma for physicians in decision-making.11 With the advent of modern technologies such as AI, doctors are able to interpret heterogeneous medical data and make more accurate and efficient decisions. The availability of large collections of EHR data and the widespread adoption of EHR systems by health care organizations have made its application more feasible.12 Many hospitals are already using AI technology and trying to become “smart” hospitals.13 The combination of clinical data in EHRs, combined with the ability to analyze this data with AI, leads to a better understanding of the disease and better decisions.14 Administering the correct medication at the right time is crucial in nursing. AI-powered systems can assist in medication management by verifying prescriptions, checking for potential drug interactions, and even automating the medication administration process. This reduces the likelihood of errors and enhances patient safety.5 AI-based decision support systems at all stages (e.g., prescribing and dispensing) have already been proven to enhance patient safety by enabling error detection, patient triage, and medication management. The use of intelligent algorithms leads to the reduction of medication errors due to human errors. Among the interventions, the machine category “computerized decision support system” is the most used, which is a technological software that uses patient data (including treatments and results) for clinical decision making.15 AI and ML techniques have enormous benefits for medication management, both in the hospital and in the community setting, from clinical decision support (CDS) to drug safety and toxicity. With their capacity to summarize large amounts of data, ML techniques can be used to support a medication management process such as prescription verification, by flagging aberrant prescriptions.16 Artificial intelligence creates new tools to adhere to the treatment regimen with the aim of improving the patient's health.17 AI smartphone applications (“apps”), smart phone have been used as valuable tools to assess and encourage medication adherence in studies. These software can be used to remind the dose of medicine and to provide the method and instructions for taking the medicine and lead to improved adherence and detection of non-adherence. Reminder systems have been used for medication reminders. For example, a reminder via SMS which leads to the support and empowerment of patients. Several trials showed increased medication adherence in patients who used technology compared to usual care. Increasing medication adherence leads to improved clinical outcomes in patients.18 Patient participation, generally defined as the ability and availability of patients to take a leading role in their health care; that e-health is often able to promote patient participation. Which is one of the health care priorities in the world today. Patients who actively participate in the process of managing their disease get better results. Because engaged patients are more likely than others to engage in preventive behaviors, self-manage their symptoms and treatments, and seek health information. The strategy of patient participation should be considered in the design of new technologies for health care. Otherwise, it will lead to patients not accepting new health technologies. Patients typically interact with dedicated web portals, online social networks, or mobile apps that help them manage their disease and consult with health professionals.19 Patient engagement platforms are digital health applications used to reach and engage patients throughout the self-care process. Common personal education plans include patient portals, mobile applications for Android/iOS platforms, and messaging chatbots that are easily accessible via smartphone, tablet, or computer. Patient engagement platforms can be used in various areas such as: providing educational content, sending reminders to follow treatment protocols, reporting pain scores and mobility levels, collecting or managing wound images, and recording and monitoring health outcomes.20 Patient portals examples are: MyChart Aethna communicator Mobile health applications examples are: GetWellLoop SeamlessMD MyMobility Force Twistle Pattern health Mobomo WellBe Conversa, tap cloud Chatbots examples are: STREAMD Conversa Memora health20 Nurse staffing and resource allocation can be challenging in healthcare settings. AI algorithms can analyze patient data, hospital census, and nurse schedules to optimize staffing levels. This ensures that the right number of nurses with the appropriate skills are available to provide high-quality care.7 The digitalization of health systems with AI affects the labor market and the way employees are managed. Such technologies provide the opportunity to achieve high levels of efficiency in managing and screening candidates or reduce the time to hire and overall recruitment costs. Such technologies offer the opportunity to achieve high levels of efficiency in managing and screening candidates or to reduce recruitment time and overall recruitment costs with such technologies. Digital technologies affect recruitment management practices. By providing a large amount of data and automating many steps, they help all stages of human resource management. On the other hand, AI tools greatly reduce the time spent on preparing the salary and employee benefits plan and allow them to focus on more strategic issues. Digitalization and AI lead to better economic and financial results. Despite the high cost of these technologies, they improve the overall performance of the organization, increasing productivity, employee retention, overall satisfaction, and efficiency and optimization of tasks. Optimization of resource allocation and cost containment is at the heart of the healthcare management debate. In this vein, new technologies play a key role in enabling companies to minimize costs.21 Transforming AI and big data into safe and efficient healthcare applications, services, and procedures involves significant costs and risks. While AI holds great promise in nursing, there are challenges and ethical considerations to address. Data privacy and security must be maintained, and nurses need adequate training to use AI tools effectively. There is also the concern of AI replacing human interaction in healthcare, which requires careful balancing.5, 22 One of the main reasons that can compromise patient data is cyber attacks.23 There are various ethical concerns that need to be answered. Who owns the data being mined? Are adequate measures taken to ensure the safety and confidentiality of patient data? Are users aware of the regulations and guidelines for the use of data and results generated by AI? Could the use of AI lead to greater disparities in health care based on racial or economic factors.18 Other things that can be addressed in the field of AI include: informed consent, Protecting human autonomy, Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest, Ensuring transparency, explainability and intelligibility, Fostering responsibility and accountability, Ensuring inclusiveness and equity, Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable.24 Artificial intelligence is reshaping patient care in nursing by improving monitoring, enhancing EHR management, ensuring medication safety, engaging patients, and optimizing resource allocation. As technology continues to advance, nurses and healthcare institutions must embrace AI as a valuable tool to provide safer, more efficient, and patient-centered care. Although it is necessary to consider the limitations and ethical issues of this technology. With responsible implementation and ongoing research, AI has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and the nursing profession as a whole. In an era of rapid technological advancement, AI has emerged as a transformative force in various fields, and nursing education is no exception. The integration of AI into nursing education is revolutionizing the way future healthcare professionals are trained and prepared for the complexities of the healthcare industry. Traditional nursing education often relies on textbooks, lectures, and clinical experiences, which, while valuable, can have limitations in terms of personalization and efficiency. AI, on the other hand, offers several advantages that are reshaping nursing education.25, 26 AI-powered educational platforms can assess the strengths and weaknesses of individual students and tailor learning experiences accordingly. This personalized approach ensures that students receive the support and resources they need to succeed. Education according to students' abilities and developing their talents is a necessary thing that cannot be achieved through education in the traditional way. The concept of personal training comes from “precision medicine,” which terms such as “precision training” and “personal training and learning” are used to refer to it. Personalized learning involves predicting student performance and providing feedback based on analysis of student learning profiles and retention patterns. Specific learning abilities, learning requirements and study goals are identified and analyzed in a personalized learning system, then content is presented based on them. This method is used to identify and better understand heterogeneity among learners with special difficulties and to adapt educational content to students' needs. Problem analysis to examine student needs is a key component of personalized learning. It is possible to design educational content that matches students' learning needs and preferences based on identifying and diagnosing their problems. Also, educational materials can be provided based on the past progress of students and educational gaps. The advent of computers and AI has greatly contributed to the expansion of personal learning. The advent of computers and AI has greatly contributed to the expansion of personal learning. This method can help eliminate students' learning problems and increase productivity in teaching and learning.27, 28 AI-driven simulations and virtual reality environments provide nursing students with realistic scenarios to practice their skills in a safe and controlled setting. This hands-on experience enhances clinical competence and confidence. Nursing educators can use virtual avatar applications, virtual game programs, and virtual teacher chatbots to deliver nursing education in academic settings. They can use these tools to simulate interactive clinical scenarios and increase students' understanding of specific nursing concepts. The use of these technologies leads to the fact that students can improve their communication skills with patients and the treatment team before entering the clinical environment, and it leads to an increase in their self-efficacy and self-confidence.25 Artificial intelligence can be integrated into nursing simulation training to increase realism and interaction and personalize the learning experience for students. Artificial intelligence can be used in various aspects of nursing simulation, such as virtual patient models, intelligent reporting systems, adaptive learning platforms, and CDS systems. Learners can self-learn without the need to be in the training place and without the need for the instructor to be present through simulation. The virtual patient model can mimic real clinical scenarios and it can show realistic physiological responses such as changes in vital signs, symptoms and behaviors. In this way, CDS can be provided for nursing students. Through these systems, students can be helped to strengthen critical thinking and clinical judgment skills by being exposed to complex and realistic patient care scenarios. These methods have countless advantages, including increasing realism and loyalty, improving student participation and active learning, personal learning, and an efficient mechanism for student evaluation and feedback. AI algorithms can tailor simulations to each student's individual learning needs by adjusting difficulty levels, providing personalized feedback, and tracking progress. Using these methods ultimately leads to saving time.29 AI can analyze vast amounts of healthcare data to identify trends, best practices, and areas of improvement. Nursing students can access these insights to stay updated on the latest research and evidence-based practices. Successful applications of AI have been made possible by increasing access to healthcare data and the rapid development of big data analysis methods. By means of AI techniques, it is possible to extract clinically relevant information hidden in a huge amount of data, which leads to better clinical decision making. By means of AI, it is possible to extract features from a large volume of health-related data and then use the obtained insight for clinical practice. Insights from AI can help doctors make better clinical decisions and judgments.30 The digitization of data has had a great impact on the responsibilities and work of healthcare professionals. In the new era, a lot of data is generated in the field of health, which is difficult to analyze. Therefore, powerful automated algorithms are needed to analyze and process useful information from healthcare data. This information helps health care professionals and doctors in finding the cause of diseases and providing better and cost-effective treatment to patients. Various AI technologies such as classification, regression, clustering, and correlation are used to analyze healthcare data to enhance the healthcare provider's ability to make decisions about the health of patients.31 Insights obtained from AI are used in healthcare, supporting clinical decision-making by facilitating complex, impractical or time-consuming tasks including prediction, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.32 AI-powered educational tools are available round the clock, allowing students to learn at their own pace and convenience. This flexibility is especially valuable for working professionals pursuing further education. Artificial intelligence has played a huge role in education, including increasing access, which has increased even more with the Covid pandemic.33 Covid-19 has caused a global shutdown of several activities, including educational activities, and this has resulted in universities turning to online learning as an educational platform.34 The use of AI in education has created an opportunity to break down the physical barriers created by national and international borders, because educational materials are now accessible on the Internet and the World Wide Web for online learning or using web-based learning platforms and the content is accessible to people all over the world. Better access to learning with AI is possible by removing barriers to learning, automating management and administrative functions in academic institutions, optimizing instruction and learning, as well as enhancing experimental or evidence-based decisions and initiatives in education.35 Smart tutoring platforms for distance learning are growing and along with the expansion of mobile technology, it provides exciting opportunities for students and professors.3 Artificial intelligence can also augment teachers' ability to monitor and support their students. AI can continuously assess student progress, providing real-time feedback and helping educators identify struggling students who may need additional support.26 Students are afraid of answering questions in the presence of others in the classroom environment and receiving feedback. With AI, students can feel comfortable making the mistakes necessary to learn and receive the necessary feedback individually and personally.3 Feedback is very important to identify learning goals and knowledge gaps. Students need to know how they are performing in order to take steps to improve their performance.1 AI allows students to track their progress, identify weaknesses, and receive immediate guidance for improvement. AI-assisted learning assessment can lead to a more objective, faster, more cost-effective assessment process and provide more extensive individualized feedback.36, 37 AI can evaluate students without bias and with high speed and accuracy.3 On the other hand, Assessment of assignments and tests usually takes a lot of time from professors who can use this time to prepare for class and respond to students. These platforms can tell us what action should be taken and when to improve the performance of a particular student.38 Despite these significant benefits, the integration of AI in nursing education is not without challenges. Ensuring data privacy and security, addressing concerns about job displacement, adapting to rapidly evolving AI technologies, long-term effects of AI-assisted learning on student performance, evaluating the impact of AI-driven tools on instructor student interactions, and exploring the ethical considerations of incorporating AI technologies in nursing education are among the key hurdles that educators and institutions must navigate.37 In conclusion, AI is reshaping the landscape of nursing education. By harnessing the power of AI, nursing programs can better prepare students for the dynamic and demanding healthcare industry. While challenges exist, the potential to enhance the quality of education and ultimately improve patient care makes AI a valuable tool in the future of nursing education. As technology continues to advance, embracing AI in nursing education is not just an option; it's a necessity for the next generation of healthcare professionals.

Embracing AI in Change Management,2024,"Abstract: This article discusses how organizations can leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to support rather than hinder change management efforts amid technological transformation. It first establishes a research foundation on common sources of resistance to change, such as job insecurity, lack of understanding, and lack of involvement. The article then presents examples of how AI can augment traditional change management approaches to systematically address each resistance factor. Specifically, AI enhances two-way communication through personalized outreach and question answering. It also enables immersive, dynamic training solutions for ubiquitous, experiential skill development. AI fosters wider participation and feedback while monitoring employee well-being and performance. By addressing causes of resistance at each stage, AI strengthens critical aspects of communication, education, participation, and support to build understanding of changes rather than apathy. The article argues leaders who view AI as an ally in change management will empower their workforce through disruption.","['embracing', 'change', 'management']"
Strategizing for Productivity Growth in Digital Economy,2024,"The solution of the issues of increasing labor productivity is significant at the state, regional, corporate and project levels. The purpose of the article is to form a systemic and conscious perception by senior managers of the role of digital technologies and modern methods of big data processing in solving the problems of increasing labor productivity, the importance of the strategizing methodology for finding and recording points of growth of added value at the enterprise. Based on the scientific works of Academicians Askar A. Akayev and Viktor A. Sadovnichy, a review of the predicted changes in the main subsystems of the World-System is conducted, it is shown that under these conditions the relevance of a comprehensive analysis that takes into account not only long-term trends, but also the interaction of all important factors: technology, demography, economics, sociosphere, politics, etc. increases many times over. The methodological basis of the study is formed by the fundamental laws and rules of the methodology of strategizing of Academician Vladimir L. Kvint. It is shown that the instrument for the practical implementation of the system of strategic management of labor productivity growth processes is digital transformation. The solution to the problem of increasing labor productivity is provided by the large-scale implementation of end-to-end digital technologies in the production life cycle, ensuring the convergence of human and intelligent machine labor - automatic execution of the overwhelming majority of routine operations and offering the best possible solution to a person. The process of managing the strategic process of increasing labor productivity consists of the following stages: monitoring and analysis of indicators; identifying potential growth points; building a digital model of the process and conducting simulation experiments; developing organizational and technical measures and creating a decision support management system. A decisive factor for enterprises seeking to increase labor productivity is the use of artificial intelligence to automate everyday tasks, which allows employees to focus on more strategic activities.","['strategizing', 'productivity', 'growth', 'digital', 'economy']"
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CONDITIONS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS,2021,"The paper investigates the theoretical and practical aspects of providing the corporate social responsibility in a digital economy. The digital transformation of economic activity necessitates a business response to fundamental new challenges and threats related to cybersecurity, privacy, copyright protection, blockchain, misinformation, ethical algorithms for artificial intelligence etc. The quantity and complexity of digitalization problems determines the need for a consistent and comprehensive approach to ensuring digital responsibility in economy. Corporate digital responsibility can be defined as a responsible and ethical using of digital technologies; forecasting the social, economic and environmental consequences of decisions made in the digital economy. The analysis of social reports and web resources of Ukrainian companies indicates that their potential of digital responsibility is limited to the digital skills transfer and partial using in communications with stakeholders. At the same time, there are promising ways of manifesting social responsibility of domestic enterprises: investments in digital infrastructure and education; using digital technologies to monitor the responsibility and business ethics of suppliers and contractors; digitalization of environmental management processes; protection of digital rights and personal data of customers, employees, partners; dialogue with real and potential stakeholders through digital channels. Foreign experience shows that it is efficient to form public-private partnership platforms in the field of digital responsibility and sustainable development. It is also appropriate for the government to develop and implement a strategy for the digital transformation, programs of economic and advisory support for digital social entrepreneurship; to form standards for assessing and reporting about corporate digital responsibility; to eliminate the institutional and legislative barriers to the digital economy development; to overcome the digital divide in society; to create algorithms for personal data processing and suitable digital platforms.","['corporate', 'social', 'responsibility', 'conditions', 'digital', 'transformation', 'economic', 'systems']"

Navigating the ethical and governance challenges of ai deployment in AML practices within the financial industry,2024,"The rapid deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices within the financial industry presents significant ethical and governance challenges that must be navigated effectively. As financial institutions increasingly adopt AI technologies to enhance their AML efforts, concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency emerge. This review explores the ethical implications of AI in AML and offers governance strategies to mitigate risks while ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks. One of the primary ethical challenges in deploying AI for AML is the potential for algorithmic bias. AI systems trained on historical data may inadvertently perpetuate existing biases, leading to discriminatory practices in transaction monitoring and customer profiling. This raises serious concerns about fairness and equity in the financial sector. Addressing algorithmic bias requires the implementation of rigorous testing and validation processes to ensure AI systems function impartially across diverse populations. Data privacy is another critical issue. The extensive data collection required for effective AML monitoring raises questions about the protection of sensitive customer information. Financial institutions must establish robust data governance frameworks that prioritize privacy and comply with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Ensuring transparency in how data is used and providing clear communication to customers about data practices is essential for building trust. Effective governance frameworks are crucial in navigating these ethical challenges. Financial institutions should adopt a multi-disciplinary approach that includes ethical guidelines, compliance measures, and risk management strategies. Establishing oversight committees can help ensure that AI deployment aligns with ethical standards and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, ongoing training for employees on the ethical use of AI in AML can foster a culture of responsibility and accountability. This review highlights the need for a balanced approach to AI deployment in AML, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and governance structures. As the financial industry continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be essential for maintaining trust, ensuring compliance, and leveraging AI’s potential to enhance AML practices effectively.","['navigating', 'ethical', 'governance', 'challenges', 'deployment', 'practices', 'within', 'financial', 'industry']"

Digitalization and hydroinformatics,2023,"In early 2022, within the framework of Singapore International Water Week (SIWW), we wanted to find out what well-established senior water professionals from all over the world considered to be the main likely water-related megatrends of the future. Toward this end, Peter Joo Hee Ng, the then Chief Executive of PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, and one of the world's most forward-looking heads of water utilities we have ever met, and us, sent a request to over 200 leading water experts from all over the world, requesting them to let us know what in their views were the three most important water megatrends of the post-2025 world. This was an open-ended request: the participants were not providing a possible list of megatrends from which they could select only three: they were to identify three without any prompting. Nearly 30% of the people contacted responded to our request. SIWW Secretariat thereafter consolidated all these responses under some broad categories. Not surprisingly, climate change, adaptation, and mitigation headed the list. It was followed by digitalization, urbanization, water reuse, and resource circulatory/circular economy. We selected the top three megatrends and had a special session during SIWW 2022 to discuss the implications of these megatrends to water resources management. To this end, leading world experts were invited to discuss the implications of the identified megatrends. The longer term plan is to consider specific regions of the world and assess how the selected megatrends are likely to affect water resources management during the post-2025 era in a synergistic way. Nearly 90% of data in the world has been generated during the past 2 years. With the extensive use of sensors and robots in the water sector, data generated in the coming years will increase exponentially. Until 1900, human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of the Second World War, knowledge was doubling every 25 years. Doubling time was reduced to 13 months by 2013 (Schilling, 2013). It is likely to double soon every 12 h, or even less. Storage cost per gigabyte of data was over $1 million in 1980. Now it is a fraction of one cent (Schwab, 2016). It is likely to be almost free in the future with new technological breakthroughs, which are on the horizon. In 2017, the cost of translating one million words, from Chinese to English, was nearly $1 million. Currently, it is approaching zero (Callanan, 2019). Instantaneous, near-zero-cost translation will facilitate significant knowledge sharing and use across languages in the coming years. This will, for the first time in centuries, challenge the pre-eminence of the English language as the preferred medium of knowledge dissemination and use. While knowledge and technology have advanced tremendously during the past two decades, the water profession is still giving too much attention to the experience and paradigms of the past, many of which have become increasingly ineffective, and some even completely obsolete. However, the comfort of the status quo and/or vested interests have kept in use at least 70+ years old paradigms like integrated water resources management and integrated river basin management, even though, for the most part, they have been ineffective for decades for nearly all countries (Biswas, 2004, 2008). During the current era of rapid advances in knowledge and technology, many water professionals and water institutions are often being overwhelmed by the magnitude and extent of the rapid advances in water-related developments. Many are often ignorant of the potential use of new knowledge and information to improve nearly all aspects of water management. Digitalization is one of several important changes in recent years to which a large number of water professionals and institutions have not given adequate attention, often because of sheer ignorance of its potential use to significantly improve existing water planning and management practices and processes. This is partly due to the fact that they are not familiar, or comfortable, with using these rapidly evolving developments. As water management becomes increasingly more complex with time, the use of digitalization and hydroinformatics will become important means to make it progressively more rational, efficient, and equitable. Sensors, robots, and other means of data generation are already producing massive amounts of data, which then need to be promptly analyzed and applied, to improve overall water governance. Modern technology and big data analytics are already helping water managers in numerous institutions, in many developed and a few developing countries to understand, appreciate, and use the information contained in large amounts of data, which then could be meaningfully deployed to find more appropriate solutions. To be really effective, the entire process needs to be complemented by good, transparent, and steadily improving policy frameworks. Equally, the water institutions must train, recruit, and retain experienced personnel to distill and translate the knowledge that may come out of big data analytics so that the knowledge can be promptly used. Water management is inherently a mixture of social, economic, technical, environmental and political considerations. Digitalization and hydroinformatics should feed information generated, and knowledge obtained, from all of these activities to make the decision-making processes more timely, relevant, efficient, and cost-effective. Water institutions should also formulate effective and implementable information and communication strategies to engage all appropriate stakeholders. Data-driven management and operational models are already contributing to new ways of finding more effective solutions to old problems by obtaining new knowledge and insights from the massive quantities of data collected and their speedy analyses. Rapid advances in sensors, computing powers, and artificial intelligence, as well as their steadily decreasing costs, are contributing to increasing more rational and efficient use of water, including resource conservation, reducing overall costs, and generally contributing to positive impacts on the environment, ecosystems, and societal welfare. As water management becomes increasingly more data-driven, as it will undoubtedly become in the future, the availability of reliable and high-speed internet infrastructure becomes an essential prerequisite so that managers can take full advantage of the process. This will also require, in addition to good, reliable and up-to-date digital infrastructure, compatible platforms where collected data can be stored and transmitted to wherever such data could be beneficially analyzed and used. It is equally important that decision makers have the capacity, knowledge, and inclination to use such new types of information. Our own first large-scale appreciation of the benefits of digitalization and hydroinformatics occurred when we visited, some two decades ago, hydropower plants in the far north of Finland. These were located in inhospitable terrains where normal facilities and services are generally scarce. When we first expressed our desire to visit these plants, we were informed that it can be organized only one day each week, and we must make an appointment so that an expert may be available to guide us. Having visited numerous such plants all over the world, we felt these requirements were, to put politely, somewhat strange! When we arrived in Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland and a city of some 60,000 people, we found that the hydropower dams in northern Finland are managed and operated from this medium-sized city. Data and pictures from all the dams were transmitted to a control centre in Rovaniemi. This is manned by trained and experienced personnel 24 h a day and 365 days a year. If the experts in the control room feel there is any sign of trouble, at any hydropower plant, a team of specialists is promptly dispatched to check out the nature of the problems and find and implement promptly appropriate solutions. The hydropower plants are open only 1 day a week for visual inspection and cleaning. On the other 6 days, they remain closed but all essential information is instantaneously transmitted to Rovaniemi where it is carefully monitored. The system has been working successfully for decades. Based on our current global knowledge of the operation and management of dams, there is no question that the Dadu River Hydropower Authority is probably one of the most advanced institutions in the world in terms of managing its entire hydraulic infrastructure through extensive use of sensors, robots, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. They are probably 5 years ahead of their nearest competitor in China or the rest of the world. This issue contains an important paper (Tu et al., 2023) from this Authority on intelligent operation and management of the Dadu River Basin. The Authority is developing a cascade of 28 dams in the mountainous region of Sichuan province, including the 312 m high Shuangjiangkou Dam. When completed, it will be the tallest dam in the world. The Authority is extensively using sensors, robots, high-definition pictures and sound, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and mobile internet, to collect, transmit, store, and analyze data constantly. High-definition photos and sound systems, backed by data collected, successfully enable remote site monitoring and scene understanding. Such developments can now effectively simulate physical on-site inspections. As of 2021, the Authority had 22,948 risk sensing points on the bank slopes of dams and reservoirs and hundreds of thousands of points monitoring more than 350 types of equipment. The Authority has successfully developed 128 common fault monitoring indexes for turbines, generator rotors, and transformers. Results of extensive digitalization and management reforms have been impressive. Between 2014 and 2021, the number of hydropower plants in operation under the Authority increased from 5 to 9, and the installed capacity more than doubled, from 5.6 to 12 GW. This was achieved with a reduction in employments, from 2498 to 2148. This means even though its installed capacity more than doubled, the number of employees was reduced by 14% and the productivity of its workforce increased by 75%. All these developments contributed to a profit increase of 35%. Such developments require fresh talents, with special expertise in new areas like data analysts and decision managers. More than 300 employees have been retrained and transferred to digitalization-related work. The Authority has established a big data service company, with new jobs, which provides needed services with regular data analyses, which are at the core of all intelligent units. The staff are continually innovating. This is contributing to the development of new knowledge management practices, including the creation of new operational algorithms, as well as continually improving existing algorithms and management practices. Sensors, robots, and artificial intelligence have given the Authority unprecedented new skills for problem-solving and helping it to continually improve operational and management practices. Not only Dadu River Hydropower Authority but also numerous other water-related institutions, both public and private, in several developed countries and a few developing countries, especially China, have made remarkable progress in recent years in terms of increased use of digitalization, hydroinformatics, artificial intelligence, and information technology, to significantly improve water management. There is no question that in the coming years, their use will increase very significantly. Like all major developments, such advances will have both benefits and costs. The nature of beneficiaries will be different, and, unless carefully managed, there will be winners and losers. Thus, it is essential that this transition process is managed carefully. Otherwise, there could be significant job losses. Technological innovations often have the potential to reduce overall employment in older areas, even though they invariably create additional employment in many new areas. For example, in the United States, at the beginning of the 19th century, nearly 90% of workers were employed or earned their living from agriculture-related activities. Today, this percentage is less than 2%. Such developments, of course, are not new. Nearly a century ago, the well-known economist, John Maynard Keynes (2010), warned that “due to our discovery of means of economizing the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses of labour.” Fortunately, up to now, society has managed this transition process reasonably well as a result of which the results have been overwhelmingly beneficial to the society as a whole. Furthermore, what has been observed thus far in the case of Dadu River Hydropower Authority is that water institutions will have to give considerable attention to ensure that likely redundant workers can be retrained in areas where new types of jobs may be available in the future where they could be gainfully employed. Institutions also have to provide a good working environment where people could be retrained and new talents could be attracted and retained. To the extent possible, all the negative impacts of digitalization need to be kept to a minimum for societal good. There is no question that digitalization has the potential to improve significantly how water is being managed at present in different water institutions. Once implemented, it is likely to radically transform how water will be managed in the future, and perhaps the very nature of individual water management components. Effective digitalization across any water institution will be one of the prerequisites if water security is to be achieved. While the benefits of digitalization are many, challenges faced by water institutions to operationalize it successfully are also significant. Currently, in most water institutions around the world, the different departments of any institution are responsible for collecting, storing, and analyzing the data on various items. The data are generally available on different platforms, in different formats, and stored differently. The reliability of data collected by different departments could vary. In addition, the various platforms may organize the data collected and stored differently so that their use can be constrained in the institution as a whole. It is not unusual that some departments of the same water institution may see others as rivals and there could be historical mistrust between them. This could mean consolidating all the data collected and storing them in a compatible platform may prove to be a complex, time-consuming, and difficult task. Furthermore, appropriate algorithms have to be developed for the platform software, which needs to effectively integrate data with pictures and sound. This would enable managers to diagnose emerging problems remotely and find solutions before they become serious. A few water institutions, like PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, have already made a good beginning. Its previous Chief Executive created a high-level position, the Chief Information Officer, whose tasks include: ensuring all data and information collected and stored are available to everyone in the institution and are in a compatible form so that they can be used by all. For most water institutions, in different parts of the world, this will not be an easy task but one that has to be accomplished if the full benefits of digitalization have to be harnessed for more effective water management.","['digitalization', 'hydroinformatics']"
Disease‐X: Accounting for the unknown,2023,"Gentlemen, it is the microbes who will have the last word. Currently, there are a large number of pathogens that are a potential threat to public health due to their attributes of causing an epidemic and the limitations in measures to control them. ""Disease X"" is a part of the list of such infections. The WHO says, ""Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.""1 Various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and prions, can potentially be pathogen X. Bacteria (including rickettsia) account for about 54% of more than 300 emerging infectious disease episodes documented from the year 1940 to 2004. This number concerningly includes drug-resistant bacteria. Viral or prion pathogens (about 25%), protozoa (about 11%), fungi (about 6%), and helminths (about 3%) are less frequent and are more often found to be evolving zoonotic infections.2 It has been noted as a global concern that the introduction of pathogens that are engineered, whether through laboratory mishaps or as a result of bioterrorism, can also result in a devastating Disease X.3 This reinforces the potential for a developed pandemic pathogen, a hazard that must be monitored. In its recent update, the WHO has decided to renew the list of priority infections that can give rise to outbreaks, and it is advised that they need close watch by countries over the globe. They also stated that a new disease, called Disease X, would be added to the list. The list was initially released in 2017, with the most recent prioritization being completed in the year 2018. Covid-19, Ebola and Marburg virus, Crimean-Cong hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Rift valley fever, Zika fever, Nipah and Henipaviral diseases and Disease X are all on the list at the moment. The updated list of pathogens is anticipated to be issued in the first few months of 2023. The list is designed to serve as a tool to address gaps in knowledge and to convey priority in view of research and development with a view that it will aid the development of investments in management options, including vaccines. WHO's executive director for the Health Emergencies Program brought to light that choosing priority infections and families of viruses for research and development and looking for measures to tackle them is crucial for a quicker and more efficient response to an epidemic or a pandemic. To emphasize this, he added that with noteworthy research and investments done before the Covid-19 pandemic times, it would be easier to come up with effective and safe vaccines within the desperate limitation of time.4 Looking at the ongoing trends, a majority of recent catastrophic onsets have involved RNA viruses, contradictory to the fact that viral pathogens only make up a small component of the pathogens responsible for emerging infectious diseases.5 HIV/AIDS, influenza virus, SARS-causing coronavirus, monkeypox, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and henipavirus outbreaks are among the recent viral outbreaks. The viruses that replicate within the cytoplasm are known to be more associated with spread. Limitations in transmission, special growth requirements, and availability of antimicrobials are thought to be the reasons for the lower risk of outbreaks from other pathogens when compared to viruses.5-7 Error-prone RNA viruses have evolved, allowing for great mutability, which allows them to evade host defenses. They can reproduce across a variety of host species. The recent spread of Ebola, Nipah virus encephalitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome make the role of wildlife zoonotic transmission evident. Furthermore, RNA viruses make up about 94% of zoonotic viruses that infect people.8 Zoonotic transmission is multifactorial and frequently takes place in areas where people interact with a variety of mammals. Changes in patterns of human use of land for agriculture, trading, raising of livestock, and travel facilitates human exposure to diverse wildlife and microbial environment, resulting in viruses having the chance to cross different species and leading to localized emergence.6 The PREDICT project by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has come up with a surveillance program to control viruses before they spread to humans and at a level where management strategies can be implemented. It focuses on regions considered as more likely o be involved in emerging infectious diseases, including Asia, central Africa, and regions of Latin America.7, 9 The transformation from self-limiting emerging episodes into persistent person-to-person transmission is driven by a combination of improved virulence and population dynamics. As an agency with lower funds and poor political influence, the WHO frequently loses to take prompt, decisive action to stop the spread of transmissible illnesses. WHO has come under fire for failing to respond to pandemics like the 2014 Ebola pandemic. According to research conducted to determine who should be held accountable for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the WHO may have contributed to the problem, but lack of cooperation from governments and delayed financing have also been identified as contributing factors.10 The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the scale at which these novel pathogens can be a threat and the mass destruction that they can cause. Despite not being the first to cause chaos on our planet, it most definitely won't be the last. This proposes the need to be prepared for the next upcoming novel or re-emerging diseases by bridging organizational inadequacies, identifying key infections and hazardous regions, and highlighting alleged risk factors. The need to significantly fund the monitoring, study, and management of newly evolving potential pandemic agents that may result in disease X is urgent. Creating new research Laboratories in all countries is very important. Funds should be distributed equally so that scientists from every part of the world can collaborate. ""Without laboratories, men of science are soldiers without arms,"" said Louis Pasteur. The emergence of a pandemic can be mitigated by controlling the following related risk factors; human activity close to wildlife, production of foods containing animal products with insufficient employee oversight, and an unclear chain of supply, vectors including insects and ticks, extremely high density of population, and limited inspection and laboratory capacity. The steps that can be taken to contain Disease X include a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach from local to global levels developing international guidelines to contain bioterrorism, taking advice from scientists without any political hindrance, travel restrictions, and screenings.3 The use of antibiotics should be controlled to reduce the chance of resistance. We should give more focus and funds to vaccine research and communicable disease-based research. Apart from infectious diseases, public health courses are equally important. All the universities in the world should incorporate public health and infectious disease courses. Students should be encouraged in these courses. The Medical Council of the country should recognize these degrees. Climate changes are also a big reason behind these outbreaks. Recently, globally people are showing concerns over climate change. Many conferences are being held on this topic. We should incorporate the steps and decisions in society, and we should observe these parts very strictly. We can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mitigate the disease outbreak. Joint efforts from scientists, public health experts, and epidemiologists all over the world to eliminate the disease within a particular time, mass testing, and contact tracing will be helpful. The creation, availability, and approval of acceptable countermeasures, principally vaccinations, and clinical trials that are necessary before and during the pandemic, accelerated with timely funding, will prevent a potential release of a novel virus or pathogen which is currently unknown.

Ambidexterity as the Response of Smart Industry 4.0 – Towards Better HR Practices,2022,"Abstract Due to the global labor market challenges, international companies react and adjust fast to these circumstances by implementing digital solutions into all business processes. Organizational ambidexterity is seen as the response of digital transformation and it can be divided into structural, contextual, and sequential dimensions. In this context, organizations representing the smart industry will need employees with specific competencies which let them meet technological challenges.This chapter aims to clarify the state of opinion on expectations towards, and preparedness for, the impact of Industry 4.0 on human resources management and the implementation of various types of ambidexterity in these companies. We have conducted interviews with key HR informants from manufacturing companies operating in Germany and Poland. We have found that Industry 4.0 has a significant impact on HR practices. In both international companies, various digital solutions in employee recruitment, development, and performance, have been implemented. There have also been mature examples in both companies of structural, contextual, and sequential ambidexterity.

Introduction The fourth industrial revolution is known as Industry 4.0 in most German-speaking countries. Different terms for this concept can be found in other countries, such as Smart Industry in the Netherlands or the Industrial Internet in the United States of America. Industry 4.0 is the production of goods and services with the help of technical components such as Big Data, Cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, social components like attractive workplace conditions and production components such as smart factories to increase the competitiveness of a country (Bulte, 2018). 50% of German companies are planning industrial networks, while 20% have already transitioned to the smart factory of Industry 4.0 which means that machines, people and production resources are in interaction (Bayraktar & Ataç, 2019). In Poland, digitalization of business process and automation in various sectors is in its infancy. The Polish industry is between reality 3.0 and 4.0. Specific solutions are introduced ‘locally’. A comprehensive approach is rare when the introduction of culture 4.0 simultaneously covers various levels and areas of the company's operations (Polski Przemysł 4.0, 2018). Thus, in a time of rapid, dynamic and unexpected social, economic and political changes affecting the global labour market (Przytuła, 2018), the companies must react and adjust fast to such challenges as Industry 4.0 which brings increasing automation and digitalization into management. Automation is the second most important strategic priority: 36% of companies plan to increase automation over the next 12 months through leveraging cloud computing and 13% by investing in RPA – Robotic Process Automation (Deloitte, 2016). The HAYS (2018) forecasts prove that nearly half (47%) of existing jobs are bound to be performed by machines within the next 25 years. Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 57% of jobs are at risk of automation in highly developed countries, while in the EU market it is about 54%. Digitalization is changing the organizational and functional structure of each company. This term means an ever-increasing use of technology and corresponding substantial changes in numerous domains of business and society. This notion is also true for human resource management (HRM) (Strohmeier, 2020). In this context, ambidexterity can be seen as a solution for digital transformation. ‘Ambidexterity’ comes from Latin and means ‘both (hands) right’, in other words being equally adept in the use of both hands. It is a concept that often comes up when companies restructure themselves to embrace digital transformation. Studies have shown, however, that organizations have to continuously reconfigure their activities to meet changing demands in their internal and external environments (Raisch & Birkinshaw, 2008). Organizational ambidexterity refers to the ability of an organization to both explore and exploit-to compete in mature technologies and markets where efficiency, control and incremental improvement are prized and also its competing in new technologies and markets where flexibility, autonomy and experimentation are needed (O'Reilly III & Tushman, 2013). Exploitation is associated with activities such as ‘refinement, efficiency, selection and implementation’, whereas exploration refers to notions such as ‘search, variation, experimentation and discovery’. Exploitation and exploration therefore require fundamentally different organizational structures, strategies and contexts (Raisch & Birkinshaw, 2008). In this context of digital transformation in companies, ambidexterity is considered as a modern organizational concept managing current strategical requirements as such innovation for new digital solutions vs. efficiency in existing processes in fast developing smart factories as Garaus et al. (2016) pointed. According to Andriopoulos and Lewis (2010), Schnellbacher and Heidenreich (2020) and Uotila (2018) the organizational ambidexterity long-term success depends on the ability to explore new opportunities and to exploit existing capabilities. A lot of research has been done on Industry 4.0 from a technical point of view, but there has been little research done on what it is meant for the workforce or society as a whole (Habraken & Bondarouk, 2017). According to Habraken et al. (2018), HRM research mainly focuses on how the HR function can acquire digital competencies or make use of technology in HR domains, such as using new technologies for administration (e-HRM), recruitment (video interviews, CV scanning systems), training (virtual reality glasses, or serious gaming) or performance appraisal (continuous feedback apps). However, the impact of technology on the future of work and consequently the role of HR is much broader and may lead to downsizing, restructuring the content of jobs, teams, or departments, decreased quality of work, working conditions, or employment relations. Also, a growing body of literature suggests organizational ambidexterity is influenced by companies' HRM practices (Malik, Sinha, Pereira, & Rowley, 2019) especially concerning individual knowledge and organizational capabilities. Schnellbächer and Heidenreich (2020) showed that ambidextrous knowledge offering (exploration) leads to higher performance in settings where radical innovations are required; in contrast, ambidextrous knowledge seeking (exploitation) leads to increase in performance where settings required incremental innovation. Fourné, Rosenbusch, Heyden, and Jansen (2019) revealed in their meta-analysis that high technology companies benefit from a special type of ambidexterity, that is structural one, which is discussed in the next section. Therefore, there is necessity for smart factories focusing on ambidexterity to balance the need of innovation vs. efficiency. Two transformation paths are under consideration for companies: organizational vs. individual ones (Mom, Chang, Cholakova, & Jansen, 2018). The central issue is how to transform the ‘context’ for ambidexterity in companies by changing their capabilities, that is organizational structure, culture, IT, processes/routines, leadership or employee competencies and behaviour. For building an ambidextrous organization, Stelzl, Röglinger, and Wyrtki (2020) identified these capability areas. These areas could be applied for running a situational analysis and defining the maturity level as a starting point for the transformation journey on the organizational level. For the employee level, Rosing, Frese, and Bausch (2011) argued that the leadership behaviour for implementing ambidexterity requires ‘two complementary sets of leadership behavior that foster exploration and exploitation in individuals and teams: opening and closing leadership behavior’. Zacher, Robinson, and Rosing (2016) showed in a field study that opening leadership impacts exploration behaviour of employees, whereas closing leadership influences their exploitation behaviour. Therefore, the HR is in charge of assessing the maturity level of ambidexterity and guiding through this transformation on organizational vs. individual levels. This requires, for instance, redefining the new role of HR to be fully engaged in running ‘old processes’, but facing new, digital and technological challenges. Kang and Snell (2009) propose that each component of intellectual capital (human, social and organizational) resides in both approaches of ambidexterity, creating unique configurations that are set to align the objectives and purposes of the organization. In ambidextrous organizations, this allows to seek co-existence of explorative and exploitative approaches and the management of several layers of intellectual capital. These processes require proper handling and effective interventions. Several researchers have highlighted the importance of HRM in assessing, developing, monitoring and influencing an organization's intellectual capital, Kang and Snell (2009) provide several configurations of how HRM can enable this in ambidextrous companies by promoting the practice areas of development (e.g. training, job rotation), employee relations (e.g. advancement, career planning) and performance systems (e.g. job design, performance appraisals) to achieve both stability and continuity. From an organizational point of view as Garaus et al. (2016) stressed the necessity for an integrated, ambidextrous HRM system which focuses on the exploration path, on employment practices and on the exploitation path, on work practices ending up in collaboration, knowledge integration and learning. The authors provide evidence that these practices do not need to be distinct or even conflicting, to accommodate ambidexterity, and argue that practices should be evolved in an integrated fashion to allow both approaches to connect and ensure the ability of the company to integrate knowledge. Similarly, Malik et al. (2019) illustrate how efficiency can be achieved by simultaneously adapting HRM practices seeking both continuity and adaptation. In doing so, HRM ensures that the intellectual capital can be re-aligned or re-configured through various practices at different levels to accommodate the explorative and exploitative requirements of the company simultaneously, especially in the context of global competition. Thus, we focused on the direct impact of Industry 4.0 on the HR function (recruitment, performance, talent management, development) through the lenses of the ambidexterity concept (Schnellbächer & Heidenreich, 2020) because the mandate of HRM is to guide and support organizational and individual transformation (Garaus et al., 2016; Stelzl et al., 2020). Best Practices for an Ambidextrous Organization Smart companies (companies with Industry 4.0, German term, see Pfeiffer, 2017) apply digitalization by implementing artificial intelligence (AI) for their business products and solutions. For the management, this means to think twice about optimizing established business processes with automation, artificial intelligence as well as creating new, disruptive innovation for new digital products in the digital age. On the one hand, digitalization helps to increase the process efficiency of these established business processes and core business competencies developed in an existing pattern. On the other hand, innovation is created by applying digitalization or even AI to invent new products and services via disruption (O'Reilly III & Tushman, 2013). What solution could we think of to integrate both aspects in working processes? This dual pattern of management in the current digital age is an important key aspect to add business value by applying organizational ambidexterity (O'Reilly III & Tushman, 2013). Ambidexterity focuses on both aspects of exploration (process efficiency) and exploitation (innovation) either within the teams along the business process or by defining separate teams for exploration and exploitation (structural ambidexterity). This creates a management perspective for driving digital transformation within the company. O'Reilly III and Tushman (2013) differentiate between three patterns of ambidexterity: structural, contextual and sequential. First, applying the most common pattern, structural ambidexterity means separating exploration and exploitation into independent business units. Beyond the business units for existing processes, an innovation hub is created to explore new disruptive business ideas in flexible units. Then, there is evidence of a positive impact on company's performance (Jansen, 2005). His study revealed that the structural differentiation on ambidexterity is mediated through informal senior team and cross-functional interfaces (Jansen, Tempelaar, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009). Fourné et al. (2019) emphasize this type for high technology companies. Second, contextual ambidexterity balances exploration and exploitation by making team members capable of creating a potential for efficiencies and be innovative at the same time, for example through simultaneous activities in one organizational unit. The success factors for implementing contextual ambidexterity pointed out by Birkinshaw and Gibson (2004) are the social support of the management and the high-performance organizational context with high achievement motivation of the staff. Third, sequential ambidexterity covers a temporal sequence of exploration and exploitation (e.g. one follows the other) which is applied in the new digital business opportunities. Less evidence for the increasing impact on performance was given (He & Wong, 2004), but Chou, Yang, and Chiu (2017) showed that sequential ambidexterity, as a temporal switching capability, is positively related to new product performance. The type of business strategy and absorptive capacity moderated the impact of the sequential ambidexterity on new product performance. The added value of different ambidexterity patterns depends on the organizational context in the light of industry 4.0 (see Pfeiffer, 2017). Based on the best practices in the literature of the subject, we illustrated this with three company cases from Germany. The first business example from ‘Munich Re’ goes for the structural pattern, the second case from ‘Trumpf’ focuses on the contextual pattern of ambidexterity, whereas the final example of the ‘BMW’ company presents sequential ambidexterity. ‘Munich Re’ as an Example of Structural Ambidexterity This re-insurance company with 40,000 employees and 52 billion Euro revenue in 2019 was founded in 1880. Dietl (Dietl, 2020) described in his article the case study of why the re-insurance company Munich Re has chosen structural ambidexterity: Munich Re offers insurances for catastrophes which are very rare, risk calculation is the essential mandate of everyday work which might limit creative thinking and innovation. The innovation for new products was limited because of some structural and cultural barriers. Therefore, the top management decided to set up cross-functional teams with up to 300 employees who were upskilled in agile working methods to understand customer demands. They worked in a very dynamic environment within an innovation hub close to the board. This structural ambidexterity ensures service excellence in existing business processes in the large corporation and resulted in a new organizational entity Munich Re Ventures, a new digital unit in a startup setting, and special technological units for the Internet of Things. Finally, a new spin-off stands for focusing on a niche, evaluating market opportunities, fast iterative processes (‘build, measure and learn’) and customer-centric focus. Beyond these structural changes, Dietl (2020) summarized the following success factors for more innovation at Munich Re: top management focus, freedom for disruptive innovation, long-term resource allocation and budget for innovation even in times of revenue losses because of COVID-19. The final management lessons learned are to acquire skilled employees, establish a culture for innovation and passion to experiment although the outcome is not yet predictable. ‘Trumpf’ as an Example of Contextual Ambidexterity The Trumpf company for machine tools, laser technology and electronics for industrial applications was founded in 1923 (Trumpf, 2021). The company is a market and technology leader in machine tools and lasers for industrial manufacturing. Software solutions pave the way to the Smart Factory. Hönl (2021) pointed that contextual ambidexterity has the advantage over structural ambidexterity to integrate the old and the new business perspective (traditional mechanical engineering practices vs. artificial intelligence) in heterogeneous, cross-functional teams in parallel for maximizing customer benefits. He also explained this type of ambidexterity as a dynamic, iterative, so-called agile development; the new role of ‘product owner’ within an agile team focuses on managing the technical content side and feasibility, while agile managers (former line manager) create the appropriate organizational framework, essentially by making it adaptable and facilitating continuous learning and collaboration across boundaries in the light of contextual ambidexterity. In Hönl's interview (2021), Duwe argued that new capabilities need to be combined with existing knowledge; therefore training on these capabilities is essential. Finally, Duwe (2018) summarized that this contextual ambidexterity is a key success factor for digital transformation, thus leadership behaviour should encourage thinking in both patterns in parallel. In consequence, the current business leaders apply contextual ambidexterity by flexibly switching their and their employees' mindset and capabilities between exploration and exploitation in the business processes, enabling the necessary frame for new work behaviour, tools and collaboration for their teams and employees, as in agile project management. The lesson learned from this case is to increase capabilities by developing skilled employees in interdisciplinary fields combined with an agile approach. ‘BMW’ as an Example of Sequential Ambidexterity Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW, is a German multinational corporation that produces luxury vehicles and motorcycles. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines. Birkinshaw, Zimmermann, and Raisch (2016) identified BMW as an example of sequential ambidexterity: ‘BMW's successful sequential alternation is its culture that encourages employees to critically reflect on their strengths; in the phase between 2006 and 2010, when front-line managers were working hard to optimize BMW's continuous profitable growth in its established model range, top executives began to meet with customers, industry experts, and researchers to discuss the future of mobility’. This is a good example of how different internal stakeholders dealt with sequential ambidexterity. Birkinshaw et al. (2016) summarized: ‘During exploitative phases, front-line managers rely primarily on seizing capabilities, whereas top executives emphasize their sensing capabilities to identify the right moment and prepare the organization for the shift towards an exploratory focus. Conversely, during explorative phases, front-line managers primarily deploy their sensing capabilities, while top executives emphasize seizing capabilities, to prepare the organization for a shift back to exploitation’. In a nutshell, BMW realized the sequential pattern less within a team focus and more with many stakeholder groups on different organizational levels. Overall, Luger, Raisch, and Schimmer (2018) criticized that ambidexterity is not the only best fitting solution for any strategical movement because this focus could result in defensive activities by the management if dynamic, transforming external forces in the environment are not taken into account. Luger et al. (2018) favours a continuum of exploration-exploitation with balanced resource allocations; in the long-term run, companies should focus on ‘capability-building processes (to balance exploration and exploitation) and capability-shifting processes (to adapt this balance to the changing requirements)’. In a current cross-country comparison, Bustinza et al. (2020) revealed in the product service industry that sequential exploitation-exploration pathway maximizes company performance, but the optimal tested pattern consistent across all the world regions (except Japan) is the contextual ambidexterity impacting company performance. In contrast, Clauss et al. (2020) showed in a survey-based study in German mid-sized engineering companies how ambidexterity, exploration and exploitation affect the self-assessed competitive advantage. They favoured an exploration strategy of innovation processes with radically new knowledge, products and services, linking this with strategic agility as only exploitation has not increased competitive advantage, whereas an ambidextrous strategy on its own could negatively impact the competitive advantage. However, our best practices focused more on structural ambidexterity which is an excellent entry point for the first implementation of ambidexterity on organizational structural level. Next, on the individual level, the leader and employee behaviour requires a transformation step in the direction of sequential or contextual ambidexterity accompanied by agile working methods. These agile working methods push the radical innovation like it was revealed by Clauss et al. (2020) and Trumpf (2021). To conclude, we argue that a hybrid integrative pattern of contextual and structural ambidexterity with flexible staffing and job rotation between organizational units, temporary project teams, is worth considering for a smart industry. Relying only on structural ambidexterity with an independent innovation hub is not enough. If organizational ambidexterity is implemented, there is a crucial issue of capability in terms of either allocating the resources to flexible business demands or developing employee capabilities progressing on the ambidexterity maturity level (Stelzl et al., 2020). HRM practices need to be flexible for both patterns of working along a continuum (Luger et al., 2018). Furthermore, HRM practices should extend their traditional services with add-ons for supporting the flexible explorative working style. In a nutshell, several HR practices are highlighted to stress the necessity for HRM adaptations due to digital transformation (Buisson, Gastaldi, Geffroy, Lonceint, & Krohmer, 2021; Seeck & Diehl, 2017; Shipton, Sparrow, Budhwar, & Brown, 2017). This research field is developing right now, so our discussion is more an outlook rather than a complete summary. Beyond this focus, HRM practices have to foster further current challenges for digital transformation within their companies. Hansen, Güttel, and Swart (2017) linked the ambidexterity theory with the HRM strategy and system in order to evaluate, within a company, which HR system is needed based on current strategic requirements (i.e. degrees of flexibility vs. innovation) and argued that four different HR systems (1–4) are required within the same company: (1) compliance vs. (2) productivity-based systems for exploitation needs or (3) collaborative vs. (4) commitment-based HR systems for exploration enhancement. Balancing ambidexterity in business, HR systems should apply the above solutions. Challenges for HRM There is a price to be paid in building HRM systems to serve and help the enactment of ambidextrous organizations, and the number of challenges to companies that seek ambidexterity are well known. Because ambidextrous organizations require parallel actions that may often deem incompatible, much time and resources are required to build the kind of HRM practices that can be effectively integrated to achieve company continuity and development simultaneously. In addition, HRM professionals should be endowed with a specific attitude and mindset that will allow them to boldly depart from typical traditional approaches or even remain inculcated in one approach. Therefore, preparation and the right frame of mind is required (Buisson et al., 2021). Moreover, an HRM system in an ambidextrous environment implies additional complexity, and with complexity come more uncertainties to deal with. Therefore, HRM professionals need to design and implement HRM systems to support work that requires dual capabilities, to allow the company to achieve ambidexterity (Ferraris, Erhardt, & Bresciani, 2019). Finally management support is required to enable a sense of involvement and participation that is required for employees to explore new ways of behaving while maintaining efficiency at work (Prieto-Pastor & Martin-Perez, 2015). Human resource professionals are concerned with overseeing the HR of organizations, which, through Industry 4.0, will be affected by technological tools and innovative technology (Jesuthasan, 2017). Technological disruption, robotics and automation threaten to replace low-skilled, routine jobs (Naudé, 2019). The increase in technological capability will not only cause an increase in unemployment but will also change the nature of work and the workforce because of the underlying trends in technology that accelerate job automation (Dhanpat, Buthelezi, Joe, Maphela, & Shongwe, 2020). Many scholars have examined various challenges of human resources management regarding organizational ambidexterity, including leadership (Cunha, Fortes, Gomes, Rego, & Rodrigues, 2019; Jansen et al., 2009; Nemanich & Vera, 2009), top management characteristics (Lubatkin, Simsek, Ling, & Veiga, 2006; Simsek, 2009; Smith & Tushman, 2005; Venugopal, Krishnan, Kumar, & Upadhyayula, 2019), employee motivation (Ahammad, Glaister, & Junni, 2019) and organizational culture (Wang & Rafiq, 2014). In a situation of ambidexterity, companies need to successfully combine different activities over time and space, and this brings enormous challenges for HRM, particularly in the matters of competency management (Buisson et al., 2021). Following Pfeifer's (Pfeiffer, 2017) argumentation, there is a global work reorganization for new capabilities of the workforces, either upskilling or downsizing employees, depending on the specific job families. O'Reilly III & Tushman (2013) argued to focus on dynamic capabilities and relocating these organizational capabilities by covering all three types of ambidexterity: ‘Leaders must be able to orchestrate the allocation of resources between the routine and new business domains’. There has also been substantial, though insufficient, research on human resource development as a challenge for HRM in the context of ambidexterity and smart industry. Specifically, vast research exists in examining exploratory and exploitative learning (Dixon, Meyer, & Day, 2007; Kostopoulos & Bozionelos, 2011). Thus, our attention is focused on re-training and new competencies required in an ambidextrous organization. These result from digitalization of various processes in an organization. On the one hand, digital technologies are employed to support operational HR practices, such as recruitment or compensation. On the other hand, the operational application of digital technologies implies a ‘liberation’ of HR professionals from the operational burden, and makes them focus on value-added strategic activities of HRM (Strohmeier, 2020). Implementation of Industry 4.0 will pose new challenges for re-training. This, in particular, includes the need to equip employees with certain competencies that are crucial in the current labor market. In the strategic document European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (Vuorikari, Punie, Carretero, & Van den Brande, 2016), the European Union underlines the importance of digital competencies with key components, such as information and data literacy to articulate information needs, to locate and retrieve digital data, information and content; communication and collaboration to interact through digital technologies while being aware of cultural and generational diversity; digital content creation to create and edit digital content; safety to protect devices, content, personal data and privacy in digital environments; physical and psychologic","['ambidexterity', 'response', 'smart', 'industry', 'towards', 'better', 'practices']"
Mental health and well-being at the workplace,2024,"INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) conceptualized mental well-being as a state where the individual is able to understand his abilities, cope with normal life stressors, work productively, understand his abilities, and contribute productively to the community.[1] Mental health and well-being are a broad concept with a primary focus on the health of the workforce.[2] Certain workplace factors, such as shift work, work demands, and work stress, can put an employee at higher risk of mental problems.[3] Impact of poor mental well-being at the workplace Poor mental health and lower well-being of the workers can lead to lower employee satisfaction, lower work performance, burnout, and increased risk of occupational hazards. As the workers are also part of the community, the effects of poor mental health can also affect the family and society. Higher mental health and well-being can lead to greater work productivity, more prosocial behaviors, increased creativity, increased longevity, improved physical health, and more positive interpersonal relationships.[4] According to the WHO, around 60% of the total world population is in work, of which 61% work in informal jobs. It is estimated that 12 billion working days are lost every year due to depression and anxiety and 50% of the total societal cost of mental health conditions is caused due to indirect costs, including reduced productivity.[5] Sociodemographics of workforce in India According to the annual report of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (July 2021–June 2022), published in February 2023, the worker–population ratio (WPR) in India is around 73.8 for males and 31.7 for females. The WPR is higher among the rural population, for both males and females, compared with the urban population.[6] The proportion distribution of workers in broad industries in India is presented in Table 1. While about half of the workforce is still employed in the agricultural sector, service sector and manufacturing comprise a quarter of the employed population in India. The same survey also suggests that among those with regular wages or salaries, more than half do not have a written job contract, and about half are not eligible for paid leave or social security benefits. The average hours per week of self-employed, regular wage or salaried employees, and casual laborers ranged from 40 to 50 hours.Table 1: Proportion distribution of workers in different broad industriesMigration for employment purposes is also a reality in India. It has been estimated through census data that of 27.4% of individuals who had changed residence, 8.8% moved for employment reasons and 2.3% moved for business motives.[7] Economic reasons were more common for migration to urban areas, especially for men. The migrant population, especially in the unorganized sector, faces multiple difficulties, including acculturation stress, physical hazards at the workplace, and uncertainty of job security. These difficulties were starkly brought to light during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.[8] Hence, we see that the workplace characteristics may be different in India as compared to some of the developed Western countries. The proportion of workers in the informal sector is quite high in India, which has a consequence on job security, insurance and other benefits, and the potential to have disability and pension benefits. The workplace characteristics also need to consider a large agrarian economy alongside a booming service economy and a gradually expanding industry. However, all of these are on the lower side of the value addition chain by global comparisons. Thus, the economic aspects of the workplace need due consideration for drawing inferences from the literature and recommendations about workplace well-being. Added to it are the cultural tenets of collectivism yet subtly creeping individualism at the social level. The young demography of the country with the dynamics of competition and espoused values of being ""settled"" as drivers of the employment market also has connotations for the Indian workplace well-being. Varied geographies, workplace patterns, literacy, avenues of social and economic mobility, and proclivities of migration (internal and external) are other factors that make unitary recommendations for well-being challenging in the Indian workplace. Hence, the present clinical practice guidelines take a pragmatic approach and suggest careful consideration of the mentioned factors before application. MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AT THE WORKPLACE Formal sector There is abundant literature on mental health and well-being at the workplace, especially related to the formal sector. We present some Indian studies on the epidemiology of well-being at the workplace. A study conducted by Manah Wellness among 1764 employees who were employed in white-collar jobs, residing in urban India in 2022, using the Emotional Check-In Tool, found that nearly 29% of the respondents showed moderate-to-severe signs of depression, 55% had moderate-to-severe signs of anxiety, and 78% had moderate-to-high amount of stress. However, despite this, around 99% reported moderate-to-high psychological well-being.[9] A review of various studies that assessed the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and mental illness in Indian workplaces found that a range of 10% to 52.9% of workers suffered from depression and a range of 7% to 57% of workers suffered from anxiety, while a range of 3.8% to 75.5% of workers suffered from workplace stress.[10] Another study conducted by Deloitte on mental health and well-being at the workplace among 3995 respondents across 12 industries found that more than 80 percent of respondents reported being affected by at least one adverse mental health symptom with depression being the most common symptom (59%), followed by emotional exhaustion or burnout (55%), irritability or anger (51%), sleep issues (50%), and anxiety (49%). The same survey also tried to find out the sources of stress among these respondents, and they found that workplace-related stressors were the most common (47%), followed by financial stress (46%), COVID-19-related factors (42%), family relationships (39%), and social connections (37%).[11] Another survey conducted by the White Swan Foundation for Mental Health among 800 workers found that despite more than half (56.0%) reporting mental health issues and nearly two-thirds (64.3%) reporting knowing someone at the workplace having mental health issues, only 24.6% felt that their workplace was extremely supportive for people with mental health issues and only one in four people received mental health support at the workplace. Furthermore, only one in ten people had access to Employee Assistance Program services.[12] Informal sector Though a large proportion of workers in India are employed in the informal sector, there is a lack of literature on the mental health concerns of the individuals employed in the informal sector. A qualitative study suggested that the structural, financial, and physical violence faced by women may have mental health consequences.[13] Another study among older individuals in the informal sector suggested that they suffer poor cognitive function more commonly than individuals in the formal sector.[14] Agrarian distress has been highlighted as a major source of mental health concerns for vulnerable farmers and is associated with farmer suicides.[15] Armed forces Individuals from the armed forces have also been exposed to significant stress that may result in mental health concerns. A study by Rao et al. (2008) found that about 28.8% of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel had high stress levels.[16] It was seen that those individuals posted in high stress areas were more likely to manifest symptoms related to mental health distress. Irregular work timings and inability to take leave were the most common workload factors related to stress. A study by Basavanna and colleagues in 1996[17] among more than 2000 police personnel found that 28.6% to 48% screened positive for having a psychiatric disorder, with depressive disorders and anxiety disorders being the more common ones. Among the armed forces, stress has been commonly reported.[18] There have been several instances of suicide (with 533 suicides and 15 cases of fratricide between 2007 and 2010). However, non-service-related reasons seem to be the important causes of suicides in this population. Medical health professionals Medical health professions are considered one of the most stressful ones.[19] Medical students, residents, and practicing physicians have high work-related stress, stress of the responsibility of human lives, attending to patients at different times, heavy workload, and the need to constantly update knowledge to keep abreast. This results in higher rates of depression, burnout, substance use disorders, sleep disturbances, and suicide than the general population. The reader is referred to the previous Indian Psychiatric Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (IPS CPG) for a detailed discussion on mental health issues among medical health professionals.[19] Factors affecting psychological well-being and mental health at the workplace Poor mental health and well-being are one of the major reasons for employees' poor performance at the workplace dropping out of work. The WHO has identified ten risk factors for poor mental health in workplace[20]: Work content or task design Workload and work pace Work schedule Control Environment and equipment Organizational culture and function Interpersonal relationships at work Role in organization Career development Home–work interface. A meta-analysis of seven longitudinal studies with 28431 participants found that shift work was associated with an increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes (effect size = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.74), especially for depressive symptoms (effect size = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.74). Gender was found to have a significant role in this, with female shift workers more likely to experience depressive symptoms than female non-shift workers and male counterparts.[21] A systematic review of nine studies that tried to assess the effect of employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures on the mental health of young workers found that exposure to contemporaneous sexual harassment was associated with the incidence of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, poor psychosocial job quality (low job control, high job demands and complexity, job insecurity, and unfair pay) was associated with depressive symptoms.[22] A cross-sectional study among 834 participants across 35 countries found that among patients with a diagnosis of depression in the past 12 months, 62.5% had anticipated and/or experienced discrimination in the work setting. Around 60% of the participants from high-income countries had stopped applying for jobs or training due to fear of discrimination.[23] Apart from these, other factors that have been found to affect the workers' mental health and well-being are past mental illness and family history of mental illness. A study found that perceived mental illness-related stigma among 228 nonprofessional occupational mental health staff was significantly related to the depersonalization domain of burnout.[24] Work from home—Benefits and disadvantages Work from home, especially propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, has positively and negatively impacted mental health and well-being.[25] Reduced time spent in commuting, flexibility of one's schedule, and more interaction time with friends and family were noted as major factors resulting in positive mental health outcomes. However, there is also a negative impact in the form of decreased work productivity, lack of access to a room where they could work independently, work–family conflict, increased sedentary behavior, and lack of opportunities for leisure. This has resulted in work from home being associated with depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties. Work from home has also been associated with an increase in alcohol consumption. ASSESSMENT Assessment by psychiatrists Often, individuals facing workplace stress have been referred to psychiatrists or may come on their own accord. Flowchart 1 may provide guidance for psychiatrists about addressing such individuals. In many cases, workplace stress, in conjunction with other life stressors, results in diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, such as depression. Therein, appropriate psychiatric management would be important, and suitable pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and brain stimulation techniques may be utilized. The individual may also require leave for a period of time for recuperation from his mental health condition. This should be done in accordance with the necessity in the case and would be applicable to psychiatric disorders faced. If there is a risk of harm to self and/or others, then the risk should be managed accordingly (refer to previous IPS Guidelines.[26,27] Sometimes, individuals may come with only workplace-based adjustment difficulties, which fall below the diagnostic threshold of a psychiatric disorder or may be classified as an adjustment disorder. Therein, assessing the workplace characteristics, the individual's work profile, coping methods, and other life circumstances are of value. Often, an interpersonal crisis may precipitate significant stress, resulting in the patient exhibiting symptoms of distress. Supportive therapy, counseling, exploring strategies to handle workplace stress, and symptomatic and time-limited use of medications to relieve insomnia could work. In situations of severe problems or recurring problems at work, change in the workplace, suggesting to report to management, or taking a break from work can be resorted to.Flowchart 1: Assessment of individuals with workplace-related issuesAssessment at the workplace The WHO does not recommend routine screening for mental illness in the workplace due to a lack of evidence for its benefits or harms. Yet, the assessment of well-being at the workplace has advantages for understanding the well-being status in a particular workplace location. There are several instruments to assess mental health well-being at the workplace. The utility of these instruments lies in their ability to detect those at risk of mental health issues so that they can be identified and helped reasonably. Other instruments aim to assess the positive aspects of work and functioning, to enhance the work-related factors that promote subjective well-being. Nebbs et al.[28] have reviewed 109 English-language instruments that could be potentially used to assess workplace mental health, and the reader is referred to this article for a comprehensive update. Some of the instruments and their characteristics are presented in Table 2.Table 2: Instruments with potential utility for workplace mental healthWhen and how to assess? The application of assessment and instruments would depend on their perceived utility. The screening instruments for the workplace environment can guide whether the workplace is attuned to the needs of the employees. It can also be used to track employee well-being over time and find out the responses to specific interventions. So, there may be two options for assessment: (1) on a regular basis to assess the well-being in the environment and (2) in situations where one or many employees experience significant distress that results in disruption at work. Considerations need to be given about when to apply such scales and instruments (routine periodic assessments or triggered by certain events or interventions), who should be the employees targeted for these (all employees or selected ones), who should have access to the data from the assessment (the management or any external agency—people are less likely to give the exact picture if they are under the coercion of the employer), and what is done with the data from the evaluation (are the data consigned to archives or some actions are taken based on the findings). Flowchart 2 presents a suggested assessment scheme for different sectors.Flowchart 2: Assessment according to different sectorsIssues of confidentiality and privacy If well-being assessment is being conducted at the behest of employers, then there remains a concern about dual agency on the part of the mental health professional. This means that the mental health professional is answerable to the individual employee and the employer. Anything spoken in confidence to the mental health professional can be used by the employer to cut employee privileges or even terminate him or her. Hence, the purpose of the assessment should be explicitly stated (preferably in a written record) besides clarity on who would have access to the assessments and how the results would be used. Preferably, assessments should be conducted by third parties who are not employed directly by the institution where the employees work. Furthermore, during assessments, mental health professionals should make it clear to the employees what information they must convey to the employers and which information should not be shared. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERVENTIONS Many reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have focused on the various aspects of workplace interventions. Most of the studies have used multimodal interventions; hence, it is difficult to tease out the most effective component among them. A review of 14 systematic reviews that focused on mental health interventions in the workplace on work outcomes found that the workplace interventions had components to improve both mental and physical health and multicomponent mental health interventions had the greatest impact. Moreover, interventions that contained in vivo exposure approaches were particularly effective for anxiety disorders.[37] A review of 55 studies that focused on organizational interventions promoting mental health and happiness among healthcare workers found that most studies have come from high-income countries and targeted nurses. The review also found that the most common construct assessed was burnout, stress, and work satisfaction. The interventions most commonly used were developing skills and knowledge, communication and team building, managing workload and time, stress management, and leadership development.[38] A review of 80 reviews that focused on mental well-being interventions found the highest quality evidence for mindfulness-based therapies, education and information provision, and individual psychological therapies, with the most common positive effect reported for burnout or stress reduction and mental well-being.[2] A rapid systematic scoping review of 30 articles that focused on mental health interventions at the workplace in India found that there were four types of mental health interventions in India: Corporate Wellness Program (which focuses on work–life balance strategies and wellness sessions, such as yoga and meditation) Employee Assistance Program (mainly focuses on providing counseling services) Employee Well-Being Program (provides health services—both physical and mental health) Peer Support Program (providing peer support). The review found that the majority of the available studies belonged to the first two categories. Many studies have explored preventive and promotive physical and mental health services. Some studies trained their employees on psychological first aid and established peer-support networks. Some studies focused on digital interventions provided by companies for their employee's mental health, including artificial intelligence-based ChatBot. However, the impact of these interventions and whether these interventions are effective have not been explored in this article.[39] A review of 66 meta-analyses that focused on universal, selective, and indicated interventions for supporting mental health at the workplace found that most meta-analyses on workplace interventions have either focused on a specific population, specific intervention, specific delivery format, or specific outcome. The review found that psychosocial interventions were the most common in all three intervention groups. Physical activity or lifestyle interventions were included in the programs that targeted either all general workers or healthcare workers, but not workers with mental illness symptoms.[40] The review found the following with respect to universal interventions: Psychosocial interventions, physical activity, and lifestyle interventions together were associated with a moderate effect on positive mental well-being (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.71) and a large effect on quality of life (SMD = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.28, 1.26). A meta-analysis that focused only on physical activity and lifestyle programs showed a small effect of the interventions on work ability (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.22). Psychosocial interventions alone had small effects on burnout (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.32) and insomnia (SMD = -2.21, 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.36). Mindfulness and contemplative interventions had a moderate effect on general distress (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.66) and a large effect on subjective well-being (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.53). Cognitive behavior treatment (CBT)-based interventions had a smaller effect on subjective well-being (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.40). Psychosocial interventions delivered through e-health formats showed a small effect on symptoms of common mental disorders (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.40), depression (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.35), burnout (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.5), stress (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.39), and work effectiveness (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.06 to 0.3) and a small-to-medium effect on well-being (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.46). All the included studies that focused on selective interventions were on healthcare workers. When psychosocial, physical, and lifestyle interventions were pooled together, there were a small effect on anxiety symptoms (SMD: 0.20p = 0.03), a moderate effect on stress (SMD = 0.060, P < 0.001), a moderate effect on resilience (SMD = 0.58, P = 0.001), and a large effect on mindfulness (SMD = 0.85, P < 0.001). Psychosocial interventions alone showed a small effect on depression symptoms (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.50) and a moderate effect on stress (SMD = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.15 to 1.07). These interventions also led to an absolute reduction of 2.06% in burnout symptoms. Psychosocial interventions led to a small-to-moderate effect on optimism (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.72), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.62), and resilience (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.65) and large effect on positive emotions (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.17, 1.53). Mindfulness-based interventions were found to have a small effect on general distress (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.38) and burnout (SMD: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.50), a moderate effect on depression (SMD: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.78) and stress (SMD: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.95), a large effect on anxiety (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.39), and a moderate effect on self-compassion (SMD: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.97). A Web-based CBT intervention targeting suicide-related outcomes among physicians was found to be effective, with 60% of those who followed the program being less likely to report suicidal ideation than a control group. The review found the following with respect to the indicated interventions. Psychosocial interventions showed small-to-moderate effects on depressive symptoms in patients with elevated depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.54). CBT-based interventions were found to have small-to-moderate effects on depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.61). No psychosocial intervention was found to be effective for burnout symptoms. E-health interventions were found to have a small-to-moderate effect on depression (SMD: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.53), anxiety (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.61), and overall symptoms of common mental disorders (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.75), a moderate effect on burnout (SMD = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.30, 0.88), large effects on stress (SMD: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.55,1.3) and insomnia (SMD: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.22, 1.39), and a small effect on improving work effectiveness (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.61). Stress management programs showed a moderate effect on symptoms of common mental disorders (SMD = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.85)[39] A systematic meta-review of 20 reviews, including 481 studies, divided the interventions into primary, secondary, and tertiary[41] [Table 3]. Table 3: Interventions pertaining to workplace[ 41 ] A systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tried to assess the effectiveness of occupational digital mental health interventions found that these interventions had a significant effect on psychological well-being (g = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.50) and work effectiveness (g = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.41). No specific psychological intervention was found to be superior to others. There was no significant difference between self-guidance and offering guidance and between universal intervention vs targeted intervention. Intervention characteristics that can increase engagement include offering guidance over a shorter time frame of 6 to 7 weeks, using secondary modalities for delivering interventions and engaging users (e.g., emails and text messages), and using self-monitoring and tailoring.[42] A systematic review of studies that focused on the effect of yoga at the workplace on health outcomes found that the overall effect of yoga on mental health was beneficial, especially on stress.[43] Thus, substantial literature has accrued on interventions to promote well-being in the workplace. However, much of the literature has come from the west. There is evidence from India as well.[38] GUIDANCE FOR MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS A review of 20 International Guidelines on Workplace mental health reported that the Canadian Standard had scored highest for both the quality and comprehensiveness of the content, followed by Australian Heads-Up Material, the British Health and Safety Management Standard, and the European Union Psychosocial Risk Management Excellence Framework (EU-PRIMA-EF) guidelines.[44] Based on these, the following are the steps of workplace-based interventions. Community Participation: Studies have found that stakeholders' participation in the intervention's development and implementation is necessary for the intervention's successful implementation.[45,46] Furthermore, this participation itself can lead to a positive effect on the employees' mental health and work.[47] Intervention Based on Needs: Interventions that are based on the actual needs at the workplace have been found to have a positive impact. This includes identifying the workplace factors that need to be targeted in the interventions, doing a pilot study, or using theoretical constructs to develop interventions focusing on the local needs and improving and expanding the interventions based on the pilot study.[45] Interventions could include universal, selective, indicated interventions, crisis interventions, medical leave, and allowing to rejoin work and rehabilitation. Advocating for Realistic Expectations: Interventions that create high expectations among workers can lead to negative or short-term positive effects, as there will be a mismatch between the high expectations of the participants and what the intervention can deliver. Hence, there is a need to define what can be expected and what not to make the expectations realistic for the workers.[47] Multicomponent interventions: Interventions that focus on both physical and mental health or have multicomponent mental health interventions have been found to have a greater effect on workplace outcomes.[37] Interventions should include psychosocial interventions, physical health, and lifestyle interventions. Inclusive Interventions: Interventions should be as inclusive as possible, with no stigma or discrimination related to gender or minority status. Interventions at Multiple Levels: Interventions are required at policy, organizational, employer, and employee levels. These are discussed further as follows. Employee-level interventions—These aim to build resilience, augment stress management skills, mitigate emotional distress, promote positive mental health among workers, and improve their work efficiency. Employees may be offered access to interventions based on mindfulness, cognitive behavior approaches, yoga, and resistance training. Box 1 provides employee-level suggestions to improve workplace mental health.Box 1: Suggestions for employee-level interventions to improve workplace mental healthManager-level interventions These interventions aim to empower training managers to identify and respond to mental health issues among team members, to provide them the necessary support, and modify relevant stressors in the working environment to preempt mental health issues among workers. These interventions do not aim to empower managers to diagnose and treat team members with mental health issues. In this context, managers refer to those in a direct supervisory capacity, or involved in supervising or managing team members or holding key administrative positions where they exert managerial control over workers. Box 2 provides manager-level suggestions to improve workplace mental health.Box 2: Suggestions for manager-level interventions to improve workplace mental healthOrganization-level interventions These interventions aim at resolving psychosocial risk factors and designing interventions that are participatory in nature for optimal uptake and impact in terms of mental health outcomes and work productivity. In doing so, as part of planning for organizational interventions, there must be a r","['mental', 'health', 'well-being', 'workplace']"
Leveraging AI for Public Health Communication: Opportunities and Risks,2024,"Even if public health leaders are more concerned than excited about artificial intelligence (AI), the genie is out of the bottle. In the area of health communication, AI has the potential to transform public education by enabling personalized messages tailored for diverse audiences, which may improve engagement and health outcomes. At the same time, AI poses real challenges and potential risks for public health departments. Just as the Internet, email, and social media have transformed the way we work and live over the past 30 years, easily accessible AI tools are rapidly changing our professional and personal lives. Just as with social media and the Internet generally, the specific impacts will be shaped by the choices we make and our ability to leverage new technologies to maximize benefits and reduce risks. Consider some of the opportunities and risks we're seeing now: Opportunities for AI in Health Communication Targeted messaging: Through sophisticated algorithms, AI can analyze vast amounts of data that can help communicators tailor and personalize communications. To measure the effectiveness of outreach campaigns, AI-driven analytics may provide insights into audience preferences, engagement metrics, and communication effectiveness, enabling communicators to make informed decisions about messaging strategies. Real-time monitoring: AI-powered surveillance systems can enable real-time monitoring of public health indicators, such as disease prevalence, vaccination rates, and health care utilization. They can even use predictive analytics to anticipate public health needs. The ability to analyze data from a vast number of sources can help public health communicators proactively develop strategies to address emerging health concerns and allocate resources effectively. Automation of routine tasks: As in other professional fields, AI technologies can automate repetitive tasks such as data analysis, content creation, and dissemination. This automation can free up valuable time for public health professionals to focus on strategic initiatives, policy development, and community outreach efforts. Improved accessibility: AI-powered language translation tools can facilitate multilingual communication, making health information accessible for diverse populations. Additionally, voice-based AI assistants can improve access to vital health resources and services for individuals with disabilities or limited literacy skills. Enhanced engagement: Interactive chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI offer opportunities for real-time engagement with the public. An example is Emma, a chatbot the U.S. Department of Homeland Security created to answer questions about immigration and citizenship. These platforms can provide instant responses to basic inquiries and disseminate timely information, which can improve engagement between organizations and the people they serve. Risks of Using AI for Health Communication Privacy concerns: The collection and analysis of personal health data by AI systems – protected health information as well as unprotected data from mobile health trackers, Internet searches, social media activity, and shopping history – raise significant privacy concerns. Public health executives must ensure compliance with regulations to protect data and implement robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse. Bias: AI algorithms may perpetuate bias and discrimination when they are based upon data from sources or systematic approaches that are inherently biased. Flawed and incomplete datasets or algorithms could create or exacerbate disparities in health communication and inequities in access to care. Because most resources have been going toward English-language tools, translation may be flawed. Public health executives must prioritize equity and fairness when deploying AI solutions and regularly audit algorithms to mitigate bias. Questions about accuracy and authenticity: Overreliance on AI technologies may lead to inaccurate, unsourced, or outdated information and undermine human judgment and interpersonal communication skills. Public health professionals must strike a balance between leveraging AI tools and maintaining human oversight to ensure ethical decision-making and transparent engagement with the public. Misinformation and misinterpretation: AI-generated content and automated responses may inadvertently spread misinformation or be misinterpreted by audiences. For example, New York City's ""MyCity"" chatbot has been found to generate inaccurate legal advice in areas like housing policy, labor laws, and consumer rights. Public health executives must implement rigorous quality control measures and provide clear guidelines for AI usage to prevent the dissemination of inaccurate or misleading information. Technical challenges: Deploying and maintaining AI systems requires ongoing specialized expertise and resources. Public health agencies may encounter technical challenges such as data integration issues, system interoperability, and algorithmic complexity. Investing in staff training and collaborating with AI experts can help mitigate these challenges and maximize the effectiveness of AI-enabled communication strategies. Public health leaders can respond to these challenges and opportunities by exploring the potential impact of AI, preparing for potential risks, and finding ways that AI can improve their services and strengthen their communities. Numerous efforts are tracking and guiding the effective use of AI, including executive guidance for state government agencies, insights from communications leaders across industries, and exploration of the ethical use of AI in public relations. In health communication, much of the focus to date has been about AI in health care, but this year the Analysis and Response Toolkit for Trust (ARTT) project and the National Public Health Information Coalition (NPHIC) brought together a working group that is developing practical guidelines or best practices for the ethical use of AI in public health communication. As leaders continue to explore these evolving technologies, they can take several practical steps to prepare within their organizations. Practical Steps for Public Health Leaders Build awareness and expertise: Lead by demonstrating your commitment and enthusiasm about exploring AI's potential to improve your organization's operations and impact. Solicit input from your employees about ways AI can enhance their efficiency and effectiveness and set priorities for your initial steps. Also tap into the expertise and perspectives of external stakeholders and consider pursuing collaborations with technology companies, academic institutions, and community organizations. Establish governance policies: Bring together communications professionals, data specialists, community educators, IT professionals, and other relevant staff and partners to develop clear policies and procedures for data collection, storage, and usage to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and ethical standards. Include standards for when and how to disclose the use of AI. Address ethical concerns and prioritize equity and inclusion: Ethical considerations – including transparency, privacy, accountability, and respect for individual autonomy – should guide the development and deployment of AI technologies for health communication. Engage diverse stakeholders to ensure that AI-enabled communication initiatives uphold ethical principles and promote public trust. Think big, but start small: After identifying potential opportunities, encourage your staff to pilot a few applications that are low-cost and low-risk, and ensure that these trials follow the governance policies you've set. Implement monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess the impact of AI-driven communication efforts on public awareness, behavior change, health outcomes, or other measures. Invest in staff training: Provide training and professional development opportunities for communication staff and other employees to enhance their AI literacy and technical skills. Even if you decide to not use AI widely, staff should understand the basics of artificial intelligence and how it influences the information they and community members access and create. AI presents unprecedented opportunities for public health executives to enhance communication effectiveness, engage diverse audiences, and address complex health problems. By carefully considering the challenges of AI usage, identifying opportunities for improvement, and taking practical steps to leverage AI responsibly, public health agencies can maximize the potential of AI to advance health outcomes in their communities.","['leveraging', 'public', 'health', 'communication:', 'opportunities', 'risks']"
Letter from Greece,2021,"Two years after our previous communication with a Letter from Greece,1 the world is entirely different. A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the major respiratory condition discussed for over 1 year now, not only in respiratory fora, but also in all the news channels of the planet. Back in 2019, our country was struggling to exit 10-year-long financial crisis and now we are in the middle of the deepest healthcare crisis of our generation. How is Greece doing lately respiratory-wise and how do we see the upcoming future? Greece has done relatively well so far in the pandemic, despite long-standing deficiencies in the national healthcare system. On 5 March 2021, Greece, with an estimated population of 10.7 million, has performed more than 5.5 million SARS-CoV-2 tests and we had 201,677 confirmed cases or 1.9% of the population (ranking 72nd worldwide, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:COVID-19_pandemic_data), while we experienced 6664 deaths (https://covid19.gov.gr/covid19-live-analytics/). In addition, 3.3% of the population have been fully vaccinated (ranking sixth in the European Union, https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/05/covid-19-vaccinations-in-europe-which-countries-are-leading-the-way). Gaps in health care are still evident in our country, both in terms of human resources and in facilities, and these cross-sectional numbers are of questionable importance in such an ongoing dynamic phenomenon, proven by the fact that we are currently facing a larger third wave of the pandemic. However, they are indicative of the massive effort undertaken by doctors and healthcare professionals in the first two waves. During the first wave of the pandemic, we entered a race for the multidisciplinary management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, in close collaboration with colleagues from internal medicine, infectious diseases and intensive care, and we developed dedicated COVID departments to provide the best possible care. At the same time, we observed a major reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory diseases compared to the previous years. In a retrospective observational study, we evaluated respiratory disease hospitalization rates across nine tertiary hospitals in Greece during March and April 2020 and compared those with the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019.2 We observed a reduction of over 45% in hospital admissions compared to the two previous years, the greatest being in sleep apnoea, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At the same time, a different group of authors observed a very low incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (two cases in 550 patients evaluated in referral centres).3 These observations may be a consequence both of the social distancing measures and the increased discipline of patients with chronic respiratory disorders. On the positive side, a significant parameter in the low rates of hospitalizations for respiratory disorders in Greece may have been the significant role of office-based respiratory physicians in the outpatient management of chronic respiratory patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of algorithms for the evaluation of severity and allocation to designated care may have further supported these outcomes.3 The Greek experience showed that collaboration between primary care and hospital care, in coordination by the authorities, resulted in the effective management during the first wave of the pandemic of COVID-19 in our country.3 In these tough times, Greece also contributed to the global effort for COVID-19 research with 683 publications, ranking 29th in 207 countries, based on data retrieved from Clarivate's Web of Science (https://www.ekt.gr/en/news/25308). In parallel, the quest for the development of new technologies and digital solutions is in the frontline of research, and one of the most highlighted areas of research is artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. In a systematic review of artificial intelligence techniques in asthma, our group was able to recognize that this is a rapidly developing field that, however, needs to be refined in the future to reach clinical applications.4 Telemedicine and techniques for remote monitoring and management of patients have been in the spotlight of interest and intense research during these times. We have all experienced missed appointments with patients with severe chronic respiratory disease and some of our patients may have missed important treatments, especially in the early days of the pandemic. To support these unmet needs, we tried to use novel technologies for remote monitoring and management. For example, a significant aid in the management of patients with severe asthma in our department has been the implementation of portable spirometry (Air Next Spirometer; NuvoAir, Sweden) and the use of multiple electronic channels to contact our patients. Our learnings are likely to reform the follow-up and management of patients with chronic respiratory conditions in the future. Medical education has been a major challenge during the pandemic and, as in all areas of education, we have incorporated digital technologies for the teaching of medical students. Nevertheless, a significant part of face-to-face training has not taken place during the pandemic. Novel technologies, including online simulation platforms and the use of holograms, have been used to improve educational experience. In a vivid example from the recent congress of the European Respiratory Society, our holograms participated in a live event with colleagues from Australia and Germany (Figure 1, Video S1 in the Supporting Information). A positive outcome of the pandemic is that the use of such technologies is here to stay, minimizing the need for travel and providing quality education to broader audiences. Nevertheless, medicine is overall a hands-on art, and we need to find ways to ensure that face-to-face training will also continue smoothly in the near future. But medicine is not our entire life, and during the pandemic we had to embrace innovation on different levels to stay in good mood and maintain our courage. In such an effort, with a small group of respiratory physician friends, we developed 'Music Will Save the World' (also in the COVID-19 era), a Facebook group where we are sharing music during the social distancing times (https://www.facebook.com/groups/musicwillsavetheworldcovid19). The group grew up fast last April and has now more than 13,000 members, many of whom are healthcare professionals related to respiratory medicine. With positive spirit we move forward and, sharing with you our warmest wishes from Greece to stay healthy, we hope that in the next Letter from Greece in a couple of years, the pandemic will be a distant memory.

Advancing American Kidney Health,2019,"Introduction Advancing American Kidney Health (AAKH) (1) has the potential to transform kidney care in America and outlines what the kidney care community has been striving to achieve for decades, as described in the recently released Kidney Care Partners Kidney Care First initiative (2). This includes prevention and appropriate management of CKD to slow progression, providing education to optimize patient engagement in care and choice of treatment modality, and keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital and ready to receive a transplant, when available. At DaVita, a leading global provider of kidney care services, we pioneered the patient-centered quality pyramid (3), where patient quality of life is the ultimate goal of care. We have been working to transform kidney care for patients with our CKD education program (Kidney Smart), and our industry-leading record for home therapy and supporting patients in their pursuit of kidney transplantation. This paper represents a clinical perspective on the AAKH initiatives to improve patient outcomes and the potential challenges in doing so. We and others in the kidney care community are urging the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to delay implementation of the AAKH mandatory model so that we may all work together to improve it, including waivers that would facilitate coordination between nephrologists, patients, and dialysis providers among patients with later-stage CKD. These policy concerns, although important, are beyond the scope of this paper. CKD: Detecting CKD, Slowing Progression, and Managing Transitions New tools and workflow transformation will be needed to better address CKD. This will require moving to team-based models that include the patient (4), clinical optimization, care coordination, and self-care, all steps DaVita is supporting in helping clinicians improve precision and effectiveness of CKD care. Clinical optimization requires population health and decision support tools embedded in the electronic health record to inform patient risk stratification and population trends. Such data, when used by physician-led, multidisciplinary teams, enhances team and patient communication and shared decision-making (5). Ideally, such tools also support care pathways and practice resource allocation. The most challenging part of transformation may be changes in workflow, i.e., how nephrologists deliver care. This will require potentially new team members, additional infrastructure, and more efficient use of technology. The payment models in the AAKH initiative though an impetus for practice transformation do not overtly support it. The Current Procedural Terminology codes for chronic care management (99487, 99489, and 99490), transitional care management (99495 and 99496), dietary counseling (97802–97804), and the proposed principal care management services (GPPP1 and GPPP2) cover many of the multidisciplinary services necessary for success in the proposed models but are transactional for direct services. Practices will still need to consider additional investment to support clinical optimization and care coordination. New tools for CKD management and patient engagement are not easily implemented by small or medium-sized practices, although partnerships with health systems or kidney care providers could make this easier. DaVita has deployed patient-centered education through Kidney Smart and Start Smart programs and, in collaboration with nephrology practices, CKD practice support tools. Patients educated through Kidney Smart are six times more likely to start on a home modality and patients in our CKD program were significantly more likely to have a nephrologist at transition to ESKD, with 72% of ESKD transitions being outpatient. These could be cornerstones of CKD care if and when waivers are introduced to enable us to extend them to nephrologists. Home: Novel Ways to Expand Care Delivery to Patients on Home Dialysis United States patients appear to lack access to home dialysis, even though patients with ESKD on home dialysis have the potential to experience a higher quality of life, better preservation of residual kidney function on peritoneal dialysis, less risk for cardiac stunning, and a slower rate of cognitive decline (6). Home hemodialysis offers patients better solute and volume control, better BP control, fewer episodes of hypotension, and stabilization of cardiac structure. Home hemodialysis allows physicians to individualize the dialysis prescription to meet the patient’s clinical needs and control risk factors. A recent home dialysis conference sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative examined barriers to home dialysis (7). Conference participants supported a systematic change in CKD education, a shift in the approach to initiating dialysis, additional incentives for home dialysis, and breakthroughs to simplify home dialysis modality performance. The AAKH initiative advances those conclusions by advocating for a significant increase in home dialysis for patients with ESKD. Average United States home dialysis penetration ranges between 10% and 12% because of various factors, including program size; clinical competence of the medical director, nephrologists, and nurses; patient loss rates; and lack of predialysis education. The last is exceedingly important given the benefits of educating patients with CKD about home dialysis and the positive perception of home dialysis by many patients. To reach the objectives of the AAKH initiative, it will require adopting a “home first” culture, multitouch patient education, physician competency in home dialysis modalities, increased conversions to home dialysis modalities, a reduction in patient losses from home modalities, consistent patient-centered training, and root-cause analyses of hospitalizations and complications. DaVita has been a leader in home dialysis, with >25,000 United States patients on home dialysis modalities. DaVita has invested significantly in a technology platform to transform the experience for patients on home dialysis with Home Dialysis Connect, a technology suite designed to improve patient experience and outcomes. Home Dialysis Connect includes DaVita Care connect (a patient-centered mobile application supporting multiway video visits, customized education, scheduling, reminders, secure texting, and image sharing), home remote monitoring (Bluetooth-enabled devices to transmit patient biometrics, health status via tablet-based questions, and device treatment data), telehealth (virtual visits with the patient, physician, and health care team [nurse, social worker, dietician, and care manager]), and artificial intelligence predictive analytics. Virtual monitoring of care enhances patient experience and proactively allows the care team to address problems that may occur outside of the traditional monthly visit cadence. Finally, newer approaches to education whether training patients, increasing nursing skills, or educating physicians will ensure program capabilities regardless of size. Transplant: Working Upstream of the Transplant Center As a kidney care provider, it is always our objective to have each patient reach the quality of life that they desire. We believe that kidney transplantation is the best modality for patients with ESKD. The AAKH initiative outlined steps to increase kidney transplantation, focusing on the supply side of the transplant equation, transplant rate, and post-transplant outcomes. Features in the concurrently announced payment models also supported kidney transplantation. The Kidney Care First and Comprehensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) models included payments for patients transplanted who have a kidney transplant maintained 3 years. Finally, in the CKCC models, transplant providers are required participants in addition to nephrologists. DaVita can educate and care for patients with ESKD with their nephrologists to prepare patients for transplantation with novel educational programs to explain the transplant process (Transplant Smart). We hope to be able to extend this information to patients with CKD in settings where they can interact with their physician and outline a personalized plan for transplantation if and when they approach ESKD. We also have piloted waitlist management support programs with transplant centers to facilitate communication between patients, providers, nephrologists, and transplant centers for critical patient information. A feature of this program has been to provide patients with the same data that the transplant center receives. In that way, all stakeholders can review the same information related to the patient’s status. Finally, providers can be an essential partner working with the nephrologist and the transplant center to help evaluate, monitor, and treat comorbid conditions for patients awaiting transplantation. This is an area in which DaVita has demonstrated expertise with its involvement and contributions to the success of the Comprehensive ESKD Care model (8). These efforts emphasize where providers working with nephrologists can encourage patients to explore transplantation, consider living donor transplantation, and support patients in remaining healthy while they are on the waitlist. This should positively affect the demand side of the transplant equation and allow organ procurement organizations and transplant centers to enact their changes to positively affect the supply side. Summary Although aspects of the AAKH initiative are subject to debate, the initiative is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to positively address the kidney care continuum from CKD to dialysis and transplantation. As a kidney care provider, we see DaVita’s emphasis on innovation combined with its unremitting focus on quality of care expanding beyond dialysis and supporting the continuum of care for patients with kidney disease in partnership with nephrologists. We believe this is very much aligned with the administration’s effort to change the outcomes of patients with kidney disease. A modest delay in implementation to create consensus-driven changes in the mandatory model may help it achieve many of its stated goals. Moreover, the Kidney Care First and CKCC models can benefit from the lessons learned from the Comprehensive ESKD Care model by providing certainty of performance targets/measurements and flexibility in participation options for the structure of new models. Disclosures Dr. Becker and Dr. Nissenson are employees of and own stock in DaVita.","['advancing', 'american', 'kidney', 'health']"
"Global sourcing and development: New drivers, models, and impacts",2018,"This special section on Global Sourcing and Development: New Drivers, Models and Impacts brings together 3 related discourses. The first discourse of global sourcing has a rich body of literature in information systems and is defined as the process and organisation through which work is contracted or delegated to an external or internal entity that could be physically located anywhere—typically in low-cost countries. It encompasses various outsourcing arrangements such as offshore outsourcing, captive offshoring, nearshoring, and onshoring (Oshri, Kotlarsky, & Willcocks, 2015). The second discourse is a relatively smaller body of literature located mainly in the Information Communication Technology for Development literature that analyses the contribution of global sourcing to development (eg, Heeks, 1996 1996). Sein and Harindranath (2004) classify the 3 main perspectives on development as modernisation, dependency and human development. Building on these perspectives on development brings us to the third discourse—new drivers, models, and impacts introduced by this special issue. Put briefly, the initial phase of global sourcing in the 1980s and 90s was focussed on establishing the technical and financial feasibility of the global sourcing model of work. For companies in the West, a primary driver was cost reduction to achieve competitive advantage. For the provider firms such as in India, the motivation focussed on rapid growth, furthering employment and gaining more visibility on the global sourcing stage. Once the feasibility of such work was established, from the 1990s onwards, many countries followed India and Israel, such as Costa Rica and Iran. Different sourcing models emerged such as nearshoring and insourcing. As these models of work matured, some reverse innovations became visible, with large sourcing firms in India even buying out technology developers in the United States and Europe. Various forms of backlash to this spread of outsourcing also emerged, as evidenced recently by President Trump's political agenda of ""Make America Great Again"". Currently, a new trend in global sourcing is development, which is manifested as ""impact sourcing"", the focus of this issue. The first example of global sourcing involved software contracts outsourced to India in the late 1970s. In those early days, the trade was comprised of the physical transfer of coding specifications to ""software factories"" mainly in India and the return of code delivered on physical media (such as tapes and discs) sent via courier. An example of such a firm is India's Infosys and Narayana Murthy then CEO of a startup who was interviewed in the 1980s by one of the editors of this issue (Richard Heeks). This early stage in the development of global sourcing also involved the physical movement of engineers, again mainly from India, to client sites in the United States and Western Europe, the practice of which became known as ""bodyshopping"". Since then we have observed a year-on-year realisation of Moore's Law in the form of a spectacular increase in capacity of computing, a dramatic reduction in cost and the convergence of computing with telecommunications, all of which are familiar to readers of this journal. These technological advances have been concomitant with advances in software development management including structured methods and standards such as ISO9000 and the stages of the Capability Maturity Model. All these factors taken together catapulted the practice of global sourcing and its expansion across 3 dimensions: scale, geographical spread, and range of service offerings. Dealing first with scale, during the editors' respective careers researching the global sourcing phenomenon, we have witnessed spectacular year on year growth to a global market size in 2014 of US$104.6 billion (2014). * Meeting the demand are the global sourcing providers, geographically spread in clusters around the world. Since 2004, the management consulting firm A.T. Kearney has published the Global Services Location Index that ranks the top 50 countries that provide global sourcing. The ranking shows that India remains as the ""undisputed champion"" but the global scenario has evolved into a network of providers located in ""new entrant"" countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America/Caribbean. There is clear evidence of economic development as a result of this. In 2015, India's global sourcing sector contributed 9.5% to gross domestic product (GDP) and used 3.5 million people (Nasscom 2015) up from 0.005% of GDP and 500 people in 1980 (Heeks, 1996 1996). India's spectacular growth in global sourcing convinced many including the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank that the development of an outsourcing industry offered a route for other countries to economic development. During the early 2000s, the editors were involved in projects aimed at sectoral growth in global sourcing. A starting point was the development of the Software Export Success Model (Heeks & Nicholson, 2004) derived from an explication of the lessons from the leading software export nations into a pragmatic framework for policymakers to design for sector development. This framework became influential and to our knowledge was used in policymaking processes in Egypt and Argentina. The model was applied in our own action research in Iran (Nicholson & Sahay, 2003) and Costa Rica (Nicholson & Sahay, 2009). Moving to the expansion in the range of services, it is instructive to continue the story of Infosys, which today is a multinational and one of the largest information technology service providers in the world with annual revenues in excess of US$10bn. Infosys' service offerings have expanded from software development to encompass multiple digitally enabled services including call centres, accounting, and legal process outsourcing. Services over time have moved to new and more sophisticated higher value activities. The buzzword of the 2000s was 'Knowledge Process Outsourcing' that extended the range of employment possibilities in India from transcription and data input to very highly qualified staff being used at Masters and PhD level. Thus, there is evidence that global sourcing has provided modernisation and human development in GDP, jobs in developing countries, and the improvement in capability associated with skills. More recently some of these large firms such as Infosys have engaged with development agendas framed as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and incorporated into the work of their charitable foundations. This has emerged alongside an impetus from the Rockefeller foundation for impact sourcing. These expansions of scale, geography, and range of services have been enabled in India and other leading global clusters by supportive government incentives, investments in education and skills training, improved legal institutions, English language, and rapid expansions in the capacity and lowering in cost of the computing and telecommunication infrastructure. However, warnings of negative impacts also emerged during this period challenging the development potential of global sourcing. The examination by Nicholson and Sahay (2001) and Ravishankar, Pan, and Myers (2013) of the dynamics of power and control relate to the dependency perspective on development exposing enduring 2postcolonial influences and instrumental use of global sourcing to undermine a UK-based workforce. Others such as Payaril (2005) argued that global sourcing causes job loss and enables an exploitative relationship enabling the rich to get richer, he posits ""deepening income inequalities in the developing world and deepening income inequalities in the developed world after the onset of the so-called information economy"". Madon and Sahay's (2002) examination of the slums of India's global sourcing hotspot of Bangalore provided evidence that the economic development benefits of global sourcing were not ""trickling down"" to the poorest members of society. Contemporary debates (for a detailed review see Nicholson, Babin, & Lacity, 2017) can be divided into 3 main themes: firstly, the link between development and global sourcing has continued to be an important in policymaking. For instance, Graham and Mann (2013) describe Kenya's ambition to be a global sourcing sector facilitated by new fibre optic broadband linkages with the vision of providing employment to marginalised people thus lifting them out of poverty. Secondly, from the late 2000s onwards, corporate social responsibility issues became prominent in global sourcing. Babin and Nicholson (2012) chart the inclusion of standards into supply chains and global sourcing industry associations such as International Association of Outsourcing Professionals embracing corporate social responsibility into their annual sourcing industry awards. Thirdly is the notion of ""impact sourcing"" referring to the ability for computing and telecommunications to enable digitised work to be undertaken almost anywhere with sufficient computing, bandwidth, and skills, thus offering employment to marginalised people. The 2 papers in this special section are focussed on the impact sourcing theme, and thus, we focus on the issue. Firstly, a short definition from the Global Impact Sourcing Coalition † (GISC): ""Impact Sourcing is an inclusive employment practice through which companies in global supply chains intentionally hire and provide career development opportunities to people who otherwise have limited prospects for formal education, to deliver business outcomes. Impact sourcing has been shown to provide many business benefits, including access to new sources of talent, higher levels of employee engagement, and lower attrition rates, while offering employees their first step into a career ladder that leads to economic self-sufficiency through income growth, skills development and professional advancement."" The Rockefeller Foundation has been instrumental in promoting impact sourcing through its Digital Jobs Africa Initiative and has funded reports by consulting firms such as Monitor Group, Avasant, Accenture, and Everest Group. In addition to the Rockefeller Foundation, a number of organisations such as the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals and National Association of Software and Services Companies Foundation have promoted the practice. A significant discourse has emerged in the academic literature that specifically examines impact sourcing summarised in Table 1. A report by the Everest Group in 2014 claimed that impact sourcing is growing faster than the overall global sourcing market and used around 240 000 people globally with India, the Philippines, and South Africa contributing close to 90% of this workforce. These impact sourcing relationships reflect an increasing scope for both clients and workers: clients used to be mainly large Western firms but impact sourcing has spread to small enterprises and microenterprises, and the scope of workers has spread to include a broader spectrum of the less-wealthy marginalised groups. This may include prisoners, military veterans, groups marginalised by ethnicity, gender, remoteness of locations, or natural disasters. Impact sourcing organisations themselves tend to be smaller scale in contrast to the vast back office processing ""factories"" of TCS, Infosys, and the other giants located in Bangalore and other hotspots in India, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The early literature is optimistic; for instance, Heeks and Arun's (2010) case of Kumdunbashree in Kerala tells the story of human development of mainly female workers and how their livelihoods have been improved. Madon and Sharanappa (2013) are also optimistic on the improvement to worker capabilities. Subsequent literature has analysed the long-term sustainability of impact sourcing and how tensions related to problematic relationships with local communities may need to be managed to achieve economic and human development (Sandeep & Ravishankar, 2016). The themes of this academic research have progressed from making sense of impact to the recipients of impact sourcing with a development lens in mind, to the relevance and alignment with communities in ""framing"" impact sourcing. To date, the cases are small scale and many involve social enterprise-type business models. In 2017, Business for Social Responsibility with sponsorship from the Rockefeller Foundation created the GISC, which is a collaborative initiative of mainly vendors of business services who are committed to impact sourcing. The initial focus of GISC is to create an impact sourcing standard. We perceive other topics of future research focus in impact sourcing's health and safety implications related to content moderation and removal of offensive material (porn, beheadings, etc.) from digital platforms. Secondly, impact sourcing has shifted to a concern with ""gig economy"" platforms such as Upwork and the possibilities for employment as freelancers. The provincial governments of Pakistan have introduced schemes for training many thousands to offer themselves as Upwork freelancers. This is in tension with precarious employment, and lack of holiday, sickness, or pension provision that critics have identified (Heeks, 2017). Other topics of future interest include the potential of impact sourcing to help refugees (eg, http://techfugees.com) using smart phones. The threats to impact sourcing are also worth mentioning including the impact of artificial intelligence and robotic process automation and the threat to automate the category of work that impact sourcing firms and some workers rely on. This brings us to the contribution of the papers in this special section that identify new drivers, models, and impacts. The article by Khan, Lacity, and Carmel (2018) titled Entrepreneurial Impact Sourcing: A Conceptual Framework of Social and Commercial Institutional Logics answers calls to conceptualise emerging global sourcing models that have direct social and development implications. Specifically, they focus on innovative and entrepreneurial impact sourcing service provider firms. They highlight that such impact sourcing service providers not only espouse the economic imperatives of global sourcing clients (ie, create commercial/business value) but also endeavour to bring about positive social change and development (ie, create social value). They develop the idea that impact sourcing firms can be viewed as entrepreneurial social enterprises, and thus, it is important to view these firms in a framework that uses key characteristics of such firms. Khan et al. introduce a new conceptual framework, consisting of 4 dimensions: primary mission, success criteria, resource mobilisation, and innovation approach. These 4 dimensions are anchored across ideal types of social and commercial institutional logics. With that framework, they then examine at a US-based business process outsourcing social enterprise that focuses on the underserved workforce of military veterans and spouses of military personnel. Khan et al. validate the framework and find that this firm used social logic for both the firm's primary mission and the firm's resource mobilisation, used commercial logic for its success criteria, and used both logics for its innovation. The paper by Sandeep and Ravishankar (2018) titled Sociocultural Transitions and Developmental Impacts in the Digital Economy of Impact Sourcing reveals the lived experience of situated impact sourcing employees who face the daunting task of transitioning from their traditional communities to the relatively modern workplaces in impact sourcing companies. These transition experiences expose them to a variety of work-life challenges and, at the same time, serve as occasions for individual and collective development. Drawing on an inductive qualitative study of an up-and-coming Indian impact sourcing company, the paper explores how impact sourcing employees experience sociocultural transitions and realise developmental impacts. The findings suggest that compartmentalisation and integration strategies help impact sourcing employees manage boundaries arising from the contrasting cultural expectations of the community and the workplace. The paper also finds that impact sourcing employees respond to sociocultural transition challenges in the workplace through a series of cognitive adjustments, which involve (a) the creation of social safety nets via the development of fictive kinships, (b) the reconfiguration of the meaning of work via job crafting, and (c) experimentation with provisional selves. Furthermore, the analysis shows how intense engagement with sociocultural transitions can lead to the development of crucial individual and collective capabilities. In closing, a model of capability development of impact sourcing employees is outlined, and the implications for impact sourcing companies are discussed. In summary, we can perceive changes in the scope and scale of the global sourcing industry over time from an industry centred mainly in India to a globalised network of relationships. Myriad tensions exist around the development potential of global sourcing, and recent developments around impact sourcing may offer some promise to enable marginalised groups to benefit from livelihoods associated with employment. However, realising these benefits is in tension with problems of scaling the associated ventures and the limits of the dominant social enterprise business model. In the spirit of Geoff Walsham's call for research aimed at making a better world with information and communication technologies, we hope that the papers in this issue will stimulate further interest and research into this important issue.","['global', 'sourcing', 'development:', 'drivers,', 'models,', 'impacts']"
Relationship between the concepts of “Digital transformation” and “Industry 5.0”: bibliometric analysis,2024,"At the current stage of transformational transformations, the problems of transformation of the national economy are extremely relevant. And these questions are especially relevant in the conditions of rapid development of the digital economy. According to estimates by Forbes experts, 67% of the leaders of companies from the Global 2000 list chose digital transformation as a priority goal of their corporate strategy in 2018. According to a study by analysts International Data Corporation, the total global spending on digital technologies will grow by 16.8% annually and amounted to 2.1 trillion dollars in 2019. Research by Huawei and Oxford Economics has shown that intelligent network interaction will trigger the growth of the digital economy, which will reach 23 trillion dollars by 2025. This increase will be 78.3% compared to 2017 (12.9 trillion dollars). By 2025, the share of the digital economy is planned to increase by 7.2 percentage points, or from 17.1 to 24.3% of global GDP. According to the calculations of The Boston Consulting Group experts, the volume of the digital economy by 2035 will amount to 16 trillion dollars USA. In view of this, the purpose of this study is to determine the trends and key directions of digital transformation research in the era of Industry 5.0 based on bibliometric analysis using the VOSviewer software. The article carries out a bibliometric analysis of the relationship between the terms “digital transformation”, “digitalization”,”Industry 4.0”, “Industry 5.0”. It has been established that currently the problems of the digital transformation of the economy in the context of the implementation of the digital strategy of the European Union are gaining special relevance. Digital transformation is a key component of the overall strategy to transform the global economy. Correctly selected digital technologies combined with employee competencies, processes and operations will allow companies to quickly adapt to crisis situations, use promising opportunities to modernize work processes, meet new and constantly changing customer needs, stimulate growth and implement innovative and management solutions. The concept of digital transformation of the national economy in the context of Industry 5.0 should involve the use of digital tools and platforms to transform traditional business processes, improve interaction with customers, introduce innovative technologies and form a digital ecosystem. The main components of the digital transformation of critical infrastructure include: digital technologies (cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT); organizational changes (restructuring of processes to increase their flexibility, introduction of new methodologies (DevOps, Agile), formation of a digital culture); customer orientation and integration of digital channels. For effective digital transformation of the economy on a practical level, it is advisable to pay attention to such main aspects as: having a clear vision and strategy that meets business goals; involving different groups of stakeholders and ensuring the interest of the entire organization; constant monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of digital transformation initiatives; an adaptive and iterative approach that allows you to navigate the changing digital landscape. It has been proven that the priority direction of research in the future should be the substantiation of the theoretical and methodological provisions of the formation of the digital ecosystem.","['relationship', 'between', 'concepts', '“digital', 'transformation”', '“industry', '5.0”:', 'bibliometric', 'analysis']"
The AI revolution in micro-credentialing: personalized learning paths,2024,"In the modern educational landscape, the pace of technological change has ushered in a transformation where artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into learning and development in nearly all areas. A lot of that transformation has been through the rise of micro-credentialing, whereby the need for flexible, skill-specific education becomes very close to the needs of the changing global workforce (Kiiskilä et al., 2022). Often referred to as mini-qualifications for demonstrating a certain level of competency in a certain area, micro-credentials are increasingly being recognized for the potential role they play in filling in the gaps left by the traditional configurations of education (Keoy et al., 2024). They provide a channel through which the learner is able to both obtain and demonstrate the skill in a way that is both effective and relevant to their career. McGreal and Olcott (2022) critically examine the role of micro-credentials in higher education, highlighting their potential as strategic tools for institutional adaptation while cautioning that they are not a universal solution to institutional challenges. They emphasize the importance of a strategic assessment by university leaders to determine whether microcredentials align with their institutional goals and resources, rather than automatically adopting them as a revenue-generating initiative (McGreal and Olcott, 2022).Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans. About micro-credentialing, AI covers most technologies ranging from machine learning to natural language processing and down to expert systems. Figure 1 visually summarizes the relationship between AI technologies-Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Expert Systems-and their specific applications in micro-credentialing. Recent advances in AI are largely driven by neural networks, particularly deep learning models. These networks, inspired by the brain's architecture, excel at pattern recognition and prediction from large datasets. In micro-credentialing, neural networks enhance personalized learning by analyzing extensive learner data, enabling more effective educational technologies. Machine learning algorithms use overflowing data sets to identify patterns in data and infer incomplete information about learners to propose a personalized learning pathway. NLP helps develop intelligent tutoring systems so the students themselves can turn in for the facility to obtain real-time feedback and facilitate interactive learning experiences. Expert systems, mimicking human expert decisions, help devise curricula and assessments and make them adaptive by a learner's needs. For example, IBM uses AI to develop tailored reskilling programs, and platforms like Coursera use AI to suggest courses to learners based on their learner profiles. Of course, all of these AI technologies will help enhance micro-credentialing by increasing the personalization, efficiency, and responsiveness of education to learners' and industry demands. Artificial Intelligence in micro-credentialing will prove to be a game-changer, adding a crucial aspect to any learning experience: personalization (McGreal, 2024). Artificial Intelligence technologies analyze extensive datasets of behavior, preferences, and performance of the learners to develop an educational trajectory that is not only in sync with the learning style of the individual but is also adaptive to the changing requirements of the industry (Blaj-Ward et al., 2023). Personalization like this, scaling learner engagement and success through AI, will make learning a dynamic and frictionless process that will be responsive to the demands of the learner and the larger economy (McGreal, 2024). In recent years, several studies have explored the transformative potential of AI in education, particularly in micro-credentialing. Pirkkalainen et al. describe the key features of higher education micro-credential platforms, pointing out ethical implications regarding data privacy and algorithmic bias. This points to the fact that ethical concerns have to be dealt with carefully to ensure a responsible AI implementation within educational institutions (Pirkkalainen et al., 2023). Ahmat et al. review the challenges and opportunities for higher education to move towards micro-credential certification in a manner curator-oriented, focusing on how such innovations could resolve skill gaps and increase workforce readiness. Their work highlighted economic benefits and has the potential of microcredentials in providing better employability (Ahmat et al., 2021). Orman et al. intend to scrutinize the role of AI in democratizing education and mitigating the digital divide. It requires specific efforts to enhance infrastructure and literacy in the digital aspect of underserved communities. It highlights the possible contributions AI can make to bridge educational gaps (Orman et al., 2023). Tian et al. discuss the integration of AI into blockchain technology to increase credibility and enhance micro-credential security. Their study outlines how such integration in technology would lead to heightened security and trustworthiness of educational credentials (Tian et al., 2022). Brown et al. give an overview of the complete global landscape of micro-credentialing in their paper, reviewing how micro-credentials fit within the interrelationship of lifelong learning and employability. Their work presents an opportunity for micro-credentials to become a more established component of education in the 21st century (Brown et al., 2021). Zawacki-Richter et al. conducted a systematic review of AI applications in higher education settings that define the most relevant key areas: profiling, assessment, adaptive systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. The study underlines the challenges and opportunities that AI brings to educational contexts (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). Rajabalee proposes a systematic analysis of the literature about implementing micro-credentials within academic contexts and underlines their potential: namely, becoming recognized credits that would be transferable in formal higher education (Rajabalee, 2023).In light of the above, and although the application of AI in micro-credentialing seems promising, this raises some pertinent questions and issues, such as data privacy, access to equity, and long-run effects on employment. This paper interacts with the AI revolution in micro-credentialing to posit that, though not void of challenges, it is an imperative and, indeed, developmental phase education needs to go through and is likely to birth overwhelmingly positive benefits for learners worldwide if thoughtfully managed.to birth overwhelmingly positive benefits for learners worldwide if thoughtfully managed.This use of artificial intelligence in the integration of micro-credentialing systems heralds a new era of personalized education: a transformation in how we learn and how we are assessed in skills and knowledge. This will bring the strength of AI to be harnessed and tapped into personalized learning in response to individual learners' needs, optimizing their educational paths and probably accelerating their career advancement.The benefits of AI in micro-credentialing lie at the foundation. Primary among them is the fact that AI allows for dynamic learning environments that evolve in real time with a learner's progress, preferences, and performance. Such learning analytics will allow AI to understand how learners interact with material, tune task difficulty, or suggest more resources to better assist learners with the struggles they face. This kind of customization was never before possible within traditional educational settings, in which one-size-fits-all approaches too frequently predominate.Most importantly, AI will be used for the identification of the gaps in the skills pool and the trends in industry which are emerging, enabling the programs to be updated regularly and issue microcredentials that are most relevant to the market need today. This will keep learners competitive in the workforce and address skill shortages that have left industries in a tough spot, aligning education more with economic requirements. For example, job listings, industry releases, professional development trends, and the like can all go into an algorithm that would then present to or automatically enroll learners into micro-courses that enhance their employability. More generally, automation of the processes of assessment and feedback through AI will reduce the administrative overhead and will enable scalable solutions in credentialing. Automated grading systems and AI-enhanced evaluations will provide instantaneous, detailed feedback to learners-a capability missing from today's skillsbased educational tools, primarily due to the resource-intense nature of providing human-generated feedback on many assignments.However, AI in micro-credentialing is not without its challenges. It must address issues regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the digital divide if it is going to live up to its potential in this space. Nevertheless, with the benefits of increased access, more personalized learning, and closer alignment to labor market demand, AI-driven micro-credentialing is bound to be a transforming force in the education system-an improvement in the way qualifications are to be achieved and recognized in the digital age.Most of the criticism in this regard focuses on data privacy and the risk for increased digital divide in AI for education. The proponents of skepticism argue that AI and digital platforms might skew reliance toward the better-off in terms of the access of technology, leaving the low-income population behind. Moreover, because data collection is pervasive, huge privacy concerns are attached to AI applications. However, strong data protection regulations such as those contained in the EU GDPR, which offers solid privacy protections, might mitigate these concerns. Moreover, with enhanced efforts to expand digital infrastructure and literacy into low-income and rural areas, the disparities of AI-enhanced learning will be low, hence making the distribution of educational benefits more equal. On the one hand, the integration of AI into micro-credentialing has various advantages for education; on the other, it has created a whole set of concerns and opposition that has to be taken into account to make sure that the innovations go in the best interests of all the stakeholders. Chief among such concerns are problems related to data privacy, the digital divide, and potential biases in the AI algorithms.Data privacy seems to be one of the major concerns, as AI needs access to huge volumes of personal information to be able to tailor the learning experience effectively. As others argue, data collection and analysis might lead to possible privacy breaches in case it is not handled properly. The good thing is that this kind of situation necessitates the existence of good data protection measures. This would mean that there are strict policies in handling data and security protocols that ensure the information regarding the learners is protected. Further, clearly stating how the data would be used and getting consent from the users can help reduce issues of privacy and ensure trust in AI systems.Another critical issue is that AI-driven micro-credentialing will exclude some people who are maybe not in a position to fully exploit the programs on account of lack of access to the technological infrastructure for the same. People of low socioeconomic status or in remote locations may not have the technological infrastructure that would enable them to take full advantage of those programs. There is a need for targeted initiatives in this regard, as this will increase both digital literacy and access to technology. Partnerships among governments, educational institutions, and the private sector will ensure the deployment of affordable technology and internet access, thus guaranteeing that AI's benefits are more evenly distributed among the people.Algorithmic bias is one of the main issues that need to be addressed. AI is as neutral as the data it learns from; hence, bad data will generate bad decisions and therefore perpetuate discrimination. This serves to underscore the need to make investments in AI systems developed using diverse and inclusive data sets, and continuously monitor and adapt the systems to steer clear of practices considered unfair. Furthermore, the embedding of regulatory frameworks in the process-to be fair in its algorithms-can even be more protective against bias in ensuring that AI-driven micro-credentialing becomes an enabler for educational equity. All these issues, addressed proactively, will pave the way for the full realization of AI potential for micro-credentialing, enabling very personalized, efficient, and fair educational opportunities fit for the modern workforce.A wealth of literature and practical applications testify to the practical effect and potential of AI in micro-credentialing. For instance, according to one research by MIT scholars, AI-based individualized learning systems can reduce the time taken to achieve fluency in a subject by up to 50%. Table 1 shows a comparison of AI-driven micro-credentialing platforms, highlighting the AI technologies used, the level of personalization features, their relevance to industry needs, and the success rates achieved. AIdriven micro-credentialing programs are now being rolled out across corporations like IBM, which was able to reskill its workforce in essential areas like cybersecurity. This has not only brought about improved performance for these job variants but also saw employee satisfaction and retention rates rising equally as well (Alam, 2022;Robert et al., 2024). According to the studies, not only has there been improved performance for these job variants, but employee satisfaction and retention rates have also risen equally well. Besides, Coursera's AI-powered learning path personalization enables higher course completion rates and superior learner outcomes. For instance, the University of Queensland leveraged AI to analyze data on student performance and enable personalized interventions that drastically reduced dropout rates (Crawford et al., 2024). This collection of case studies illustrates very clearly the opportunities brought about by AI in increasing learning efficiency, improving educational outcomes, and streamlining education trajectories to meet labor-market needs better. Using concrete examples of successful implementations allows us to shift this appreciation toward revealing AI's potential as applied to micro-credentialing. The use of AI in education has to be balanced in a manner such that it becomes an instrument of empowerment but not exclusion. Policies and practices have to be aimed at putting AI tools within the reach of all demographic and socioeconomic groups without exception so as not to worsen already existing inequalities. Those must include, but will not be limited to, the deployment of necessary hardware and software, as well as training and support to educators and learners. Only such inclusive strategies can make full use of the potential of AI to democratize education so that advanced, personalized learning opportunities are within everyone's reach, regardless of background or resources.Spotlighting the Understudied Aspects of AI in Micro-CredentialingIdentifying and mitigating this research gap is necessary to maximize the benefits that will accrue to the educational frameworks. In fact, it can even be called for longitudinal research into these dynamics, pinpointing the necessity of assessing the long-term implications that micro-credentials have on the equity in career growth, income increments, and job security. Finally, equity and access around these programs warrant further research. With AI-driven micro-credentialing, it needs to be understood how people from underrepresented groups are affected, which includes minorities, those in rural areas, and those with low economic statuses. This calls for understanding the possible barriers such groups may face and aiming to reduce them in fostering inclusive educational opportunities.Further research also needs to be carried out on the equity and potential biases of AI algorithms used within micro-credentialing to ensure that the recommendations and assessments are bias-free. In addition, AI-enhanced learning outcomes need to be compared to their traditional counterparts to establish the contexts in which micro-credentials offer unique advantages or otherwise fall short. There is also a need to investigate the psychological impact of the personalized AI learning systems in terms of motivation and anxiety in order to ensure that such innovations promote learner well-being effectively. Other areas of critical research will include acceptance of micro-credentials in different sectors, development of appropriate regulatory and ethical frameworks, economic analysis of implementation costs and benefits of introducing AI, changing roles for educators, and technical challenges of integrating AI within existing infrastructure. Filling these gaps would significantly help in enhancing understanding and applications of AI in education towards accelerating the power of micro-credentials to revolutionize learning and career development in a holistic manner.Challenges of data privacy, equity, and algorithmic bias associated with AI-driven micro-credentialing demand a multi-dimensional approach. Robust encryption techniques, transparency about disposing of data, and explicit consent of the user at each point are some measures to allay concerns over data privacy. Following the principles of privacy by design, it is incumbent upon educational institutions and platforms to rigorously work along the lines of regulations like GDPR. Particularly in this sphere, such equity issues relate to the digital divide and raise focused initiatives for increasing access to technology and digital literacy within acting communities. The collaboration of the government, educational institutions, and tech companies can facilitate the spreading of more affordable devices and reliable internet access. To address algorithm bias, diversified representative datasets have to be developed for AI systems' training. Continuous monitoring and auditing of AI algorithms would help detect and rectify biases, thereby arriving at impartial judgments. Moreover, such policy regulatory frameworks for this field and ethical guidelines will also enhance transparency and accountability for AI uses. If all these aspects are kept in mind with appropriate care, the use of AI-based microcredentialing can be broadly inclusive, fair, privacy-preserving, and hence more effective and trustworthy.The integration of AI into micro-credentialing will be one of the breakthrough elements in the push toward more personalized, efficient, and inclusive education systems. It provides a more dynamic and responsive learning environment through the closer alignment of educational pathways with the needs and realities of the individual within the market. The bottom line: Issues of privacy, equity, and access need to be part of the new paradigm but are surmountable with well-planned policy and careful, ethical technology use. All these players-policy makers, educators, technologists, and learners themselvesneed to converge their efforts in order to realize the promise of AI in making educational experiences increasingly personal, accessible, and effective for all. What the AI revolution in micro-credentialing portends, therefore, is not just the business of new technologies but a full reinvention of how education can be the bridge to opportunity and success in a world of increasing complexity.","['revolution', 'micro-credentialing:', 'personalized', 'learning', 'paths']"
Competency-Based Medical Training in Anesthesiology: Has It Delivered on the Promise of Better Education?,2022,"See Article, page 220 It has been >40 years since the term ""competency-based medical education"" (CBME) first appeared in a forward-thinking report prepared for the World Health Organization.1 This landmark report described a curriculum that was organized around defined clinical competencies that were acquired through a mastery learning approach. The goal of this new curriculum was to produce a better health professional who could practice proficiently across the breadth of medicine and contextualize care to meet local patient needs.1 CBME was described as an outcome-based approach, in contrast to the traditional time-based medical training approach. The competency-focused outcomes were designed to prepare physicians with all the expected competencies, beyond medical knowledge only, to better serve society.2 As we celebrate the centenary edition of Anesthesia & Analgesia, it should be recognized that CBME represents only a small portion of the advances in graduate medical education. The time-based training with which most anesthesiologists are familiar dates back to the Flexner report,3 released a decade before the first issue of this journal. Flexner's survey of the state of medical education at the turn of the 20th century led to a standardization of medical school curricula. Out of that report also arose the concept of clerkships and the necessity for innovations in medical education to support the advancements in medicine. CBME may represent the evolution in medical education of the 21st century. The goal of a postgraduate CBME curriculum in anesthesiology is to explicitly outline, teach, assess, and provide feedback to residents so they can graduate with the competencies to ensure safe and effective anesthesiology practices.4 Today, the national standards of postgraduate anesthesiology training have embraced a CBME model in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.5–9 With this expanding global experience with CMBE, have the theoretical advantages to this approach translated into practice? Moreover, are there any unintended consequences to this paradigm shift in medical education? In this article, we highlight the progress that has been made toward the integration of CBME curricula into the postgraduate training of anesthesiologists. This article outlines several of the benefits of a transition to CBME and explores its challenges to programs, faculty, and residents. We also discuss important areas for the future development of medical education, including innovations in resident assessments and considerations to ensure training programs remain relevant and well positioned to prepare anesthesiologists to meet future health care needs. WHERE IS CBME NOW? Several countries have concurrently developed requirements and standards for CBME anesthesiology training. A recent comparison of the competency frameworks of CBME programs in Europe, the United States, and Canada demonstrated that >90% of the clinical competencies that were identified as necessary skills were common to all 3 regions.10 Core anesthesia competencies, for example, perioperative anesthesia care, managing critically ill patients in acute care settings and airway management, demonstrated a high degree of overlap and importance between regions. Conversely, specific competencies, such as navigating health care systems and incorporating practice-based learning, varied between countries, with particular emphasis in the United States, and were contextualized to culture and practice.10 The commonalities articulated by CBME training programs that are located in different countries provide an opportunity to explore international competency standards for anesthesiology postgraduate training. In addition, a universal consensus regarding the necessary core clinical competencies could facilitate potential reciprocity of postgraduate training between jurisdictions and portability to practice. Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) have supported CBME by organizing trainee assessments around specific and tangible clinical encounters. These clinical activities can be observed and fully entrusted to trainees to perform unsupervised after all the required knowledge, skills, and behaviors of the encounter are achieved. EPAs can enable assessment in CBME by mapping to all the desired competencies.11 Furthermore, they can be scaffolded for demonstrable progression of increased resident autonomy and responsibility in patient care on the path to independent practice.12 The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada Competence by Design framework for anesthesiology training was implemented nationally in 2017. Currently, the curriculum includes 49 EPAs that are distributed through the 4 stages of residency training (Table 1).13 Most of these EPAs are designed as observable clinical encounters. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestones Project described the anesthesiology competencies to provide a nationally shared framework. However, the project did not describe the methods to assess milestones in practice, nor how to determine whether the milestones have been achieved. More recently, 20 EPAs that map to the ACGME anesthesiology milestones have been rigorously developed to facilitate resident assessment by anesthesiology training programs in the United States.11 Table 1. - Four Stages of Postgraduate Training in Competence by Design and Associated Number of Anesthesiology EPAs, Mapped to Traditional Training Competency by design stages Mapping to traditional PGY in training Number of anesthesiology EPAs Transition to discipline PGY 1 3 EPAs Foundations of discipline PGY 1–2 16 EPAs Core of discipline PGY 3–5 25 EPAs Transition to practice PGY 5 5 EPAs Abbreviations: EPA, entrusted professional activity; PGY, postgraduate year.Adapted from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.13 One critical enabler to CBME is the workplace-based assessment (WBA). By observing residents in the complex and authentic clinical practice environment, WBA tools serve as an important measure to monitor their training and document their achievement of competencies. WBAs have incorporated entrustment scales, which focus an assessor's judgment on progression toward independent practice by asking whether a resident is capable of completing a task at a defined level of supervision. By anchoring a faculty member's observation of a resident's performance to a required level of supervision, the reliability between assessors is improved.14 Several entrustment-based WBA scales, with robust validity data for anesthesia training, have been developed to assess the perioperative care competencies of residents and monitor their progress during training.15–17 Ideally, CBME is delivered with numerous WBAs, including detailed and constructive narratives. These formative assessments (assessments for learning) serve to provide frequent targeted feedback and tailored coaching to residents, which guide their development of competencies and support mastery learning.18 Individual assessments, with quantitative performance ratings and qualitative narratives, are also collected over time for summative purposes (assessments of learning).19 Competence committees require sufficient aggregated data to make summative judgments of the residents of their program, such as promotion through a training program and documenting progress toward readiness for independent practice. Early reports suggest that CBME trainees are receiving more constructive feedback and that CBME assessment systems are also providing training programs with more information to make summative decisions about their residents.20 WHAT APPEARS TO BE WORKING WITH CBME? Given these early days of CBME adoption, there is limited information available regarding the experiences and perceptions of residents and faculty supervisors. A survey from 2016 indicated that anesthesiology residents in the United States were satisfied with their CBME training programs and were confident that they would master the ACGME competencies.21 CBME residents from several Canadian programs, including anesthesia, identified that they valued frequent meaningful feedback from supervisors through formative assessments, as this information helped to modify their behaviors.22 Interestingly, anesthesiology residents prefer specific supervisor feedback comments over a rating of their performance on an entrustment scale. They explained that the qualitative feedback shifted their orientation from a focus on achievement to one of self-improvement.23 This result is encouraging, as it suggests that residents are embracing a growth-oriented mindset,18 which is a driving goal of CBME. One year after the implementation of CBME, a report from a single Canadian anesthesiology program suggested that faculty had a favorable view, perceiving that the curriculum improved the performance of junior residents and clarified expectations.24 Faculty also appreciated the resident-directed and centered-learning process, as they noticed residents seemed motivated, ""taking their learning in their own hands and presenting it to staff.""24 WHAT AREAS IN CBME NEED MORE WORK? A competency-based assessment of a trainee is complex and requires multiple approaches to ensure a valid reflection of their performance. The exponential increase in the number of assessments required to support CBME has created challenges for residents, faculty, and programs. The duality in the purpose of assessments (formative versus summative) can foster tensions, as stakeholders may view the purposes and stakes of the ""point in time"" WBA observations differently. Residents can perceive any, or all, formative assessments, which provide input into competence committee decisions as summative and are therefore high stakes.23 This viewpoint can make them reluctant to engage with the assessment results as a learning opportunity. One unintended consequence of this perception is that trainees might seek out lenient assessors or seek to perform simpler cases to demonstrate their competencies. Such an approach can interfere with the intended effect of supporting a resident's learning and growth.25 Furthermore, EPAs may not be perceived as low stakes when they result in low ratings or when a minimum number of assessments are required to ensure advancement through the training program. Anesthesiology residents in Canada have expressed concerns that EPAs and the associated entrustment scales contribute to a ""tick box exercise,"" in which they are simply attempting to acquire assessments.23 In addition, anesthesiology residents reported that the quantitative entrustment scales failed to provide them with meaningful information about how they were progressing during training.23 Regrettably, some residents find it onerous to obtain feedback or an explanation for performance ratings.22 Finally, the burden of WBAs has been described to increase workloads, disrupt clinical workflow, and foster assessment fatigue in learners and their faculty.22,23,26,27 All of these challenges threaten the intended growth mindset of CBME. Faculty, who likely trained in programs that used a time-based paradigm, have expressed concerns about the lack of evidence to support the shift to CBME.24 In surveys, faculty have acknowledged an apprehension about the considerable amount of resources that are necessary to successfully implement and manage CBME.24 Furthermore, they recognized a mismatch in the perception of the goals and responsibilities in a CBME model compared to residents.24 CBME represents a culture change for both faculty and learners, with both groups benefiting from a growth-oriented mindset and a partnership approach to assessments.28 Faculty development is critical to appreciate that the assessment and coaching that concomitantly occur during WBAs are not discrete and independent events. Rather, they should be seen as overlapping and interdependent processes to support resident growth. As mentioned above, entrustment scales are anchored to the required level of supervision. They aim to reduce assessor bias and may require less faculty training than a subjective scale that asks raters to make assessments against ""meeting expectations"" for postgraduate years.14 Nevertheless, a recent study suggests that faculty continue to align their assessments to preexisting cognitive benchmarks, such as a resident's year of training, rather than the observed clinical performance.29 Even when assessments are viewed as having no consequence for a resident's progression in training, anesthesia faculty are often unwilling to identify competency deficits, despite patient safety having been demonstrably compromised.30 Moreover, >25% of anesthesiology residents received the same rating across the ACGME milestones, a phenomenon described as ""straightlining,"" compared to <10% straightlined response among other specialties, providing better discrimination between their trainees.31 Analysis of longitudinal anesthesiology milestones data in 5 US programs demonstrated that the frequency of straightlining varied significantly by program, from 9% to 57%.32 While this could represent a true lack in variation in resident competence, straightlining conflicts with the CBME concept that trainees progress at different stages for various competencies. Rather, straightlining may suggest that individualized resident assessments are not occurring or that programs lack a reliable method for assessing specific milestones. It could also indicate that Clinical Competency Committees are influenced by the halo effect and applying an overall impression, or that milestone level is still being assessed based on the year of training. Programs should be exploring their assessment and competence rating culture to examine overall rating patterns, thereby searching for root causes to identify contextualized local solutions. Rater errors and biases can have serious implications for the validity and defensibility of the eventual high-stakes summative judgments made using these assessments. Thus, training programs and competence committees should attempt to identify their outlier faculty with leniency or stringency biases. CBME resident assessment data can also be reconsidered as a measure of faculty performance. Auditing the quality and quantity of the assessments provided to residents can provide context and feedback for faculty.12,20 Training of faculty assessors may be a way to reduce rater bias and encourage more meaningful learner assessments. After a short educational intervention for academic anesthesiologists, the quality of their feedback provided to a simulated anesthesiology resident significantly improved, and professionalism lapses were better addressed.33 Disappointingly, studies in nonanesthesia programs have reported an inconsistent impact of rater training, unable to inform evidence and best practices for optimal format or duration of an intervention.34 The shift to CBME was partly driven by a movement for public accountability in medicine. Accordingly, the high-stakes decision of confirming an anesthesiology resident's readiness for independent clinical practice requires robust evidence.19 To allow competency committees to make summative decisions, a resident's education portfolio should include workplace assessments completed by a variety of faculty across a wide breadth of clinical contexts.12 Unfortunately, programs are struggling to use the assessment data received for these purposes.20 In the absence of platforms to manage and interpret the realms of data, programs can be challenged to support the growth of their residents and to make confident valid decisions on readiness for practice. A central goal of competency-based, time-variable medical education is graded increases in clinical and professional responsibility by entrusting trainees to provide patient care without supervision. Regrettably, the realization of a fully competency-based, time-variable system is constrained by current licensing and certification requirements and program accreditation systems that rely on fixed durations of training. Consequently, we still primarily rely on high-stakes, standardized, summative examinations for anesthesiology certification. Modernization of this approach could permit that evidence of a resident's achievement of certain competencies be used to grant a graduated license or microcertification to allow them to take on greater clinical autonomy.35,36 Logistically, this would require close collaboration and innovation between programs and various regulatory bodies. WHAT WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR CBME? Entrustment decisions are of particular importance in anesthesiology, in which patient care often occurs in high-stakes environments. In these dynamic, complex, acute, and rapidly changing situations, WBAs may not always be possible or appropriate. Thus, there are advantages to increasing the diversity of CBME assessment modalities. Simulation can be used to provide additional assessment data of technical and nontechnical skills.37 Simulation can also be beneficial when certain clinical events are critical but rare, and when it is not appropriate or safe to delegate responsibilities to a trainee solely for the purpose of undertaking an assessment.38 In anesthesiology and emergency medicine training, in which patient care is also acute and dynamic, simulation-based milestone assessments have been shown to be valid measures of resident competency and correlate with clinical evaluations.39–41 Relatedly, the performance on a regular objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)-based milestone assessment can also provide evidence of longitudinal growth in competence in anesthesiology residents.42 In Canada, the national CBME curriculum includes 5 mandatory, standardized mannequin-based simulation scenarios.43 Although the impact of simulated performance outcomes on certification decisions has yet to be determined, every Canadian anesthesiology resident must undertake these simulation scenarios before completing their training. Similarly, artificial intelligence is now being explored to enhance resident assessment through testing knowledge and observing workplace performance. For example, by training machines to understand speech patterns such as time spent talking or interruptions, a resident could receive specific feedback about their interpersonal communication directly after seeing a patient.44 Machine learning is also being explored to provide learning analytics to aggregated CBME assessment data to analyze and predict a trainee's EPA progress to support residents and programs.45 As our experience deepens with CBME, more work is needed to demonstrate that the shift to CBME improves trainee performance and patient outcomes. Since operating room metrics are often used to assess the quality of patient care, one anesthesiology program in the United States examined perioperative databases to assess the efficiency of resident performance. This demonstrated that patient emergence time decreased by 28 seconds for each year of training.46 While this difference was statistically but not likely clinically significant, it serves as an example of exploring patient outcomes as a measure of competency. Patients are also increasingly involved in competency-based resident assessments, most often in the form of multisource feedback.47 Compared to physicians, who focus on medical expertise, patients provide greater comments on resident professional behaviors and communication skills in their assessments.47 Given the required investment by all stakeholders for successful CBME implementation, meaningful patient-focused outcomes still need to be identified to ensure a demonstrable return on that investment. In view of the exponential growth in medical knowledge and evolving patient needs, CBME must be agile and responsive. Nearly a decade after the original Milestones Project, the ACGME framework was recently revised to resolve some mismatch between the competencies and expectations for current and future graduates. The Anesthesiology Milestones now include previously absent critical skills and also reflect advances in clinical practice, such as point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and electronic medical records (Table 2).48 Table 2. - Six Domains of Competency in Anesthesiology Milestones 2.0, and Associated Subcompetencies Patient care PC 1: Preanesthetic evaluation PC 2: Perioperative care and management PC 3: Application and interpretation of monitors PC 4: Intraoperative care PC 5: Airway management PC 6: Point-of-care ultrasound PC 7: Situational awareness and crisis management PC 8: Postoperative care PC 9: Critical care PC 10: Regional (peripheral and neuraxial) anesthesia Medical knowledge MK 1: Foundational knowledge MK 2: Clinical reasoning Systems-based practice SBP 1: Patient safety and quality improvement SBP 2: System navigation for patient-centered care SBP 3: Physician role in health care systems Practice-based learning and improvement PBLI 1: Evidence-based and informed practice PBLI 2: Reflective practice and commitment to personal growth Professionalism PROF 1: Professional behavior and ethical principles PROF 2: Accountability/conscientiousness PROF 3: Well-being Interpersonal and communication skills ICS 1: Patient- and family-centered communication ICS 2: Interprofessional and team communication ICS 3: Communication within health care systems Abbreviations: ICS, interpersonal and communication skills; MK, medical knowledge; PBLI, practice-based learning and improvement; PC, patient care; PROF, professionalism; SBP, system-based practice.Adapted from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.9 More nuanced, but perhaps more important to all specialties, is the increasing evidence of racial disparities that exist across the spectrum of health care. Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) encounter barriers to access surgical procedures, while also having higher rates of maternal mortality and worse surgical outcomes.49,50 As we continue to examine and face the legacy and persistence of structural racism in health care, it is clear that medical education institutions have an important role to play. Programs must be invested in training anesthesiologists with the competencies to provide effective and equitable care to BIPOC and other marginalized populations. It behooves us to iteratively revise CBME curriculum to reflect advances in practice (eg, POCUS). Analogous curriculum updates are also required to address social determinants of health (eg, health inequities in perioperative and maternal care for racialized persons) and to support antiracism in medical education.51,52 Finally, no discussion of CBME is complete without considering the abandonment of time as the framework of postgraduate training. If nothing else, the disruption caused by the global pandemic has served to clarify the need to innovate and utilize the opportunity of CBME for flexibility in training time and individualized curricula based on competence. Programs and accrediting and licensing bodies may need to consider the suppleness of time offered by CBME. This would allow them to capitalize on adding competent anesthesiologists to the workforce when they are ready for independent practice as opposed to a time-based certification date.53 CONCLUSIONS Twenty years ago, CBME was going to dramatically improve medical education to address unsafe, inefficient, and poor-quality health care, all while reforming training systems to ensure that physicians have the skills needed for complex modern practice. The medical education system has since undergone an accelerated transformation. No one will dispute that implementing CBME in anesthesiology programs has proven to be been challenging. Nevertheless, it has provided an explicit and transparent educational framework for residents, faculty, and programs. More work is needed to iteratively build on our early successes and to determine whether CBME produces more competent anesthesiologists to benefit patients and society.

They compared findings with the 2017 guidelines and reported only minimally higher systolic (1–4 mmHg) and slightly lower diastolic (1–3 mmHg) blood pressure readings, arguing that using such real-life data could be used to update paediatric reference intervals. Mitsnefes' study percentiles reflect oscillometric-based scenarios with good agreement to published references. Oscillometric devices, widely used for blood pressure readings in well-resourced countries, determine the mean arterial pressure defined as the maximum amplitude of the pulse wave and use device-specific algorithms rarely validated in children.1Filler G.

There was also no description of the EHR systems, which can be variable in their quality. Lastly, a statistical method was chosen to eliminate outliers. It is not clear if the manufacturers of EHR systems utilize artificial intelligence approaches to identify errors at the time of entry; for example, if a child is 10 years old and accidentally the input reads 173 rather than 137 cm, does the EHR flag this error? One issue that needs further discussion is related to the 95th percentiles of adolescents >14 years as shown in Figure 4 of Mitsnefes' manuscript. The 2017 AAP guidelines have stated that blood pressure norms after age 14 are ≤130/80 mmHg to concur with adult guidelines, but previous guidelines have allowed for higher 95th percentiles for tall adolescents.2Flynn J.T. Kaelber D.C.

In view of the acceleration of stature with every generation and the fact that blood pressure is strongly correlated with height, future research needs to address whether it is appropriate to have a unified cut-off of 130/80 mmHg. In conclusion, new paediatric blood pressure reference ranges were generated from over one million measurements recorded in EHRs of apparently healthy children served at eight USA children's hospitals. There was good agreement with the 2017 AAP guidelines.

Persuasive Technology,2022,"On Sunday, October 3, 2021, a former Facebook employee blasted the social media company on the television show 60 Minutes, alleging it was concealing information on risks to users of Facebook-owned platforms.1 Relying on internal documents obtained while employed at Facebook, the whistleblower alleged that Facebook was misleading the public and its investors. She also argued that Facebook had a destructive global social impact, contributing to political polarization in the United States, and through Instagram, harming teens based on Facebook’s own internal research.1 The whistleblower further alleged that Facebook repeatedly “chooses profits over safety.”2Why should the Facebook story be of interest to critical care nurses, and what does it have to do with nursing practice or patients? The topic is vitally important, as the issues outlined by the whistleblower involve more than just Facebook or even social media platforms; the root of the problem lies in what is called persuasive technology, which is spreading across the health care industry.Persuasive technology refers to “interactive computing systems designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviors.”3 Coined by Stanford University researcher B.J. Fogg in 2003, persuasive technology integrates behavioral science into the user interface of technology products such as social media, mobile health apps, and wearables.4 The resulting design is intended to persuade people to change behaviors, attitudes, or both. The cautionary tale of Facebook illustrates why it is important to examine its use in health care in order to prevent or mitigate the downsides.In 2014, a column of Technology Today talked about the history of significant innovations being associated with new perils.5 Examples of historical innovations included discovery of fire, which enabled global migration but also led to destruction of crops and housing, as well as injuries and deaths of people and animals. Cars and planes enhanced the mobility of people and goods around the world but also created new modes of accidents, injury, and death.In 2020, Technology Today examined behavioral change techniques employed in mobile health apps.6,7 Effective use of these techniques in apps gives consumers better tools for managing their health-related behaviors. The underlying technology used to change people’s behavior in health apps involves persuasive technology.Computers were not initially intended to be used to persuade people. They were created to collect, store, and retrieve data as well as perform mathematical calculations. With the development of the internet and the proliferation of websites, a need to track and sort content rapidly emerged.8 As the number of websites and the volume of competing content grew, the need to attract consumers intensified, and persuasion followed.8 Amazon is probably the best example of a plaform that sorts content and deploys persuasion.As an online retailer, Amazon’s goal is to persuade users to purchase products. This is why, when using the Amazon app or website, you see suggested products, subscription offers, “frequently bought together” items, user ratings, feedback, and pictures.9 Today, persuasive technology is everywhere, from mobile phones to computerized signs along roadways that inform drivers of their speed to persuade them to follow the speed limit.3It is important to note that persuasive technology involves planned persuasion3 and a predetermined goal for measurable changes in behaviors and/or attitudes. Persuasion is not an unintentional consequence of using the application,3 it is the goal.Knowledge of persuasive technology, including its risks, is essential for nurse informaticists; for critical care nurses, it is important to recognize when it is being used to persuade them to make a particular decision or take a specific action. The following discussion examines features of persuasive technology and how they work.A systematic review on persuasive technologies used in mobile health applications promoting physical activity illustrates design features used to persuade.10 The researchers categorized persuasive design features into 4 areas: primary task support, dialogue support, system credibility support, and social support.10 Primary task support involves design features that enable the user to successfully achieve the task for which the application was developed, such as self-managing diabetes.10 Dialogue support encourages users through social or interpersonal interaction such as prompts, suggestions, and reminders and should include feedback on progress.10 System credibility support involves persuasive design features that indicate to the user that the application is credible.10 Persuasive design features that leverage social support to motivate users to achieve their desired goals include social comparison and competition.10Matthews et al10 found that the most common persuasive design feature in applications promoting physical activity was self-monitoring, a focus supported by a qualitative study by Dennison et al11 reporting smartphone app users considered self-monitoring an important tool in helping them modify their behavior. Participants reported high value for being able to record and track their individual behavior and goals, including access to advice and information.11 The application used individual user data to engage users via praise, rewards, reminders, and suggestions.11Matthews et al10 found that the persuasive feature most often missing in mobile health apps promoting physical activity was system credibility support, which provides trustworthiness, authority and expertise, third-party endorsement, and verifiability in the mobile app. Users evaluated trustworthiness in apps based on the accuracy of data collected as well as a professional or scientific appearance. Authority and expertise of apps were measured by users as those developed by reputable sources or experts and those offering access to information from authoritative resources.10 Third-party endorsement was identified by users as apps with an endorsement by a known institution. External links to endorsements afforded verifiability for users.10Thus, persuasive technology comprises many design features, and typically, a combination of these features as opposed to a single feature creates the best user outcomes or attainment of the desired goals.10 Underlying and enabling persuasive design features in technology are algorithms.The Facebook whistleblower described the danger as the algorithms not the content.12 Algorithms, or a “set of instructions used to retrieve information that has been stored inside of a data structure,”8 are how persuasive technologies decide what content to present to particular users.8 She went on to state that Facebook is overly reliant on algorithms used in their artificial intelligence systems that they acknowledge will likely catch no more than 10% to 20% of harmful content.13Algorithms function in different ways, but their purpose in social media is to deliver relevant content to users as measured by user engagement.14 To accomplish this, social media algorithms may consider the user’s previous areas of interest, data from the user’s profile, or the habits of users with similar interests. Algorithms can also filter to context; “they can individuate personal data such as a user’s exact geographic location in order to include it in the algorithmic calculations.”14The quality of an algorithm, how well it does its work, is directly proportional to the quality of the results delivered. In other words, it is a measure of user engagement. Whether the content is good or bad, accurate or inaccurate, is not the goal; rather, the goal is how well the user is engaged. That is why the whistleblower called out algorithms as more important than content.Mobile health apps, like social media platforms, also seek to keep users engaged. Maintaining patient engagement with persuasive technology is important with mobile health apps, as it impacts patient outcomes. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes found higher levels of patient engagement were associated with better short-term and long-term hemoglobin A1c.15 Thus, understanding the significance of algorithms in persuasive technology used in health care is important, as it enables effective decision-making and changes in behavior that result in better patient outcomes.Although Facebook and social media may be familiar to most nurses, the underlying persuasive technology and algorithms may not. Terms used to describe these include invisible, manipulative, and induced behavioral change and thinking. The goal should be to make persuasive technologies transparent, beneficial, and effective in improving patient outcomes, and to avoid harm. Knowing what underlies technology used in nursing practice is important in ensuring the desired results. The next column of Technology Today delves deeper into technology algorithms commonly employed by nurses in practice of which they may be unaware. It includes an important case of persuasive technology commonly used by acute and critical care nurses. We are now officially practicing nursing in the digital age.","['persuasive', 'technology']"
Healthcare's Future Depends on Today's Successful Innovations,2023,"With this issue, the American College of Health-care Executives begins the 40th year of Frontiers of Health Services Manage-ment, serving since its inception as an invaluable source of information and facilitating the exchange of ideas among healthcare leaders. Through the decades, Frontiers has made a lasting impact on the landscape of healthcare management. With deep dedication and expertise, its editors, editorial review board members, and contributors have all served to maintain the quality and utility of its content. Frontiers aims to stay true to the promise made by John R. Griffith, LFACHE, founding editor, in his first editorial: ""Frontiers will strive to be practical in content without being expedient or superficial and academic in thoroughness without being wordy or dogmatic."" Given the shifting healthcare landscape, healthcare organizations must engage in continuous learning. Their leaders must gather and incorporate new information, adapt practices based on evidence, and strive for ongoing improvement to enhance patient outcomes—all while optimizing operations and overall performance. Frontiers has also been continuously learning and has shared many innovations along the way. The original format of a couple of perspectives on a central issue and commentaries in response to those perspectives has evolved to the current four or five single-topic articles and a related case study. All are written by healthcare leaders, for healthcare leaders. A commitment to innovation also was evident in the recent three-issue series on ESG (environmental, social, governance) concerns—a topic of growing global importance. The ESG series has been so well received that the articles will be packaged with additional content into a special book this fall. This book will engage and inspire current and future healthcare leaders to consider the impact of ESG on healthcare, and the impact of healthcare on ESG. Innovation: What It Is, How It Happens Typically, innovation is equated with multimillion-dollar investments and staff redeployment. That assumption can have a chilling effect on the necessary advancement of healthcare. More accurately, innovation is about generating fresh ideas and implementing significant improvements in the way things are done. A product, process, business model, or organizational strategy of any size that is novel, original, and valuable can bring about a positive transformation and drive progress. The starting point to the achievement of those meaningful and beneficial outcomes is a willingness to challenge existing norms or paradigms. How can innovation happen in uncertain times? Disrupting the status quo is both the answer and the challenge. Innovation means change, and in healthcare, change on any scale can be arduous. There are risks, too, especially when interdependencies among departments, roles, professions, processes, and the resistance to change are not understood. Tinkering with one part of the system may lead to unintended effects that ripple throughout an organization. Change is made even harder within healthcare's stringent legal and regulatory environment and requires careful planning to remain in full compliance, which adds yet another layer of complexity. Nonetheless, innovation happens in healthcare every day. On the one hand, healthcare organizations have no choice but to constantly adapt to changes. The forces of science and technology advancements, a pandemic, regulatory requirements, and shifts in patient needs and expectations are relentless. The flexibility to cope with evolving conditions and deliver effective care leads to change fatigue among employees. On the other hand, resource limitations can push innovation and the associated changes to the back seat, behind the status quo, since it is not always possible to deploy scarce human capital or suggest changes to ingrained routines and established ways of doing business. How can healthcare organizations balance the risks and rewards of innovation? This issue of Frontiers explores that question. In This Issue As we reflect on the remarkable contributions made by Frontiers over the years, we celebrate its significant impact on the community and its unwavering commitment to the pursuit of knowledge with the first of four trips into the archives. From the inaugural issue in 1983, we excerpt a piece titled ""Investor-owned versus Not-for-Profit Hospitals: What Are the Issues?,"" which fits nicely with the discussion of the balance between hospitals' social and economic responsibilities in this issue of Frontiers. Next, Monica Wharton, FACHE, COO and executive vice president at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare (MLH) and Paula Jacobs, vice president of Process Improvement and Innovation at MLH, describe how their system promotes innovation and innovative thinking. To identify new ideas, solve problems, and implement solutions, innovation requires employee engagement because it is additional work, she explains. The extra effort is rewarded at MLH with impressive results. Brent Ibata, FACHE, consultant, and 2023 chair of the Scientific Committee for the DNV Healthcare Advisory Board, Jim Olver, PhD, associate professor at the College of William and Mary, and Scott Kashman, FACHE, market president and CEO of Dominic Health Services and St. Dominic Hospital, dismiss the assumption that a lot of resources are required to nurture innovation. One way to kick-start innovation is to explore the toolkit and instructions they provide here to foster a culture for creative inquiry and develop a low-cost in-house innovation laboratory. The issue continues with a question-and-answer session with Karen Tilstra, PhD, cofounder of the Florida Hospital Innovation Lab in Orlando (recently restructured under AdventHealth's ownership). Dr. Tilstra makes the business case for innovation. She describes the link between mission and innovation and explains how organizations can make innovation part of their operations. To advance innovation, she recommends that leaders foster a culture that supports innovation, embrace collaboration and partnerships, encourage staff engagement, and take advantage of external funding and grants. Martin Fattig, CEO of Nemaha County Hospital (NCH), a critical access hospital in Auburn, Nebraska, contributes the case study for this issue. For more than a decade, NCH has been nationally recognized as a most-wired hospital. Fattig describes how NCH leverages financial, operational, quality, and clinical data from its wired systems and external data sources and collaborates across state lines to inform decision-making and innovation. As an added feature to this issue, we include an excerpt from the upcoming ESG book. Monica Nakielski, ESG and sustainability adviser, draws from her experience as vice president of sustainability at Advocate Aurora Health. She parses the differences that define ESG, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility and describes how healthcare organizations can incorporate these frameworks into their operations—particularly regarding governance and enterprise risk management. ESG models and developing approaches will require continuing attention and innovation in all healthcare organizations. Going Forward: Putting Innovation into Motion Healthcare leaders are working across the continuum of care on the current challenges in healthcare delivery—access, costs, equity, fragmented care delivery, quality and safety, cybersecurity, workforce shortages, and chronic disease management—to name a few. Despite the challenges, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic showed the world that, out of necessity, healthcare can rapidly adopt creative ideas to improve its effectiveness. With innovations such as telemedicine and remote monitoring, healthcare organizations can enhance access to care, particularly for underserved populations. In-house initiatives, collaborations with partners, and grant programs support efforts to: improve internet connectivity for patients by providing cellular devices with data plans so that they are not excluded from virtual care options; address social needs to improve healthcare outcomes; and develop chatbots and apps for healthcare appointment scheduling and patient outreach to give people the intuitive interactions they already experience in online retail. Innovations in delivery models, payment systems, and value-based care can mitigate the financial burdens in healthcare. Creative health systems are supporting the development of personalized and preventive care strategies, empowering individuals to manage chronic diseases effectively by: deploying interdisciplinary professional teams in acute care discharge and follow-up to reduce readmissions; enrolling patients with chronic diseases in specialized training programs for evidence-based self-care to address social and behavioral determinants of health and to help them achieve their health goals; and delivering hospital care in homes with improved patient outcomes, lower costs, and high patient satisfaction. Innovators like Fattig are leveraging technology and data analytics to improve care coordination, patient safety, quality of care, and employee well-being. They are innovating by: optimizing shift schedules and workflows for licensed professional staff and identifying opportunities for better employee engagement; using robotics to relieve professionals of repetitive nonclinical work; and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce the provider documentation burden, flag potential safety issues, and refine the supply chain. Amid this progress, many challenges emerge, reappear, or persist and demand new ideas and solutions. In sum, innovation is compulsory and it must be continuous. What has worked before may be approaching or be well past an expiration date on its effectiveness. As this issue of Frontiers illustrates, innovation and organizational culture that support creative problem-solving can flourish with or without large investments. The work isn't easy (although, as Ibata points out, it can be fun). Healthcare leaders must practice effective communication and engage all stakeholders because scaling the innovations that are to come require close attention to healthcare's most valuable resource, our people.

The prevalence of IoT in the facility services industry,2020,"There are many studies that analyze the impact of digitization on work processes. Most of these studies assume that routine tasks will be the most likely victim of this revolution. Drastic changes and shifts in skills will be required from workers, who are used to completing often repetitive tasks. (Nagl, Titelbach, & Valkova, 2017) (Stopajnik & Redlein, Current Labour Market Situation and upcoming Trends in the European Facility Service Industry, 2017) (Frey & Osborne, 2013).Consulting firms like EY recently published reports on the progress of digitization in the real estate industry (Herrenkohl, Magrans, Buisman, & Banerjee, 2017). These reports often state that the industry is neither taking care of nor preparing for the changes (Nagl, Titelbach, & Valkova, 2017).In Europe and the US around 10% of all employees work in the facility services industry, making the outsourced FS industry the 3th largest with regards to employment in the EU (Stopajnik & Redlein, 2017). Due to demographic changes and the lack of skilled people in this industy (comprising of 14.5 million employees in the EU), the application of new technologies is a vital strategy for future proofing this sector (Selinger, Sepulveda, & Buchan, 2013).In order to determine how far digitization has progressed in the facility services industry, a research project was started at TU Wien two years ago. According to this ongoing research (of which this paper is a part), digitization has two major areas of impact.This paper focuses on the second item: the impact of new technologies on service provisioning, especially with regards to IoT.Typical FS activities as described by the EN15221:4 (Österreichisches Norminstitut, 2007) are more likely to be automated than other activities. Frey and Osborne determined a 50% probability of automation for installation, maintenance, and repair work; a 66% probability of automation for janitors and cleaners; a 94% probability of automatization for first-line supervisors of housekeeping and janitorial work. (Frey & Osborne, 2013)Existing studies show the changes of digitization on the whole FS industry, but not on the individual tasks (Stopajnik & Redlein, Current Labour Market Situation and upcoming Trends in the European Facility Service Industry, 2017) (Stopajnik & Redlein, The Development of the Outsourced Facility Service Industry in Europe, 2017) (Frey & Osborne, 2013). But the estimation of relevant technologies and how they affect which services is necessary to determine how the whole industry will change. The research objectives of this paper are to provide an updated evaluation of relevant smart building technologies, especially with regards to IoT.The main research questions are:The research consisted of multiple steps. First, a questionnaire based on a literature review was developed during a qualitative pre-study. This questionnaire was used in expert interviews which were undertaken with fifty DACH-region Facility Managers during the spring of 2017. The result of these interviews was a list of relevant and upcoming smart building technologies. The expert interviews revealed that many technologies are at present technically feasible or will be soon. Their economic feasibility was still in question.This list was then evaluated by analyzing 705 use cases (as of November 2019), published in white papers, strategy documents of well-established consultancy firms, and scientific journals. The intention of this was on the one hand to collect best use cases in real estate and facility services and to evaluate the list given by the experts on the other. The high sample of more than 700 international use cases ensured an objective perspective and valid data basis. Sources include scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals, strategy documents of scientific and strategy consultancies, and white papers and business project descriptions, including promotional reports, press articles, and project descriptions from councils and communities. The use cases were collected in a Microsoft Access database.This allowed the researchers to analyze the relationships between the services affected and the emerging technologies.The European Standard EN15221:4 (Österreichisches Norminstitut, 2007) was used to determine the facility services. It provides definitions of each service, making it possible to map non facility management use cases on established and clearly described facility services, thereby widening the scope of the study while maintaining data integrity.Finally, the database was used to analyze which technologies are in use and in which facility services they were applied in. This allowed the researchers to analyze the relationship between technologies and services. The survey enables two levels of analysis. Each case is tagged with a specification of the detailed technology used. Then the technologies are grouped into higher technology specifications. This specification of the top level technologies was derived form Deep Shift – Technology Tipping Points and Social Impact which was as published in September 2015 by Klaus Schwab, who names 22 technologies (Schwab, 2015). As soon as a detailed technology is named in more than 5% of use cases, it is shown separately in the result analysis.For a more detailed description of the methodology used please consult Redlein and Grasl (2018).The preliminary literature review in combination with the expert interviews revealed that Sensors/IoT, BIM, Mobile Apps, Robotics, RFID, digitalization/automation, big data, virtual reality (VR), drones, and augmented reality (AR) were considered to be the prevalent emerging technologies. To verify these results, an additional quantitative literature review was conducted. Figure 1 shows which technologies, according to this review, are already widely used.705 use cases were collected and evaluated. The analysis showed that IoT technology is used in nearly a third of all use cases analyzed, swiftly followed by AI. Interestingly, even though BIM was mentioned as a prevalent technology by FS experts, very little uses cases were found. SaaS and cloud computing were not mentioned in the initial survey. This is due to the fact that they are a means to store, access, and provide data and software, and therefore not necessarily considered to be technologies in their own right, but enable the economical feasible use of the other technologies. Machine learning (ML) is treated separately from AI, because it has distinct characteristics and was found in more than 5% of the analyzed case studies, even though it is a subcategory of artificial intelligence. Augmented and virtual reality were grouped together. Technologies like chatbot, RFID, 5G, 3D printing, and LED had fewer than 36 iterations (5% of all use cases) each and as a result were subsumed as “Other without BIM”.IoT sensors and other devices have seen a massive price reduction over the last years. This in combination with the fact that they are self-sufficient with regards to energy and can be easily connected to the WIFI of buildings has further enabled their use (Xu, He, & Li, 2014). These are the main reasons for their frequent mentions in this analysis.AI is also mentioned very often, as is ML. Additionally, chatbots, another form of AI, constitute about 4% of all use case applications. In the last years ML and AI tools have made considerable progress and their abilities have improved massively. They are often used to analyze the data gathered by IoT devices to identify patterns and trigger actions (Moreno, Castaño, Barrero, & Hellín, 2014). Big data also plays a pivotal role in this process, as do mobile apps. These technologies are used to store and access data generated by IoT. It is therefore not surprising that many use cases operate more than one of these technologies simultaneously. For example, Fujitsu produces a device that automatically recognizes patients' statuses, and in case of emergency the relevant people are informed automatically (Fujitsu, 2014). The availability of system solutions has also grown because of cloud computing and SaaS platforms (like IBM Watson), which have seen a massive price reduction over the last years. Instead of investing in hardware and software on premise and a team to run it, companies like Amazon, IBM, etc. provide platforms that offer either computer power only or additional AI/ML environments, that can immediately be used for data analysis and pattern recognition. This enable the economically reasonable use of the other technologies.Robotics, including drones, are also mentioned often in the use cases database. They are mainly used to carry out repetitive and dangerous work, like cleaning windows (Choi & Jung, 2011). New models are more flexible and can cooperate with the FS personnel more easily.Blockchain is mainly mentioned in strategy documents. This technology provides many use cases, especially in the areas of Finance (2511) and Security (2120).Augmented and virtual reality are mainly applied in Training (2523) and Safety (2110). According to the experts, BIM is a dominant technology in FS, however, further research could not support this assumption.Figure 2 shows the occurrence in all use cases as a percentage of the whole number of cases analyzed (n=705). This quantitative literature analysis showed that use cases deploy several technologies simultaneously and are applicable in multiple services. As shown in Figure 2, the services most affected by digitalization are Maintenance and Operation (1160), Energy (1171), Safety (2110), Logistics (2410, 2430, 2440), Security (2120), Customer Experience (2000), and Finance (2511). Many of these services are partly composed of repetitive tasks and are therefore prone to automatization.IoT technology use cases are wide spread across many facility services. Figure 3 shows that Maintenance and Operation (1160) and Energy (1171) are the most important fields of appliance according to our database. The following examples were chosen because they best represent how IoT technology is not only used in FS, but overall changes the way facility services are provided.Maintenance and Operation (1160) profits largely from improved technology. IoT sensors produce accurate data of usage, thereby helping to improve energy consumption and delivering information for optimization. KONE uses IBM Watson IoT sensors and cloud services to improve the running of 1.1 million elevators and escalators worldwide. The sensor data helps to remotely observe machinery, and identify and predict failures before equipment breaks. This allows KONE to schedule maintenance work at times of lower demand, improving overall equipment availability (KONE Corp., 2016).Electric load forecasting is used to anticipate spikes in electricity demand. This is important to ensure a functioning and reliable energy grid and to increase efficiency, saving energy in the process. A research project used mobile phone data, census data, and electric load data to create a model of energy use for Trentino, Italy. The cell phones are used as presence sensors. The data collected from these IoT devices was then analyzed and mapped to create a representation of the time-varying population of Trentino, especially with regards to urban areas. This information was then used to create an accurate forecasting method for electrical demand (Selvarajoo, Schlapfer, & Tan, 2018).Earthquakes are massive threat to people living in areas like Japan, where up to 10.680 earthquakes happen each year. In order to protect citizens, early warning systems are indispensable. The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 1,700 sensors across the country to record and analyze earthquake activity. In addition to these measurements an iPhone app was developed to measure tremors and their effect on buildings' structural integrity. The data from the apps is analyzed using big data tools and SaaS platforms. The goal is to build a fully functioning network, connecting hundreds of thousands of devices to collect data about earthquakes and help to predict where they will hit next and whether buildings are still safe to be operated. (Brown, 2018)Smart home technology is an efficient way to regulate access to sensitive buildings like food producing factories. The brewery Hofstetten, where beer has been brewed since 1449 has decided to digitize its production process and their facilities. The on-site miniserver not only handles temperature monitoring and control to ensure a quality product, but also security functions. Alarm chains are triggered automatically by sensors installed in the facility. These include smoke detectors, window sensors that open and close windows automatically if it rains, and door sensors that alert the responsible personnel if the gate is open after six p.m. by sending a message directly to the phone. (Loxone, 2018)Cape Town in South Africa for example uses IoT and big data coupled with AI and mobile phone apps to automate traffic monitoring in order to communicate traffic status to vehicles on the road. This helps to optimize route planning, cut travel time and therefore reduce emissions. This intelligent traffic management system improves connectivity and air quality in the city. This is exemplary for how IoT data is handled in many use cases (Nasman, Dowling, Combes, & Herweijer, 2017).Gensler outfitted its own New York office with than 1,500 IoT sensors which are connected to lighting and some electrical outlets. This allows the design firm to track daylight levels, occupancy, energy consumption, and temperature. This data is paired with other types of data like card swipes, emails, meeting room bookings and general human resource personnel data, and BIM. Gensler hopes that this data, which can be accessed via mobile app as SaaS, will help them to understand how work is done at the office, how employees use the space provided, and how the space can be adapted over time. The visualization of this data is an important tool for Gensler to make abstract processes tangible and help people make the most of their experience at work, creating a WOW effect not only for visitors but also for employees (Briefel, et al., 2019).These use cases are exemplary for how IoT and other technologies improve and change facility services. Through advanced availability, processes, demand anticipation, analytics, and much more, technology, especially with regards to IoT sensors and data analytics, shift from reactive towards predictive tasks can be enabled, enhancing workflows and improving our daily experiences.Expert interviews and a quantitative literature analysis showed that smart building technologies, especially with regard to IoT, are already widely used. This can be traced to a massive price reduction in sensors and other technologies over the last years, improving amortization rates. The analysis of 705 use case studies showed that IoT, AI, big data, robotics, ML, blockchain, and augmented and virtual reality are important smart building technologies. BIM on the other hand, while often cited by FM publications as important, plays a very minor role in the emerging technology field according to this research.This research shows that IoT is seldom used without a secondary technology to process the data gathered, like big data, AI, or ML. Mobile apps are also used to access and visualize data. This is especially true with regards to Maintenance and Operation (1160), Customer Experience (2000), Marketing and Communication (2540), Logistics (2410, 2430, 2440), Safety (2110), and Security (2120). Energy (1171) and Finance (2511) use cases on the other hand are dominated by a single technology, IoT and blockchain respectively, in many cases without a secondary technology mentioned.A pattern that was observed in the use cases again and again was that IoT sensors collect data, which are then either processed by big data or send to AI/ML for further analysis. Big data is used to store data, while mobile apps are tools to access data either directly from IoT devices or after analytics were conducted.IoT helps to improve facility services, by shifting tasks from reactive towards predictive ones. Processes can be streamlined, made easier and more effective. Data gathered helps to enhance the way people interact with and use facilities.Further research is needed on how this dynamic field will develop in the years to come, which services will change, and how they influx of widely available and easy to use technology will influence the way services are provided.","['prevalence', 'facility', 'services', 'industry']"
New trends in the system regulating the market of bank services,2017,"The severity of the last financial crisis for the European financial markets, the economy, and society makes the scientists and financial analysts start to seek answers with great openness not only to the question of how to reduce its negative effects in the future, but also of how the system regulating financial institutions will look like in the future. The article discusses three options of the positions on the future regulatory tendencies: theoretical alternative, option presented in reports and expert studies, and the version arising from observations of the current practices of functioning of the European banks. The aim of the article is to confront the views on the future trends in the regulation of the banking sector from theoretical, consulting point of view, and the view formulated on the basis of evalua-tion of banking practices. The severity of the last financial crisis for the European financial markets, the economy, and society, which lasts almost 8 years, makes the scientists and financial analysts start to seek answers with great openness not only to the question of how to reduce its negative effects in the future, but also to consider how the system regulating financial institutions will look like in the future. The article presents three options of the positions on the future regulatory tendencies: theoretical alternative, the option presented in reports and expert studies, and the version arising from observations of the current practices of functioning of the European banks. The aim of the article is to confront the views on the future trends in the regulation of the banking sector from the theoretical, consulting point of view, and the view formulated on the basis of evaluation of banking practices. The elaboration presents a working hypothesis that the implemented financial innovations will be the main force driving and influencing concepts, methodology, and the operation of regulatory institutions of the banking sector. The article consists of four, logically related sections. The first assumes that the vision of the regulatory system for bank institutions will result from the interactions of banks and the actions of the regulators. Therefore, a synthetic assessment of the changes that have taken place in the bank regulatory system is presented. The second part highlights the changes in the post-crisis regulations, as the crisis had a strong impact on the shape of the new regulatory architecture. The third part of the elaboration presents the scenarios of the future development of the banking sector and the directions of changes to its regulations. The last part exposes the expectations of the bankers in relation to the key actions of the regulators in the perspective of the nearest 10-15 years. Visions of regulating the banking sector The issue of predicting trends in regulating the banking sector is a serious scientific and research challenge, yet highly troubling and controversial [Gosee, Philon, 2014]. From the nature and characteristics of the regulations, especially those taking the form of legal acts, it appears that the regulators aim at organising and developing the economic life in the longer time. In turn, the changes that presently take place in the conditions of management and on the market of the banking services, are extremely dynamic, and are accompanied by high uncertainty, instability, complexity, and discontinuity. On the one hand, regulations strongly affect the evolution of the market of the banking services, its structure, forms of competition, position of the customer, offered products, risk management. Not to mention one of the basic functions – the impact of regulations on the stabilityand security of the financial sector and the entire social and economic system [Marcinkowska, 2014; Marcinkowska, Wdowiński, Flejterski, Bukowski, Zygierewicz, 2014]. On the other hand, the features of the market, and especially its imperfections and objectives formulated by the political and economic authorities, are usually an essential prerequisite for the development of new regulations. The interdependencies between the trends of the banking services market development and the system of their regulation affect the multidimensional consequences of legislation. Regulations can stimulate the development of the banking sector, become its inhibitor to the development, or contribute to its long-term stagnation, or even lead to its fast destruction. Therefore, it is so important to examine the future regulatory trends, in particular, which regulations are needed, how to develop them efficiently, and how to evaluate their quality, so that the effort of numerous legislative institutions would not turn out to be an irreparable loss of the used resources and the loss of alternative developmental opportunities. Starting point In comparison to the last century, in the foundations and in practice of regulating the banking system, there has been a number of breakthrough and favourable changes in the theoretical, methodical, and institutional area. Theoretical foundations of regulation in the banking sector have developed. The key trends of the theory of regulations are developed: public, private, normative, and positive [see Baldwin, Cave, Lodge, 2012; Maloney, Ferran, Payne, 2015; Harnay, L. Scalon, 2016]. Concepts to develop new regulations are described fairly well. Interesting presentations of these concepts can be found in numerous studies [de Weers, 2011; Kasiewicz, 2016; Masiukiewicz, Morawska, 2015]. When applying these concepts, regulators can refer to ideas, principles, mechanisms, and instruments, within these concepts. They include: • Vertical Enforcement • Horizontal Regulation • Responsive Regulation • Risk-based Regulation • Smart Regulation • Self-Regulation. Evaluating the characteristics of the present conditions of development of the banking sector, there is no doubt that the concepts that provide flexible possibilities to pursue regulatory purposes are useful, and most appropriately reflect the dynamics and threats of the most effective directions of competing of banks. These concepts surely include the concept based on the use of the regulatory risk, which boosts the entire process of elaboration of legislation, concentrates on the responsibility of the regulator, gives the possibility to react to unexpected positive and negative events, and opens wide possibilities to improve the process of regulation for a vast number of stakeholders. It is the most mature concept. Also, a progress in the area of the methods of evaluation of the regulations results, both ex-ante, as well as ex-post, is visible. Next to the two key methodologies: Benefit-Cost Analysis and Impact Assessment, two additional methodologies of complementary nature appeared, which deepen the regulation quality evaluation: the methodology of Regulatory Risk Assessment [Black, 2010; Kasiewicz, 2016], and of Respecting the Principle of Proportionality [Kasiewicz, Kirkliński, Szpringer, 2014]. There is also an almost revolutionary progress in the area of systemic risk modelling [Acharya, Engle, Richardson, 2012; Brunnermeier, 2009]. For centuries, the unquestionable domination of lawyers has been established in the legislative process, and perhaps this is why the aspects of perception and the role of regulatory risk, as the financial and economic category, were completely overlooked or treated as some additional, supplementary piece, which had to be taken into account for theoretical or methodological reasons. An important component of this attitude was also the fact that regulators were and still are convinced – not on the basis of their formal powers, but the real practice – that they have power, which is accompanied by the knowledge, experience and tools at their disposal to be almost certain that they act reasonably and in the interest of the society. Economic realities have changed dramatically and in the conditions of high uncertainty and complexity, in all areas of operation of financial institutions, there is a definite shift towards uncertainty and high-risk management. As a result of these processes, the role of regulators gets weaker, and they do not have either sufficient knowledge or necessary resources, or any special desire as an administrative institution, to create regulations that would be adequate to the existing and future changes of the market. From the perspective of risk management, the position of regulators becomes anachronistic. For these reasons, the introduction of the methodology of regulatory risk management becomes an urgent necessity. The principle of proportionality, as one of the key principles of European lawmaking, has been known for a long time, but in practice, the stipulations of the EU directives and regulations rarely used it. The rule one size fits all has been absolutely dominant for decades. Both European and American regulators are beginning to increasingly raise the aspect of proportionality [Letter, 2017]. Although a quantitative- qualitative model of respecting the principle of proportionality has been developed, the scope of its application in practice is still very low. Its essence boils down to the requirement that the expected regulatory objectives are not achieved by increasing excessive weights (loads) imposed on the regulated entities. What is important, the principle of proportionality does not differentiate the regulations depending only on the scale of operation of the banks (small versus large), but it extends the principle by taking into account the differentiation of effects in relation to the three basic categories: benefits, costs, and risks. What is more, it is postulated to take into account the effects of regulations in sectoral, international, global terms or even in a breakdown of the key stakeholders. There is a belief that too large diversity of the effects of the regulation is the first step to seek easier solutions, to seek escape in regulatory arbitrage, and results in degradation of legislation. Moreover, widely promoted regulatory programmes appeared: Better Regulation, Regulatory Sandbox or the solutions adopted in the concepts of the Banking Union and Capital Markets Union. The importance of the regulation is influenced also by institutional changes in the system of supervision at the global, international, and national level. There are also numerous, permanent or occasional, rankings concerning the evaluation of the quality of the implemented regulations (e.g. Doing Business, World Government Indicators, Index of Economic Freedom). The evolution of regulating of the banking sector was quite slow; initially, until the end of 1960s, a trend of regulations focusing on pursuing public objectives was dominant. From this period, a clearer approval for the trend aiming at achieving private objectives, using the so-called micro-prudential regulations, followed. The last financial crisis brought about significant changes in the approach to regulating financial institutions, which is the subject of further considerations of this article. Post-crisis regulations The causes of the outbreak of the subprime financial crisis and drastic costs, that were necessary for its limitation, became a major challenge for the search for effective mechanisms and instruments, to avoid the situation from the years 2007/2008. B. Young [2014] provides that in the years 2007-2009, the governments of the EU member states, to rescue banks, raised expenditure at the level of 22% of the Gross National Product (GDP). In the publication of J. Armour, et al., [2014], the Authors report that the costs of the crisis of 2007-2009 are estimated at the level of 1.5 billion dollars, which is 20% of the annual world production, where the losses of the United Kingdom in this period were at the level of 140 billion pounds. The discussion on the sources of crisis somewhat weakened, but it is not finished. The list of factors is enormous, but what is important is that the negligence in the sphere of regulations of the financial markets (negative impact of the deregulation process) and the blatant weaknesses in the management system of the systematically relevant institutions are commonly indicated. Moreover, at the level of individual banks, risk management was also an important factor generating the financial crisis, due to the excessive trust of the management boards in the results of the advanced risk models, application of aggressive motivational systems, occurrence of the low level of responsibility of the employees at all levels of management and the use of low lending standards, especially mortgage, and in the observance of ethical principles [Kasiewicz, 2015]. The infamous role of the credit rating agencies and some consulting firms and the extensive use of securitisation and OTC derivatives cannot be omitted as well [Belka, 2013]. The causes of the crisis are also seen in the factors arising from the structural, income inequalities, and in behavioural activities (e.g. herd behaviour of investors, opportunistic attitudes of the national supervisors). In connection with the total criticism of the causes of the financial crisis, repairing the system of regulation of the banking market occurred in unprecedented dynamics and size. It soon became clear that the wave of regulations is so large that the scale of this phenomenon began to be called a regulatory tsunami, regulatory heat, or regulatory shock. It is almost unbelievable how huge legislative effort has been made after the outbreak of the financial crisis in the mid-2007 in the European Union. For over five post-crisis years, there were 56 regulations developed and discussed in the European Parliament or the European Commission, 37 of which were implemented [Merler, Veron, 2014]. This phenomenon does not seem to be definitely limited. Three factors will be decisive: first, the large number of existing regulations, which will result in that the deletion of their weaknesses will require corrections or developing new legislation. Second, there is no indication that the wave of innovation could expire in the next few years, some of them will be destructive, which will lead to the beginning of the works on new legal acts. Third, there will be an administrative pressure to meet the current needs, different than expected earlier. On the one hand, for the stakeholders, those are not texts that read easily, and it is even harder to interpret and evaluate their social, economic, ecological results, to achieve consensus, implement and monitor. On the other hand, there is the cascade of problems that almost every regulation implies, and this makes that there are always regulations that require changes and updates. What is more, very often, new regulations do not remove the already existing and obsolete ones, so they must be followed by adaptation to the current conditions and to a larger number of accumulated legislation. The vision of future EU regulatory projects for the years 2015-2019 has been formulated by S. Merler, N. Veron [2014]: 1) continuation of the legislative actions associated with the repair of the financial system after the crisis; 2) aiming at creation of a single financial market; 3) insufficient development of the European financial services provided by non-banking institutions and the capital market (shadow banking); 4) new institutional architecture of the European Union; 5) loss of leadership in defining of standards.This vision of the Authors opts for modification and finalizing regulatory issues, which have already been taken up in the previous years, but no sufficient, intended effects have been reached, which requires taking extensive and supporting legislative actions. There is no doubt that after the last financial crisis the banks are over-regulated, and what is important – the number of regulations does not decrease, but rather increases. Suffice to mention the last or announced regulations, such as: SEPA, AIFMD, FATCA, automatic exchange of information, PRIIPs, MiFID II, UCITS, etc. [Szpringer, Szpringer, 2014] or the EU data protection legal framework, to become aware of the high pressure under which the bank managements are, in order to keep pace with the constantly changing regulatory or market environment, stability and achieving the expected level of profitability. A matter of urgency is cooperation and coordination of activities, not only to identify the areas of possible conflicts, duplicated areas of regulations, and to find the time for the diagnosis of the newly emerging threats. The evaluation of the results of over-regulations of the banking sector has not been sufficiently analysed yet, and is not a subject of great interest of the scientific and research circles [Blinder, 2014]. It is still worth pointing out that one of the most important arguments for the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU has been the criticised system of community law making. On the occasion of this debate, the data that shed light on the problem of over-regulation have been presented. It turns out that 2,500 reports on the evaluation of the effects of regulations since 1998 to 2013 in terms of generating costs have been examined [Top 100, 2017]. According to this study, 100 most expensive regulations cost the United Kingdom 27.4 billion pounds per year; moreover, a quarter exceeds the estimated benefits. It has been calculated that the annual net costs for the UK amount to 3 billion pounds. The results of the study of the United Kingdom illustrate a strong influence of the EU legislature on the member states. It is estimated that this impact is in a relatively wide range of 13 to 62%. [BGLN, 2016]. It seems that for the member states that joined the EU after 2004, the level of this influence is closer to this maximum size, as the scope of the changes in the legal system was much wider. What is more, it is impossible to conclude from this publication whether the scope of the research covered only the regulations of the financial sector, because if not, the influence of the EU law in the financial industry would be much higher than 62%, as most of the regulations were addressed to the financial institutions and the financial market. To sum up these considerations, it can be stated that after the financial crisis, the approach to regulating banks changed radically. Not only the role of the trend of domination of public objectives in the system of their regulation has been restored, but also the need to apply macroeconomic instruments has been understood. The micro-prudential regulation has been enriched with new mechanisms, principles, methodologies, and institutions. The substantive scope of regulating the banking sector has been definitely expanded, and what is more – embedded within the entire financial sector. The question arises whether this trend will be maintained, or whether the banking services market will force the necessity to search for new trends and concepts of regulating banks. The next point of the article will present the projected vision of the development of banks in the next decade and the concepts of their regulation. Future market of banking services The future trends of the banking sector are predicted in many publications, which take the form of permanent or occasional reports. In this area, valuable are the reports of the consulting firms such as: Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte, McKinsey, or Capegimini. It is also worth mentioning about the publications connected with the World Economic Forum, the operation of EBA, or financial portals (e.g. of Chris Skinner). To simplify the discussion about a possible banking model in the perspective of 2020 or 2030, we will limit ourselves to some of its selected dimensions: centres of banking services, competition and the issues of risk management. Centres of banking services The role of financial centres is underestimated in the source literature, maybe because so far they were stable. It is hard to deny that the financial centres influence the competing system of the banks, set standards of consumer service, affect the directions and priorities of regulating the activities of commercial banks. If new centres of financial services were created or a change in the structure of existing ones took place, it could cause turmoil on the market of financial institutions, in the system of competing of the banks, and in regulations. In these areas, the largest European and American banks play a decisive role. In the publication BGLN [2016], a position is formulated that assuming a growing integration of European banks and capital markets, and with the United Kingdom leaving the EU, the centre of banking services will gradually move from London to Paris or Frankfurt. It is not expected that a “champion” will emerge on the European market. Furthermore, it is foreseen that the European banks will experience the effect of adverse factors affecting their future development. J-B. Gosse and D. Philon [2014] form a more general vision of financial centres. They see the positive impact of development of Islamic finances in the Middle East, the possibility of creating new financial centres in developing countries, and the possibility to create an important financial centre in Hong Kong on the Asian market. null Competition and tools of competition Many reports indicate that in the near future, banking will function and compete in the digital space [Kony, 2015, WEF, 2017]. A consulting firm Deloitte [2016] finds that by 2030 customers will contact banking institutions only virtually. This will change all elements of management: strategies, business models, organizational structures, customer communication systems, product distribution and environment. It is clearly proven by the identified ten trends in retail banking [Kony, 2015]: 1) Use of digital platforms in the provision of banking services (Platformification of banking) The provision of banking services on a common platform means that to a lesser extent the banks will compete directly with the new service institutions (e.g. fintechs, startups), but more efficiently operate in a partnership relation. It is mostly because of the advantage of the banks over these institutions (Figure 1) and of the potential benefits resulting from cooperation (Figure 2). The three most important competitive advantages of the banks include: hav- Figure 2 Benefits of cooperation of banks with startups Source: Kony, December 2015, p. 15. – feature meaning a small advantage of bank more innovative solutions 69% 28% 2% – feature meaning a significant advantage of banks – feature meaning a moderate advantage of banks faster introduction of innovations on the market 57% 41% 2% lower costs of innovative activities 40% 58% 2% more significant influence on the effects (revenues, costs and profitability) 39% 56% 5% ing customer databases, confidence in banks, and experience in relations with regulators. In contrast, the weaknesses of startups are expressed in: the lack of experience in cooperation with regulators, small number of offered products, and limited experience in the scope of risk management. What is important for the tools of competition between the banks and startups are the potential benefits that can be achieved by banks, and most of all: achieving innovative solutions, faster, therefore less costly entrance on the innovation market, lowering of the costs of the implemented innovations, and achieving important business effects of the highly regarded shareholders. 2) Elimination of disputes in customer service The market of services will be won by the banks that can offer products making daily lives of their customer easier. The customers appreciate these banking services that provide such features as: speed, intuitiveness, and comfort during their provision [Kony, 2015]. Traditional bank branches loose in the areas where the services are delivered to customers via the Internet or mobile applications. 3) Use of Big Data It turns out that a great opportunity for the achievement of competitive advantage is obtaining information from social networking websites. They allow for a better understanding of customers at all stages of their contacts with the bank. This leads to a reduction of the costs of customer services, achieving higher revenues from sales, and an increase of customer loyalty. 4) Use of multi-channel provision of services (optichannel) Banks appreciate actions that lead to optimisation of channels of service distribution, both traditional and new. The customers are not limited to only one distribution channel (see Figure 3). What is puzzling, though, is the fact that now up to 84% of the customers still visit a bank branch at least once a month. 5) Development of digital payments Despite the introduction of many new technologies (cloud, Big Data, mobile applications) in the payment system, it is claimed that the progress in digitisation will be moderate, because the share of cash transactions will still be significant – about 25%. Great expectations are connected with dissemination of transactions using the mobile wallet. According to the Authors of the report, customers require the payments to meet at least three key conditions: ease and comfort of use, individualisation, and access unlimited in time (24/7) [Kony, 2015]. 6) Implementation of innovations The possibility of non-financial institutions to enter the market of banking services on a wider scale (technological companies, startups, new banking organisations) makes the banks concentrate on pursuing innovative strategies. According to this report, the number of banks that realise innovative strategies increased almost twice in the years 2009-2015, from 37 to 73%. [Kony, 2015]. What is important, the increase of investments is made in the following areas: channels of distribution, customer service, and the use of their knowledge and experience, processes, products, sales, and marketing. 7) Application of advanced technologies The number of advanced technologies that can be used directly by the banking sector or have a significant influence on its operation is enormous. Surprisingly, it is foreseen that a “turning point” for their application will be before 2025. The technologies that will mostly influence this process include: robots, Internet of things, block-chain, 3D printing, remotely- controlled car. 8) Occurrence of new formulae of providing services Technological possibilities will make the entrepreneurial managers to create new banking institutions from the start, e.g. in the United Kingdom, the already created Atom Bank, Monzo Bank, and Tandem. null null 9) Searching for new talents A consequence of the development of implementation of advanced technologies is the necessity to search for new human resources, especially the so-called new talents, and than to use their potential effectively and to the maximum. null 10) Responding to regulatory changes The result of the study, according to which the presidents of banks find that the regulatory factor is often treated as the most important among determinants of the destruction of the banking sector, is not surprising [Kony, 2015]. It is much more important than competition, customers, or channels of distribution. It is also worth emphasising that over-regulation of the sector is leading among the factors affecting its growth. null The WEF report [2017] presents the future of retail banking in a similar tone. According to its Authors, the development of retail banking will be shaped by the three most important levers: • the empowered consumer, • disruptive technologies (Internet of things, self-driving cars/drones, artificial intelligence/machine learning, robots, digital traceability technologies, 3D printing, augmented/virtual reality, blockchain), • transforming business models, and they include: a model of new generation of cooperation, model of individualization, demand model and service model. The WEF report of 2017 pays a lot of attention to the social aspects revealed in the development of retail banking. It is foreseen, in particular, that in the next decade the role of shopping centres and central streets as places of social integration will change. The number of retail facilities will be drastically reduced (Figure 4). This trend will be followed by the reduction in the number of people employed in the retail trade (Figure 5). The reduction of employees will relate mainly to the group of cashiers and administrative staff (back office employees). As a result of automation, their workplaces in the perspective of a decade may be at risk at the level of 30 to 50%. Also, the structure of employees in branch offices and in banks will change. Risk management The future trends in risk management in the banking sector are presented in the publication of the known consulting firm, McKinsey [Härle, et al., 2015]. The perversity of this article is that first, general trends of bank management in the perspective of the next 10 years are presented, and than, the areas and issues specific to risk management are identified. The publication describes six structural trends that will transform the bank management process, that is they will affect the changes of: priorities, scope, approach, methods, and reporting in the area of risk management. They are: 1) Continuation of the over-regulation process. Apparently, it may seem that after the wave of implementation of a lot of crisis regulations in the financial sector, the regulatory pendulum will drastically change to reduce the activity of regulators and supervisors. According to the Authors of this publication, it is not going to happen. They justify it with numerous arguments, in particular, the lack of acceptance of the current model of covering the costs of bankruptcy (insolvency) of banks by taxpayers, the need of efficient response to illegal or unethical conduct of banks,","['trends', 'system', 'regulating', 'market', 'bank', 'services']"
"Governing Image-Based Sexual Abuse: Digital Platform Policies, Tools, and Practices",2021,"Abstract The nonconsensual taking or sharing of nude or sexual images, also known as ""image-based sexual abuse,"" is a major social and legal problem in the digital age. In this chapter, we examine the problem of image-based sexual abuse in the context of digital platform governance. Specifically, we focus on two key governance issues: first, the governance of platforms, including the regulatory frameworks that apply to technology companies; and second, the governance by platforms, focusing on their policies, tools, and practices for responding to image-based sexual abuse. After analyzing the policies and practices of a range of digital platforms, we identify four overarching shortcomings: (1) inconsistent, reductionist, and ambiguous language; (2) a stark gap between the policy and practice of content regulation, including transparency deficits; (3) imperfect technology for detecting abuse; and (4) the responsibilization of users to report and prevent abuse. Drawing on a model of corporate social responsibility (CSR), we argue that until platforms better address these problems, they risk failing victim-survivors of image-based sexual abuse and are implicated in the perpetration of such abuse. We conclude by calling for reasonable and proportionate state-based regulation that can help to better align governance by platforms with CSR-initiatives.

Introduction The nonconsensual taking or sharing of nude or sexual images, also known as ""image-based sexual abuse"" (Henry et al., 2020; McGlynn & Rackley, 2017) or ""nonconsensual pornography"" (Citron & Franks, 2014; Ruvalcaba & Eaton, 2020), is a major social and legal problem in the digital age. With the development of social media and other networked technologies, which enable over three billion users to generate and instantaneously share content on the internet (Kemp, 2020), image-based sexual abuse is not only rapidly increasingly, but also having significant impacts (Henry et al., 2020). While criminal offenses are an important means to punish perpetrators and provide justice to victim-survivors, criminalization has done little to prevent the scourge of image-based sexual abuse or minimize the harm once images (photographs or videos) are posted online. For example, images can be copied and republished on multiple platforms and devices – in some cases making it virtually impossible to prevent the further spread of images online. Perpetrators are often difficult to identify because of anonymity measures, such as encryption, virtual private networks, and proxy servers that obscure the nature of content, locations of internet traffic, and other information about users and their devices. Moreover, policing for image-based sexual abuse (and cybercrime more generally) is typically resource intensive given that law enforcement agencies often have to work across jurisdictional borders. In response to the complex challenges raised by harmful online content, governments around the world are introducing new regulatory regimes to attempt to better hold technology companies accountable for hosting harmful content on their platforms. At the same time, technology companies are themselves taking more proactive steps to tackle this problem. In this chapter, we examine the problem of image-based sexual abuse in light of these two forms of governance. In the first section, we focus on the governance of digital platforms, examining the introduction of broader governmental and intergovernmental regulatory regimes in a changing landscape, which some have described as a global ""techlash"" against the major digital platforms (Flew, Martin, & Suzor, 2019, p. 33). In the second section, we examine the governance by digital platforms, focusing specifically on the policies, tools, and practices that are being implemented by digital platforms to respond to and prevent image-based sexual abuse. In the third section, we draw on a model of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to propose ways forward. CSR provides a useful, albeit contested, language to examine the policy and practice of online content moderation or regulation. Although there are different conceptions of CSR, we define it as corporations' social, economic, legal, moral, and ethical responsibilities to address the harmful effects of their activities. Our conception of CSR is embedded within a social justice framework that locates the rationale for action not solely as a profit- or reputation-building exercise, but one that is also contingent on community values and the ""common good."" We argue that while many digital platforms are taking proactive steps to detect and address image-based sexual abuse, four main shortcomings are evident in their policy approaches. First, some platforms adopt inconsistent, reductionist, and ambiguous language to describe image-based sexual abuse. Second, although a number of platforms now have an explicit policy position on image-based sexual abuse, there is often a stark gap between the policy and practice of content regulation, as well as a lack of transparency about how decisions are made and what the outcomes of those decisions are. Third, while platforms are increasingly turning to high-tech solutions to either detect or prevent image-based sexual abuse, these are imperfect measures that can be circumvented. And fourth, the onus is predominantly placed on users to find and report image-based sexual abuse to the platforms, which can be retraumatizing and highly stressful. We contend that because of their governing power, public character, and control of information, digital platforms have an ethical responsibility to detect, address, and prevent image-based sexual abuse on their networks. This is despite the degree of legal immunity that platforms have against harmful content posted by their users under section 230(c) of the United States (US) Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA 230). We argue that when platforms govern without sufficient regulatory safeguards in place, such as appeal processes and reason-giving practices (Suzor, 2019), they risk failing victim-survivors of image-based sexual abuse and are implicated in the perpetration of image-based sexual abuse. Governance of Digital Platforms Also known as ""internet intermediaries,"" or ""online service providers,"" digital platforms are nonstate, corporate organizations or entities that facilitate transactions, information exchange, or communications between third parties on the internet (see, e.g., Taddeo & Floridi, 2016). According to Gillespie (2018), digital platforms are ""sites and services that host public expression, store it on and serve it up from the cloud, organize access to it through search and recommendation, or install it onto mobile devices"" (p. 254). Gillespie (2018) explains that what digital platforms share in common is the hosting and organization of ""user content for public circulation, without having produced or commissioned it"" (p. 254). While digital platforms might appear to be neutral conduits or proxies for the exchange of online content between third parties, they are never neutral, and have been described as the ""new governors"" or ""superpowers"" of the digital age (Klonick, 2018; Lee, 2018). Some commentators argue that technology companies are engaged in illicit forms of digital surveillance, plundering the behavioral data of users to sell to business customers (including political advertisers) for economic profit (e.g., Zuboff, 2019), as well as creating the norms and means through which individual users can engage in ""performative surveillance"" in the form of tracking, monitoring, and observing other users online (e.g., Westlake, 2008). In addition to potentially illicit forms of surveillance and data harvesting, one of the key ways platforms govern their networks is by moderating user-generated content. As a form of regulation, content moderation encompasses an array of processes through which platform executives and their employees set, maintain, and enforce the bounds of ""appropriate"" user behaviors (Witt, Suzor, & Huggins, 2019). The norm is for content moderation to be ex post, meaning it is undertaken after a user has posted content, and reactive in response to user flags or reports (Klonick, 2018; Roberts, 2019). This means that platforms generally do not proactively screen content, decisions about which are thus predominantly made after the material is posted. On some platforms, however, automated systems are increasingly playing a more central role in the detection and removal of harmful online content before anyone has the chance to view or share the material (see further discussion below). There are significant transparency deficits around the ways that different types of content are moderated in practice (Witt et al., 2019, p. 558). It is often unclear, for instance, what material is signaled for removal, how much content is actually removed, and by what means. It is also impossible to determine precisely who removes content (e.g., a platform content moderator or a user) without access to a platform's internal workings (Witt et al., 2019, p. 572). The secrecy around the inner workings of content moderation is reinforced by the operation of contract law, which governs the platform–user relationship, and powerful legal protections under US law (where many platforms are primarily based). Specifically, CDA 230 protects platforms against liability for content posted by third parties. Consequently, platforms that host or republish content are generally not legally liable for what their users say or do except for illegal content or content that infringes intellectual property regimes. Indeed, technology companies not only exercise ""unprecedented power"" over ""what [users] can see or share"" (Suzor, 2019, p. 8), but also have ""broad discretion to create and enforce their rules in almost any way they see fit"" (Suzor, 2019, p. 106). This means that decisions around content can be based on a range of factors, including public-facing policies like terms of service, community guidelines, prescriptive guidelines that moderators follow behind closed doors, legal obligations, market forces, and cultural norms of use. Digital platforms are not, however, completely ""lawless"" (Suzor, 2019, p. 107). Platforms are subject to a range of laws in jurisdictions around the globe, some of which have the potential to threaten the ongoing stability of the CDA 230 safe harbor provisions. Europe has been described as the ""world's leading tech watchdog"" (Satariano, 2018) especially with European regulators taking an ""increasingly activist stance toward… digital platform companies"" (Flew et al., 2019, p. 34). The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Germany's NetzDG laws, for instance, can result in significant administrative fines for data protection or security infringements (among other punitive consequences for noncompliance) (see Echikson & Knodt, 2018; The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2016/679). There are also many examples of European courts ordering service providers to restrict the types of content users see and how and when they see it (e.g., copyright or defamation lawsuits) (Suzor, 2019, p. 49). These state-based ""regulatory pushbacks"" are part of a global ""techlash"" against the governing powers of digital platforms in recent years (Flew et al., 2019, pp. 33 and 34). At the time of writing this chapter, the United Kingdom had proposed a range of measures in its White Paper on Online Harms, which includes a statutory duty of care that will legally require platforms to stop and prevent harmful material appearing on their networks (Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, 2019). In 2019, Canada released the Digital Charter in Action, which includes 10 key principles designed to ensure the ethical collection, use, and disclosure of data (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, 2019). Going a step further, after the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand on March 15, 2019, the Australian Federal Government passed the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Act 2019 (Cth) which gives the Australian eSafety Commissioner powers to issue take-down notices to digital platforms that host abhorrent violent material (AVM). If a service provider fails to remove AVM, they can be subject to prosecution under Australian federal criminal law, among other potential courses of action. Moreover, in 2018, the Australian federal government introduced an innovative civil penalty scheme which prohibits the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, as well as threatening to share intimate images. Under this scheme, the eSafety Commissioner can issue substantial fines, formal warnings, infringement notices, or take-down notices to individuals and corporations requiring the removal of images within 48 hours. These domestic and international developments recognize that the decision-making processes of ostensibly ""private"" digital platforms can have significant impacts on individual users and far-reaching implications for politics, culture, and society (the ""public sphere"") more broadly. They also suggest that platform immunity from legal liability for both privacy violations and the hosting of harmful content is diminishing – at least in some jurisdictional contexts. Digital platforms might then not be completely lawless, but do in practice govern, to use Suzor's (2019) term, ""in a lawless way"" (p. 107). Platforms exercise extraordinary power with limited safeguards for users, such as fairness, equality, and certainty, which many Western citizens have come to expect from governing actors (Witt et al., 2019). The result is often a significant gap between platform policies and their governance in practice, as well as a lack of transparency around digital platforms' decision-making processes. Governance by Digital Platforms In this section, we explore an array of policies, tools, and practices that are designed to detect, prevent, and respond to image-based sexual abuse on some of the largest digital platforms. Given the rapid pace of innovation in the technology sector, we selected platforms according to their traffic, market dominance, and their capacity to host image-based sexual abuse content. The sites we selected were predominantly the most popular sites as ranked by the analytics company Alexa (Alexa Internet, n.d.). The social media and search engine platforms we examined included Google, YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo!, Reddit, Instagram, Microsoft, Twitter, Flickr, Snapchat, TikTok, and Tumblr. The pornography sites we examined included Pornhub, XVideos, and xHamster. After creating a list of sites, we used the Google search engine to identify each company's policy documents, including their terms of service, community guidelines, reports, and official blogs. Each document was analyzed to identify specific image-based sexual abuse policies, general policies that could be applicable to image-based sexual abuse, and tools for either detecting, reporting, or blocking content, if any. We also searched for any relevant news articles or blogs on platforms' responses to image-based sexual abuse content. Our approach has four main limitations. The first limitation is that we were only able to examine publicly available policy documents. As such, we were not able to examine the undisclosed guidelines that moderators follow behind closed doors or information about the privatized automated systems that digital platforms might use. Second, we carried out our analysis over a three-month period between January and March 2020 and thus we cannot account for any changes in policies, tools, or practices after this time. Third, we did not examine non-English technology companies, nor did we examine the fringe, ""rogue,"" or underground platforms (e.g., on the Clear Net or Dark Net) where image-based sexual abuse content is being shared and traded (see Henry & Flynn, 2019). Finally, we did not seek to empirically investigate the experiences or perspectives of either victim-survivors or platform representatives in relation to content removal or platform policies, tools, and practices. Currently there is a pervasive lack of transparency around platform governance and more research is needed to address this gap. The analysis below, however, provides insight into how select platforms are attempting to address and prevent image-based sexual abuse. Here we focus on three key areas of content moderation: platform policies; reporting options and practices; and technological tools. Platform Policies on Image-Based Sexual Abuse The term ""revenge porn"" came into popular usage in 2011 after widespread media attention to the nonconsensual sharing of nude or sexual images of musicians and sportspersons on the website IsAnyoneUp.com and the subsequent criminal trial of its founder Hunter Moore (Martens, 2011). The term, however, is a misnomer because not all perpetrators are motivated by revenge when they share nude or sexual images without consent. Instead they may be motivated for other reasons, such as sexual gratification, monetary gain, social status building, or a desire for power and control (Citron & Franks, 2014; Henry et al., 2020). The term ""revenge porn"" has been widely criticized as having victim-blaming, harm-minimizing, or salacious connotations. Scholars, activists, victim-survivors, and practitioners also argue that it fails to capture the complexity and diversity of behaviors involving the use and abuse of nonconsensual nude or sexual images by known and unknown persons alike, using diverse means and methods (Henry et al., 2020; McGlynn & Rackley, 2017; Powell, Henry, & Flynn, 2018). Although a small number of digital platforms continue to refer to ""revenge porn"" in their terms of service or community guidelines, others have adopted alternative terms, such as ""nonconsensual pornography,"" ""involuntary pornography,"" or ""the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images."" Tumblr's community guidelines, for instance, state: ""Absolutely do not post nonconsensual pornography – that is, private photos or videos taken or posted without the subject's consent"" (Tumblr, 2020, Privacy violations, para 1). Other platforms outline prohibitions against broader forms of online content. For instance, Pornhub's terms of service explicitly prohibit, among other behaviors, the impersonation of another person, the posting of copyrighted material, content that depicts a person under the age of 18, and content that is ""obscene, illegal, unlawful, defamatory, libellous, harassing, hateful, racially, or ethnically offensive"" (Pornhub, 2020, Monitoring and enforcement, para 4). Notably, however, Pornhub does not specify explicit prohibitions against image-based sexual abuse. In their policies, xHamster and XVideos do not specifically mention image-based sexual abuse but instead refer to privacy, abuse, harassment, inappropriate, or illegal content (xHamster, 2020; XVideos, n.d.). TikTok's Community Policy similarly does not mention image-based sexual abuse content and instead tells users that this is ""NOT the place to post, share, or promote… harmful or dangerous content"" (TikTok, 2019; para 4). On some platforms, the prohibition of image-based sexual abuse is unclear. For instance, Snapchat states that users should not ""take Snaps of people in private spaces – like a bathroom, locker room or a medical facility – without their knowledge and consent"" (Snap Inc., 2019, para 4). Although examples are given of what a ""private space"" might entail, it is unclear whether the nonconsensual sharing of nude or sexual imagery is also prohibited in the context of ""public"" spaces. Facebook's policy on the sharing of image-based sexual abuse content, on the other hand, is much clearer, allowing the sharing of images to be either ""noncommercial"" or ""private"" with an expansive definition of what an ""intimate"" image includes. Facebook prohibits the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images according to three criteria: the image is noncommercial or produced in a private setting; the person is nude, nearly nude, or engaged in a sexual act or posing in a sexual way; and there is lack of consent indicated by captions, comments, the title of the page, independent sources, or reports from victims or others (Facebook, 2020a). However, the focus on images that are noncommercial, and which are produced in a private setting, appears to deny sex workers or pornographic actors the right to control the dissemination of their images. There can be significant flow-on effects of ambiguous policy stances on image-based sexual abuse. Platform policies that are open-textured, or which use nondescript terms, can enable ad hoc decision-making in response to business and other pressures (Witt et al., 2019). The lack of consistent language for platforms to name and work through the problems of image-based sexual abuse can make it difficult for stakeholders to discuss the concerns that victim-survivors and other societal actors raise. Moreover, vague guidelines can fundamentally limit the ability of victim-survivors or their authorized representatives to apply platform policies to reporting features or inform users as to the bounds of acceptable behavior. Given that platforms almost always reserve ""broad discretion"" to determine what, if any, response will be given to a report of harmful content (Suzor, 2019, p. 106), it is essentially their choice whether or not to impose punitive (or other) measures on users when their terms of service or community guidelines have been violated (some of which have appeals processes in place). While platforms are not able to make arrests or issue warrants, they are able to remove content, limit access to their sites to offending users, issue warnings, disable accounts for specified periods of time, or permanently suspend accounts at their discretion. YouTube, for instance, has implemented a ""strikes system"" which first entails the removal of content and a warning issued (sent by email) to let the user know the Community Guidelines have been violated with no penalty to the user's channel if it is a first offense (YouTube, 2020, What happens if, para 1). After a first offense, users will be issued a strike against their channel, and once they have received three strikes, their channel will be terminated. Other platforms have similar systems in place. As noted by York and Zuckerman (2019), the suspension of user accounts can act as a ""strong disincentive"" to post harmful content where social or professional reputation is at stake (p. 144). Deepfakes The extent to which platform policies and guidelines explicitly or implicitly cover ""deepfakes,"" including deepfake pornography, is a relatively new governance issue. Deepfakes are a portmanteau of ""deep learning,"" a subfield of narrow artificial intelligence (AI) used to create content and fake images. In December 2017, a Reddit user, who called himself ""deepfakes,"" trained algorithms to swap the faces of actors in pornography videos with the faces of well-known celebrities (see Chesney & Citron, 2019; Franks & Waldman, 2019). Since then, the volume of deepfake videos on the internet has increased exponentially; the vast majority of which are pornographic and disproportionately target women (Ajder, Patrini, Cavalli, & Cullen, 2019). In early 2020, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube announced new or altered policies prohibiting deepfake content. In order for deepfake content to be removed on Facebook, for instance, it must meet two criteria: first, it must have been ""edited or synthesized… in ways that aren't apparent to an average person and would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say""; and second, it must be the product of AI or machine learning (Facebook, 2020a, Manipulated media, para 3). The narrow scope of these criteria, which appears to be targeting manipulated fake news rather than different types of manipulated media, makes it unclear whether videos with no sound will be covered by the policy – for instance, a person's face that is superimposed onto another person's body in a silent porn video. Moreover, this policy may not cover low-tech, non-AI techniques that are used to alter videos and photographs – also known as ""shallowfakes"" (see Bose, 2020). On the other hand, Twitter's new deepfake policy refers to ""synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm"" according to three key criteria: first, if the content is synthetic or manipulated; second, if the content was shared in a deceptive manner; and third, if the content is likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm (Twitter, 2020, para 1). The posting of deepfake imagery on Twitter can lead to a number of consequences depending on whether any or all of the three criteria are satisfied. These include applying a label to the content to make it clear that the content is fake; reducing the visibility of the content or preventing it from being recommended; providing a link to additional explanations or clarifications; removing the content; or suspending accounts where there have been repeated or severe violations of the policy (Twitter, 2020). While specific deepfake policies do not exist on other platforms, some have more general rules relating to ""fake/d,"" ""false,"" ""misleading,"" ""digitally manipulated,"" ""lookalike,"" and/or ""aggregate"" content, which could result in the take-down of deepfake images. Pornhub (2020) does not mention deepfakes in its Terms of Service; however, in 2018 it did announce a ban on deepfakes (Cole, 2018). Nevertheless, the site continues to host deepfake pornography. When we searched for ""deepfakes"" using the internal Pornhub search function, no results were found, yet when we searched through Google ""deepfakes"" and ""pornhub,"" multiple results of fake celebrity videos were returned. Reporting Harmful Content Reporting options are another means through which digital platforms can address the problem of image-based sexual abuse. All of the platforms we examined have in place some sort of reporting protocol, including the porn sites, which are supposed to trigger review by human content moderators. On porn sites, for instance, users can report through either a Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 take-down request, or via a content removal form. Facebook recently announced that image-based sexual abuse content is now triaged alongside self-harm in the content moderation queue (Solon, 2019). Another important form of content reporting occurs through the ""flagging"" system where users are enlisted as a ""volunteer corps of regulators"" to alert platforms about content that violates their policies and community standards (Crawford & Gillespie, 2016, p. 412). Facebook users, for instance, flag around one million pieces of content per day (Buni & Chemaly, 2016). Many companies provide built-in reporting features through which users can report material that potentially violates content policies (Witt et al., 2019, p. 577). For instance, Pornhub allows users to flag videos (using the ""Flag this video"" link under each video) if it is ""illegal, unlawful, harassing, harmful, offensive, or various other reasons,"" stating that it will remove the content from the site without delay (Pornhub, 2020, Prohibited uses, para 2). Platform reporting systems predominantly place the onus on victim-survivors or other users to flag or report image-based sexual abuse content. In other words, digital platforms ""[responsibilize users] to reduce their own risk of [victimization]"" (Salter, Crofts, & Lee, 2018, p. 301). Major online platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, suggest that users take a range of preventive measures, such as unfollowing or blocking those responsible for posting abusive content, reviewing their safety and security settings, and accessing hyperlinked information. Microsoft, for instance, suggests that users should identify the source and/or owner of an image and attempt to have it removed before reporting it as a potential policy violation (Microsoft, 2020). If unsuccessful, victims are encouraged to report content through built-in or other reporting features. Preconditions like this, in many ways, are a ""practical solut","['governing', 'image-based', 'sexual', 'abuse:', 'digital', 'platform', 'policies,', 'tools,', 'practices']"

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Workforce Development and the Effectiveness of Decision-Making in the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship in Jordan,2024,"The study aimed to explore the impact of artificial intelligence, with its dimensions (neural networks, algorithms, and intelligent agents), on workforce development (employee skills and abilities, training, and incentives) and the effectiveness of decision-making (problem identification, best alternative selection) at the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship in Jordan. The descriptive-analytical approach was used, with a questionnaire as the primary tool for data collection. The study's population consisted of all employees at the Ministry, totaling 356 individuals. Using the comprehensive survey method (targeted sampling), all employees were included as the study sample, and 335 valid questionnaires were retrieved for statistical analysis. The study applied means, standard deviations, and multiple regression analysis, with statistical treatments conducted using SPSS software. The findings revealed that artificial intelligence, in its various dimensions, significantly impacted workforce development and decision-making effectiveness at the Ministry. The study recommended maintaining the application of neural networks in solving organizational management problems to aid in process monitoring, and adopting algorithms in production plans to reduce material consumption, thus helping employees accomplish their tasks more efficiently.

Artificial Intelligence for stress management at workplace: A NewPerspective,2021,"Stress, poses a huge problem in today’s era when our lives have paced up and we are hooked up all the time. It can lead to a spectrum of health problems. Computer aided artificial intelligence systems for diagnosis of stress would enable a more objective and consistent diagnosis and decisions. Several parameters like Body temperature, Blood Pressure, muscle tension and stiffness, and heart rate are clear indicators and can be used by sensors to collect data about an individual and predict his stress levels. This stress creates pernicious effects particularly for employees and business owners. When workers hear artificial intelligence, robotizing the workplace doesn’t lend any relaxation, rather creates a sense of insecurity of losing job. Ironically, AI tools may do the opposite, making the workplace more human and keeping work stress at bay. In today’s workplace, AI tools are gaining traction. Chatbots and messaging interfaces for tasks like customer support, and client follow-up, can effectively cut out the unnecessary workload and reduce the burden. Automated repetitive tasks that employees do daily leave no room for them to relax. Rather, it drains out the energy and leads to stress. AI can automate for them thus enabling the employees to harness their intellect and skill set for building emotional intelligence, and social interactions which AI can never automate. AI enabled wearable devices, can analyse, and monitor behaviour and emotions. This can identify employees battling with stress. AI-led workplace stress management can play a significant role in diagnosis and cure of stress This will be key to workplace stress management, as you strive towards building a happy, productive, and future-ready workforce.","['artificial', 'intelligence', 'stress', 'management', 'workplace:', 'newperspective']"
The role of organizational design and culture in the value‐based healthcare movement: The case of the Cleveland Clinic,2023,"The Cleveland Clinic was founded in 1921 as a multi-specialty group practice staffed and run by four physicians who had served in a military hospital in France during World War I. The four men—Drs. Crile, Lower, Bunts, and Philips—were inspired by a vision of a healthcare system in which physicians ""acted as a unit,"" collaborating in ways that departed radically from the back-then norm of fiercely independent and competitive physicians and practices. In so doing, the Cleveland Clinic challenged the status quo of physicians as ""heroic lone healers.""1 Over the next 101 years, the collaborative vision that gave rise to the Clinic evolved into a nonprofit healthcare system made up of 22 hospitals and 275 outpatient facilities around the globe, including Cleveland Clinic hospitals in Abu Dhabi and London. The Main Campus in Cleveland today has some 1300 hospital beds where patients are treated by over 3000 physicians supported by 40,000 other caregivers, including 11,000 nurses. In aggregate, the Clinic now employs over 77,000 caregivers worldwide—a group that includes more than 5500 physicians and scientists, 3500 advanced practice providers, 2000 trainees, and 15,000 nurses. In 2022, this group of 77,000 treated 3.4 million patients with distinction.2 The Cleveland Clinic has consistently been ranked as a top hospital in US News and World Report rankings, with many top-ranked specialties. For example, the Clinic has been ranked #1 in the category of Cardiology and Heart & Vascular Surgery in all 29 years the rankings have been undertaken. The stellar rankings and performance of the Clinic have also received national recognition, perhaps most memorably during President Obama's much-publicized trip to Cleveland in 2012, when the Clinic's practices and accomplishments were held up as a model for American healthcare. The Clinic's reputation owes importantly to its ongoing commitment to continuous improvement in carrying out its three-part mission of ""caring for life, researching for health, and educating those who serve."" One such improvement was a fundamental and innovative transformation of the Clinic's organizational structure, or ""org chart,"" in 2008. Until 2008, the Clinic was organized, like most hospitals (and colleges and their medical schools), into separate ""departments"" corresponding to their special areas of expertise—departments of Surgery, Internal Medicine, Neurology, and so forth. This departmental organization is a traditional structure that reflects the guild-like nature of medical training, and the bond of common experience shared by physicians working in the same specialties. Departments (or divisions) are further broken down into medical subspecialties such as Cardiology, Nephrology, Rheumatology, and Gastroenterology, and the surgical specialties of Cardiovascular Surgery, Urology, Orthopedics, and other disease-oriented surgical disciplines. This traditional structure of guild-based departments was completely revamped in 2008 under the direction of the Clinic's then-CEO and President, Dr. Toby Cosgrove. After joining the Clinic in 1975 and becoming chairman of its Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery in 1989, Cosgrove was appointed CEO in 2004 (a position he held until his retirement in 2017). Early in 2008—and just weeks before one of the present writers joined the Clinic as head of its Cardiac Electrophysiology section—all the departments were reorganized and replaced by 22 new ""Institutes"" dedicated to serving the Clinic's three-part mission of patient care, medical research, and continuing education of caregivers. Patients don't experience their illness or conditions in terms of academic departments or divisions. Patients who have complex conditions such as diabetes or a brain tumor often require the expertise of many different specialists. Traditionally, that has required them to move among various departments to get care…and has meant that some of the doctors involved in their care weren't communicating with other doctors as fully as possible, leading to duplicate tests. Also, because some departments are more profitable than others, patients often have to contend with understaffing and underfunding in the less profitable departments (such as psychology) relative to the more profitable ones (such as heart surgery).3 fundamentally changed the organizational relationships among thousands of physicians. Many of them arrived at work one morning to find that they had new supervisors and coworkers in an organization unit that hadn't existed the day before. Even so, few staff members offered objections. They clearly understood the potential that institutes had to enhance patient care. Having everyone on the same team allowed the organization to envisage institutes, plan them, communicate the change, implement the change, and fine-tune the concept, all without consulting interests or cozening internal lobbies. Reinforcing such resistance to change were ""powerful forces,"" including ""the inertia and the temptation to continue doing things the way they've always been done."" ""After all,"" as Cosgrove stated, ""the Clinic was already one of the most successful hospitals in the world, so if it wasn't broke, why fix it?"" In the pages that follow, we attempt to explain why this embrace of the Institute model in 2008—which Cosgrove said in his 2014 book that the Cleveland Clinic ""has pushed further than any organization""—should be viewed as a critical new phase in the Clinic's continuous development toward becoming the increasingly ""patient-focused"" value-based healthcare institution that its four founders envisioned in 1921. As further testimony to its ongoing commitment to ensuring that its structure supports its tri-partite mission as fully as possible, the Clinic is currently in the midst of yet another revision of the Institute model. (The goal of this new operating model, which we discuss in more detail later, is to strengthen the Clinic's ability not only to provide the globally uniform patient outcomes and experience for which it has achieved international renown, but to extend those assurances to all its ""caregivers""—nurses and trainees as well as physicians and scientists4—and their local communities throughout the Clinic's many global sites of care. The perennial goal is to be the best place to receive care and the best place to work in health care anywhere. This new operating model, still being implemented at this writing, is organized around current CEO Dr. Tom Mihaljevic's commitment to meeting the requirements of what the Clinic now identifies as its four ""cares"": (1) patients, (2) caregivers, (3) the community, and (4) the organization. As Cosgrove also acknowledges in his book, this vision of value-based care, and the ""Institute model"" designed and put in place to carry it out, was being advocated by the likes of Harvard Business School's strategy guru, Michael Porter. With Cosgrove's and the Clinic's possible debt to Porter in mind (though the influence was likely reciprocal and mutually reinforcing), our explanation begins with a brief review of the six major tenets of Porter's concept of value-based healthcare delivery and shows how each has informed the practices of the Clinic. In so doing, we draw on the standard doctrine that an organization's structure should be designed to deliver on its mission and strategy. Finally, the case of the Clinic is used to show how an organization's ""culture""—as reflected in its shared values and norms—depends upon and is reinforced by its structure while contributing to its success and staying power. In Porter's concept, value-based healthcare—the quest for the best possible patient outcomes delivered by a system with the lowest possible cost—has six main elements.5 First and most important is the reorganizing of traditional (or ""legacy"") hospital and healthcare systems away from separate competitive departments based on physician specialties and into integrated practice units (or IPUs) centered on patients' medical conditions. Such a reorganization was accomplished in the Clinic's decision in 2008 to replace all its existing departments with new Institutes. As noted above, the rationale for such change begins with the recognition that cardiologists and cardiac surgeons ought to work more collaboratively since they treat the same diseases and often share the same patients. The Clinic's Institute model was intended to reduce potential barriers to collaboration resulting from physicians working within different Departments. This transition to Institutes makes it possible and helps facilitate the second key element of Porter's framework, which is to compile detailed information about patient outcomes (in all stages of treatment) and all the associated costs. Expanded record-keeping and measurement in turn provide a much more reliable basis for the third element: the replacement of fee-for-services by ""bundled"" pricing. As Porter notes, the practice of ""capitation""—which might be described as the first generation of bundled pricing—has been around and increasing for decades; but without IPUs and the information made possible by them, capitation pricing itself is not likely to be accurate or effective in allocating resources across the system. Such reorganization and monitoring of outcomes and costs are also consistent with, and supported by, two other elements: increased specialization by hospital systems in their areas of expertise and comparative advantage; and expansion of the systems' geographic reach. The increasing size, specialization, and geographic spread of hospital systems like the Clinic are all seen by Porter as working together to achieve what he calls the ""virtuous cycle of volumes"" in which growing expertise ends up improving outcomes and reducing overall cost. Another reason bigger is likely to be better for some healthcare systems concerns the role of size in increasing the accuracy of assessments of the costs (and financial risks) of providing bundled services. Smaller referring hospitals may have less experience with (and therefore less confidence when) assessing the specific financial risks associated with complex conditions with multiple co-morbidities, prolonged hospitalizations, and readmissions than the larger institutions to which such patients are referred. In general, Porter notes that their greater precision in predicting variables such as the number of days in intensive care, risk of readmission, and long-term outcomes in cases involving such ""high-risk"" patients will advantage healthcare systems. Any redesign of our hospitals and healthcare system must try to harmonize the interests of all its major stakeholders. Patients need to be taken care of, as do hospitals, healthcare providers, and third-party payers. Accurate modeling of outcomes and costs is needed to achieve this goal.6 Less clear, however, is the role of public disclosure in value-based healthcare, at least in its present early stages.7 One less widely expressed concern about our healthcare system is the natural tendency of physicians whose outcomes are being tracked to refer more high-risk patients to other centers to burnish their own track records. The fact that published outcomes may not be risk-adjusted goes a long way in explaining the paradox that many of our leading medical centers do not report the best outcomes and costs. Simply put, crude measures (those making no attempt to adjust for risk) of outcomes may be worse because the patients they care for are sicker. So, while there are clearly good reasons for hospitals and individual physicians to put information about their outcomes and costs in the public domain, this practice has a clear potential downside—unwarranted transfers of high-risk patients from one center to another mainly to pad the hospitals or its individual physicians' published outcome statistics. The net effect of all this is to distort and undermine the informative value of the statistics themselves.8 If the limits of this kind of information are not readily apparent to most patients and ""retail"" consumers of healthcare, such limits are very well understood by hospital administrators and the health insurers that provide much of the financial backing for the U.S. healthcare system. It is largely because of the uncertainty and the associated potential for distortion that surrounds this risk adjustment process that bundled care focuses mainly on the standard care for a typical patient. The models used to estimate bundled costs for high-risk patients are still evolving. In the meantime, hospitals like the Clinic with a disproportionate number of such patients face the challenge of bundling the cost of care while being adequately compensated.9 To be sure, national payers like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) do risk-adjust payments for Medicare Advantage plans based on the patient's demographics and health status in the medical records. But this is just a first step toward what Porter envisions as a more cost-effective U.S. healthcare system. The sixth and final element of Porter's model is to build an integrated information technology (IT) platform that helps healthcare systems to better measure outcomes and, where necessary, rethink and restructure the delivery of care. This will be difficult to achieve without standard data definitions and elements that include medical notes, images, and laboratory reports from the electronic medical record (EMR).10 The overall architecture should not only serve as a medical record, but also be designed to yield measures of outcomes, process, and costs for each patient and medical condition. These are all moving targets that have been made possible by continuous progress and improvements in treatments and reductions in costs. Moreover, such a technology platform must be designed to facilitate communication and provide accurate comparisons of outcomes and costs between organizations. Hospitals are working toward these goals, but there is a long way to go and change will require a very large investment of capital—both human and financial. Advanced computing systems and artificial intelligence hold out the promise for managing massive amounts of data in real time. As one example, the Cleveland Clinic has recently entered into collaboration with IBM to use quantum computing and artificial intelligence for clinical research on treating medical disorders such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.11 These kinds of sophisticated IT systems are likely to prove useful in predicting risk-adjusted outcomes and costs more accurately and efficiently, which, in turn, should provide the basis for identifying the most cost-effective care pathways. In the context of the Clinic's mission and its strategy for achieving it—both formulated in keeping with Porter's vision of value-based healthcare—we now show how the Clinic's organization has been designed to complement and reinforce that mission and strategy. Drawing on the concept of ""organizational architecture"" (featured in the article immediately preceding this one),12 this discussion will focus mainly on two important aspects of large organizations: (1) who gets to make what decisions (as determined by how the lines of reporting are drawn across and throughout the organization), and (2) how performance at all levels of the organization is evaluated and rewarded. To start with, the Cleveland Clinic has always been and remains a physician-led organization dedicated to its three-part mission of clinical care, research, and education—one that is formally stated as ""caring for life, researching for health, and educating those who serve."" The Clinic's vision, or what might today be called its ""corporate purpose,"" is to be the undisputed ""best place to receive care anywhere."" Its ""patients first"" mantra captures and drives that mission. The Clinic's CEO is—and has long been required by its bylaws to be—a physician who also serves as President of the Board of Directors.13 The role and responsibilities of the Board are to oversee and ensure the execution of the mission, including fiduciary oversight. To this end, the Board approves budgets for both ongoing operations and other strategic projects and initiatives that, in 2022, produced a total operating revenue of roughly $13 billion.14 The Clinic's Organizational Chart. From 2008 until quite recently, the Cleveland Clinic had been organized into 22 clinical Institutes that include Departments of related medical specialties. This structure was introduced to encourage physicians within each of these departments and centers to collaborate with a singular focus on patient-centered care. Consider, for example, the Clinic's globally renowned Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute, which consists of Departments of Cardiology, Cardiac Surgery, Vascular Surgery, and Thoracic Surgery. Existing alongside and cutting across the boundaries of these four Departments are the Institute's 46 specialty centers for diseases staffed by physicians from different departments within the Institute. Examples include centers for adult congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart rhythm disorders, and cancers involving the chest. The purpose of such centers is to foster multidisciplinary collaboration that works to overcome barriers between the disciplines. The Clinic's Annual Professional and Performance Review (APR) Process. Reporting directly to the CEO is another physician designated the Chief of Staff, who is charged with overseeing the entire medical staff, including matters of ongoing performance assessment. Ultimately, it is the Chief of Staff's responsibility to help set and oversee standards and address concerns about professional skills, performance, and behavior. Since its inception, the Clinic has been distinguished by its physician leadership (working in close collaboration with administrative leaders), 1-year appointments for all faculty (called ""Staff""), and a salaried model that deliberately avoids the use of formula-based salary incentives. Among its other effects, this system is designed to ensure that clinical decisions about treating specific patients, ordering tests, or recommending procedures or surgical operations are made based on optimal clinical care and without any consideration of the financial impact on the institution or the physician's remuneration. In carrying out this goal, the Clinic has also been distinguished by the persistence and intensity of its emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, both between and within ""specialties."" Most physicians are not directly involved in the business side of the practice, which helps ensure that their primary consideration is the well-being of their patients. The Annual Professional Review or APR, is a process of near legendary thoroughness in which each Staff physician annually engages in discussion with her or his respective leaders about professional and personal goals, and the alignment of these goals with institutional priorities, for the forthcoming year. The conversations are informed by data that describe the Staff physician's clinical work, quality, research, and educational activities as applicable. Specific data elements are used for evaluating most or all of the following aspects of a given physician's performance: clinical quality of care and productivity; scholarship and academic activity (including grants and papers); educational roles and performance (including teaching assessments from learners like graduate trainees and medical students); leadership in professional organizations; service to the community; contributions to administration or committee assignments at the Cleveland Clinic; and finally, collegiality and professional behavior. The APR requires face-to-face meetings for each physician with the Department and Institute Chairs, as well as a meeting with a member of the Medical Executive Committee (MEC), which is comprised of physicians elected by the physician staff. The MEC member interviews with the Staff under review are designed to increase the Clinic's understanding of and appreciation for each Staff member's experience of the Institute, the Clinic, and the Institute Chair. What's more, the Chair of each of the Clinic's Institutes presents her/his APR to the Clinic's CEO and MEC. During such presentations (which summarize each Institute's contributions to the Clinic's mission), questions are directed to the Chairs, after which the MEC member who interviewed all Institute Staff reports to the MEC the major themes emerging from the individual Staff interviews (with all identities erased). The Chair's performance, as reflected in the APR presentation, determines whether his or her leadership role is renewed. The APR is very time-intensive; at a time when the Clinic Staff was roughly a third of its current size (then about 1,700), a total of 7100 person-hours were allocated to the APR process annually.15 The size of this time commitment bespeaks the perceived value of the APR process, to the Clinic's leadership and its Staff alike. The APR process is widely viewed as ""the fabric"" that binds the culture of the Clinic's group practice. Using Information Technology to Evaluate Patient Outcomes. From its start, the Cleveland Clinic has also distinguished itself as a data-driven organization that has dedicated substantial resources to tracking measures of quality outcomes. These metrics from each Institute have been published annually and are publicly available online. Among the metrics of greatest general interest are clinical volumes, ""raw"" (as opposed to risk-adjusted) outcomes and complication rates, and long-term follow-up as available. Few healthcare organizations have matched the Clinic's commitment to understanding the effectiveness of its treatments and to making this information available to its stakeholders and the general public. The ultimate purpose of such record-keeping is to provide a highly developed information system that serves as a catalyst for quality improvement. The underlying premise is that physicians who see their results will be both better informed and motivated to improve. Annual reports also serve to inform patients and their referring physicians about the Cleveland Clinic's outcomes for specific conditions. Such information also guides physicians' efforts to collaborate more effectively in ways that benefit patients, and healthcare practice and performance generally—for example, by developing clinical care pathways that improve outcomes, reduce readmission rates, and otherwise work to contain costs. Until the recent changes in the Clinic's org chart, the integrity of the quality data registries and quality improvement program was maintained and overseen by a separate and independent group, the Clinic's Quality and Patient Safety Institute. Research at the Cleveland Clinic. At the Clinic, medical innovation is viewed as ""ideas that have been put to work.""16 In 2022, the Clinic received $154 million in awards from the National Institutes of Health, and over $400 million of total outside research funding for basic science, translational science, and clinical investigations. The Clinic invests over $420 million in research and education annually and has more than 3600 active research projects. Though not all physicians are engaged in research, nearly all work collaboratively with clinical investigators and physician-scientists. All Institutes are well represented by both clinical investigators and translational and basic scientists. The results of these investigations are published extensively in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, and many Clinic physicians present their work in national and international forums that foster innovation and continuing medical education. The Cleveland Clinic's Education Programs. The Clinic's Education Institute has always been central to its overall mission. The Institute currently consists of 11 ""centers."" Along with one dedicated to graduate medical education and another to continuing medical education, the Institute also includes the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine as well as centers for Simulation and Advanced Skills, Health Professions Education, and International Medical Education. This structure works to integrate education with the rest of the Clinic's activities in a way designed to accomplish the Education Institute's three main goals: preparing future caregivers; ensuring the continuity of the Clinic's talent pipeline; and maintaining, harmonizing, and ""systematizing"" its education standards and practices across all global sites. As a measure of its extensive and global impact, in 2023 alone the Education Institute recorded over four million ""education encounters"" around the world. Working together with the Clinic's Mandel Leadership and Learning Institute, the Education Institute also helps develop physician leaders to deal with the challenges of healthcare. Spurred by its recognition that healthcare leadership competencies are different from clinical and scientific ones, the Clinic's deep commitment to developing healthcare leadership began more than two decades ago with a course called Leading in Health Care.17 The course invited joint participation by physicians, nurses, and administrators all learning together. During a series of ten full-day sessions distributed over a 10-month period, interdisciplinary teams were invited to generate ideas, and then formal proposals, for implementing specific innovations at the Clinic. The concrete deliverable at the end of the course was a fully vetted business plan for the proposed innovation that was presented to the Clinic's leadership at the final session. As one indicator of the success and value of this leadership course, it has served as an effective innovation incubator. After the first offering of the course, over 60% of the proposed business plans resulted in one of two constructive outcomes—either the plan was actually implemented, or ""a bad idea"" was quickly dispatched. In its 10-year follow-up reviews, the Clinic has found that over 40% of the course's physician participants have in fact been promoted to leadership positions at the Clinic.18 Also worth noting, before the onset of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, the Clinic also offered one-to-two-week immersive leadership development training programs to outside visitors in the Executive Visitors Program and the Samson Global Leadership Academy (SGLA). During its decade of offerings, the SGLA welcomed over 188 executives from 26 countries.19 In the post-pandemic era, the Samson Global Leadership Academy is now being offered in international settings like the 2024 Arab Health Meeting. In keeping with the priority of patient experience at the Clinic, communication and empathetic care are seen as key parts of its educational offerings. For example, in 2011 a new program was implemented to improve the patient experience. All 43,000 then members of the Clinic's Main Campus were taken offline on weekdays to attend a session called Communicate with HEART (Hear, Empathize, Apologize, Respond, Thank). The goal was to enhance caring for patients and fellow caregivers in ways intended to make them feel ""as if they are family."" As another demonstration of its concern about the patient experience, the Clinic gives great attention to the look and feel of its building and spaces, with artwork, vistas, and open spaces designed to promote healing. Patients' voices are encouraged through frequent feedback invitations, surveys, and patient focus groups.20 And to help patients and visitors navigate their way around its large campus, the Clinic engages people it calls Redcoats as ""greeters"" to provide directions and otherwise orient patients, finding wheelchairs when needed, and otherwise facilitate visits. While physicians are understandably focused on treating illness, the Clinic has long recognized the ways that ""healthcare"" goes beyond just ""sick care."" The Wellness and Preventive Medicine Institute was established to provide outpatient services that educate people about healthy choices to reduce the risk of disease. At the same time, the Clinic has also recognized that, to lead by example, disease prevention should include efforts to encourage model behavior by Clinic caregivers. Smoking is banned on the campus; and under Dr. Cosgrove's leadership, the Clinic implemented the testing of prospective employees for active smoking (with urine nicotine testing) and offered free smoking cessation programs. Not smoking is a condition of employment. And there has been a significant financial payoff from the Clinic's investment in its caregivers' health and well-being. For every dollar spent on tobacco prevention, the Clinic estimates it has realized $4 in healthcare savings, reducing its health insurance costs by $36 million just by not hiring smokers. Similarly, financial incentives such as reduced health insurance premiums are offered to caregivers to encourage employees to exercise and lose weight (including free access to Weight Watchers and gym memberships). Sugary drinks and trans fats have been removed from cafeterias and vending machines. The net effect of these and other wellness-promoting measures has been that the Clinic's employee healthcare costs were reduced by an estimated $15 million between 2010 and 2013. As much as the Clinic aims to provide a supportive working environment for its employees, it is not surprising that work in healthcare in general, and perhaps especially at busy institutions like the Clinic that care disproportionately for complex patients, can be intense and stressful, predisposing caregivers to the epidemic of ""burnout"" in healthcare. Clinic leadership is highly mindful of this risk and various strategies have been implemented to mitigate stress. Among them are greater provisions for the use of new","['role', 'organizational', 'design', 'culture', 'value‐based', 'healthcare', 'movement:', 'case', 'cleveland', 'clinic']"

Challenges and opportunities to making Indian women cervical cancer free,2023,"Cervical cancer (CaCx) is the fourth most predominant cancer among women the world over with an estimated 604,127 new cases and about 341,831 deaths reported in 20201. Reportedly, one woman dies due to CaCx every 3 min globally. Despite CaCx is fully preventable and curable if detected early, in India, it is still a major public health problem and ranks second in women and the leading cause of deaths (77,348) annually2,3. The infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) is established to be the prime causative agent for CaCx, the prevalence of which has been found to be the highest in India2,3. Therefore, the role of regular screening, early detection and treatment are most essential in reducing morbidity, mortality and burden of cervical cancer. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the global elimination of CaCx by 2030, by implementing three coordinated interventive actions; (i) 90 per cent HPV vaccination, (ii) 70 per cent high-performance cervical screening and (iii) 90 per cent early effective treatment for those already infected and have diseases1. However, eradication of CaCx in low- and middle -income countries (LMICs), particularly in India and southeast Asia, is highly challenging, hence inordinately delayed. The question arises whether LMICs, in particular India, will at all be able to achieve this goal even with the availability of an affordable new single-dose HPV vaccine, (CERVAVAC®, Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd., Pune). India with a population of more than 1.4 billion along with a relatively low socioeconomic status, inadequate health infrastructure, lack of trained workforce, limited budget, absence of universal screening, lack of awareness, vaccine hesitancy, social/religious stigma and no effective curative care when compared to those available in developed countries. Numerous epidemiological, experimental, molecular, pathological and clinical studies2 have established that infection of HPV, a DNA tumour virus, is the principal aetiologic human carcinogen that causes CaCx in women. For this discovery, a Nobel Prize was awarded in 2008 to Harald zurHausen from the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany (https://www.dkfz.de/en/zurhausen/). Of all cancers, it is the first cancer among women which has the effective vaccines to prevent it, early detection methods to screen pre-cancer lesions and access to early treatment as it takes 10-20 years to develop an invasive cancer. An estimated 341,831 deaths were recorded around the globe in 2020 while ~91 per cent (312,373) of CaCx-related deaths were recorded in LMICs compared to only 8.6 per cent in high-income countries (HICs)4. This is mainly due to inadequate control/prevention and treatment facilities5. There are neither many attempts till date to introduce the HPV vaccine in its National Immunization Programme (NIP) nor any initiative for a universal screening programme in India despite the high annual incidence of CaCx and high associated mortalities. It indicates that CaCx is primarily a disease of poor women from LMICs which have no affordable HPV immunization, organized national screening programmes and adequate treatment and follow up facilities are in place. In India, not only almost 100 per cent of CaCx but also 90 per cent of anal, 20-70 per cent head-and-neck and 9-35 per cent oesophageal cancers are also associated with high-risk (HR) oncogenic HPV infection, specifically type 166. HPV vaccination is challenging and delayed in India Although till date more than 100 countries have introduced the HPV vaccines in their NIP, India and all of South Asian countries which needed this vaccine, most have not been able to introduce it. In fact, in 2009, a 'demonstration pilot project' on HPV vaccine the immunogenicity testing was launched in India by the Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) in the States of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, but the trial was suspended due to the death of a few adolescent school girls after HPV vaccination3. The deaths were, however, later proved to be unrelated to HPV vaccination. However, it is still not cleared of litigation, and the controversy still exists about the safety as well as the efficacy of HPV vaccines in the public mind leading to negligible coverage (~1%) of HPV vaccination in India. Current HPV vaccines are all preventive and not therapeutic At present, there are three major Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HPV preventive vaccines: (i) Gardasil (a tetravalent against HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18), (ii) Cervarix (a bivalent against HR-HPV types 16 and 18) and (iii) Gardasil-9 (a nonavalent against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) are available since 20087. Besides these, there are three more vaccines: Cecolin and Walvax are for girls aged 9-14 yr as a two-dose schedule while CERVAVAC® is for both girls and boys aged 9-14 yr for a single-dose or two-dose schedule for six months apart. These vaccines reportedly provide ≥90 per cent protection against major oncogenic HPV types. Although these vaccines are based on recombinant DNA technology using VLPs (virus-like particles), which have been found to be highly immunogenic, 100 per cent safe, reportedly develop herd immunity and produce high antibody titre if given to adolescent girls aged between 9 -19 yr7. However, the benefit of eliminating the pre-existing infections is not possible as these vaccines have no therapeutic efficacy, so it is not effective if one has already been infected with HPV. Therefore, women vaccinated before their sexual debut or prior to HPV infection will receive the highest protection against the virus infection. HPV vaccination strategies in developed countries: A path to eradicating cervical cancer Since serious challenges to HPV immunization exist in India, the success stories of HPV vaccination from developed nations can serve as a roadmap for developing countries. Notably, European countries, the United States and Australia have achieved the highest immunization and screening rates, particularly for adolescent girls but also including boys2,8-10. Developed nations exhibit a tangible impact, with 88 per cent of these introducing HPV immunization programmes, more than 30 per cent of adolescents receiving the vaccine and over 60 per cent of women undergoing cervical cancer screening11. Their success in reducing incidence and mortality of CaCx can be attributed to comprehensive HPV vaccination strategies, school-based initiatives, expanded age groups, technological advancements, public education and awareness with robust monitoring. A remarkable example from the European nations is Belgium's Flanders region, achieving a 91 per cent vaccination coverage. Their awareness programmes on available vaccines for healthcare professionals, parents and school-based vaccination programme with digital vaccine approaches were highly successful12. Recently survey in Sweden also suggested a 93 per cent coverage rate, showing positive attitude and importance of health information among healthcare workers13. Australia's National HPV Immunization Programme stands out, with vaccine coverage rates exceeding 89 per cent for girls and 86 per cent for boys at the age of 15 yr for the single dose in 20179,14. The high coverage of HPV vaccination in developed countries indicates that they may soon be able to achieve successful elimination of cervical cancer. India develops a cost-effective single-dose HPV vaccine, CERVAVAC®: Opportunity for elimination of cervical cancer Recently, a new cheaper (₹ 200-400 equivalent to US$ 2.5-5) HPV vaccine, 'CERVAVAC®', is approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and is being introduced in India as a single dose for girls aged between 9 and 19 yr15. However, despite having this opportunity, it is still doubtful to achieve the goal of complete elimination of HPV and CaCx by 2030 or later in India as there are a huge number of issues including ethical, moral, societal, religious, vaccine acceptance, myths, misinformation, lack of awareness, lack of an organized screening programme, adequate trained manpower, and access to effective treatment. It will be successful only if an active initiative is taken by the Government of India to introduce this vaccine as a mandatory vaccine through NIP for adolescents taking cues of our success story of polio, smallpox and COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, the vaccine may also be made free for all girls and boys. A working model for universal elimination of cervical cancer (i) Smart HPV-Immunization and Awareness Programme: 'Smart HPV-immunization and screening programme' for rapid scale-up of HPV vaccination in India using the COVID-19 vaccination model should be developed. There is need for a strong awareness programme for teachers, students, parents, adolescents, policymakers, social workers and political leaders including gynaecologist, paediatrician and public health professionals and the public at large. The use of print and electronic media, mobile health and artificial intelligence for success of such an immunization programme is recommended. (ii) School/college/university-based vaccination programmes: A compulsory school- and college-based HPV immunization programme for 9-19 yr adolescents is required to scale up HPV vaccination for both boys and girls. Help from parents and teachers for successfully implementing such a programme is recommended. (iii)Difficult-to-reach populations: Targeting adolescents at the worksite for difficult-to-reach teenagers not attending school or college will allow for a better coverage. (iv) Only one dose schedule: Since single-dose HPV vaccine is equally effective and gives long-term protection comparable to three doses, it will help in preventing and reducing CaCx burden. The low-cost single-dose Indian-made new HPV vaccine, CERVAVAC®, is effective and a game changer for India as it is capable of increasing acceptability, feasibility and affordability. (v) Door-to-door or camp-based mass vaccination programme: Such a drive will lead to success of mass vaccination of HPV and be useful to catch-up hard-to-reach adolescents. (vi) Gender-neutral HPV vaccination: A step towards inclusive public health comprises inclusion of both adolescent girls and boys in India's immunization programme, a promising strategy to combat CaCx and HPV-related diseases in a full-proof manner because males are the host of HPV. HPV testing offers reliable cervical cancer screening Since HPV cannot be cultured in vitro, HPV diagnostics rely mainly on nucleic acid technologies that detect HPV DNA/RNA in cervical samples. Several molecular techniques are available for the detection of HPV infection and are proven to be highly sensitive and specific than conventional Pap test (Papanicolaou) and VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid). Before the introduction of CERVAVAC® or any available HPV vaccines in India, it is important to know the prevalence of HR-HPV types in different geographic regions (high in Chennai and low in Kashmir) and among communities such as significant high prevalence in tribal population16 whereas low prevalence in Muslim population5,6. Investigations are also needed to discover additional HPV types, subtypes/variants or new HPV types circulating in Indian population. It is intriguing that no new HPV genotype has been described yet despite global HPV prevalence being highest in India. Alternative approaches for prevention or elimination of HPV infection Currently, no therapeutic vaccine or drug is available for the treatment of HPV, but several alternative anti-HPV preventive/ therapeutic formulations/drugs are available, which have been clinically validated to show clearance of HPV infection or stop viral replication at early pre-cancer (CIN1-CIN2) stages when HPV is not integrated into the host cell genome. Several products, for example, Wartec17, cidofovir18, hexaminolevulinate19, curcumin20,21, berberine22 and sulindac23, have strong anti-HPV effects and either clear (80-90%) or inhibit progression/viral replication or oncogene expression when used as topical intravaginal applications (4 wk ± menstrual days)24. The polyherbal creams, such as Praneem (Panacea biotec, New Delhi) and Basant (Bipha Bioscience, Kerala), can reportedly clear ≥90 per cent HPV infection in women with pre-cancerous lesions in phase II randomized controlled trials25,26. These derivatives are commonly used for elimination of HPV infection at an early stage, but there is inadequate evidence to introduce these in general clinical practice. Challenges in India The WHO's proposed triple interventional approaches appear to be feasible in HICs for global elimination of HPV, but it is challenging in LMICs including India. In LMICs and India, national HPV immunization and cytology-based screening programmes such as Pap test or even VIA have not yet been implemented at national level, in spite of the fact that ≥85 per cent of mortalities occur due to cervical and other HPV-related cancers in India3. There are several factors such as inadequate infrastructure, trained human resource, low budget; vaccine safety, supply and hesitancy, religious/social beliefs/culture, myths, poor vaccine acceptance, illiteracy and lack of knowledge and awareness are responsible for low coverage of HPV vaccination. Therefore, HPV vaccination and screening essential for reducing/eliminating CaCx are of enormous challenge. It requires coordinated efforts of all stakeholders, specifically the government, NGOs, the public healthcare system and the population at large including awareness through social, electronic and print media including mobile health and other available methods. In addition, training of gynaecologists, paediatricians, cytopathologists, public health and social workers in primary health centres, community health centre and Mohalla (community) clinics, ESIC (Employees' State Insurance Corporation) hospitals and regional cancer centres with clear, realistic and focussed goals is crucial for successful elimination of HPV and CaCx in India and LMICs by 2047, if not by 2030. Future perspectives (i) Gender-neutral HPV vaccination for both boys and girls is most essential for the drastic reduction or complete elimination of HPV infection/transmission of HPV-related diseases. Males are also affected by HPV for tongue/oropharyngeal, oesophageal and head-and-neck, penile, anal, mouth, larynx and tonsil cancers27,28, and most importantly, males serve as reservoirs/hosts of HPV which is sexually transmitted to females. Almost ~91 per cent of men and 85 per cent of women who have had a sexual relationship will have HPV infection at any time in their lifetime and more than 50 per cent of men remain as carrier29. It has been also shown that men are more vulnerable to HPV infection as they have low immune response against HPV than women30. Therefore, the universal HPV vaccination programme can offer the greatest protection against the virus for both men and women contributing towards the effective elimination of HPV. Further, the risk of HPV transmission in gay and bisexual men is high and they are reportedly 17 times more likely to develop anogenital cancer than heterosexual males (https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD.htm). (ii) Non-invasive point-of-care method with self-sampling for quick test of HPV will improve easy screening and testing of HPV using urine or saliva samples which have been well correlated with gold standard biopsy31-33. (iii) The development of oral vaccination and its inclusion in childhood immunization (within five years of age) would be desirable instead of the present intramuscular injectable vaccine. This will be an easy approach for effective vaccination which will be highly acceptable the world over. (iv) Development of DNA/mRNA universal HPV vaccine for all HR-HPV types to prevent their infection and associated cancer. This is now essential because, as reported, there is development of cervical lesions in already vaccinated women by non-vaccine HPV types9. It is a natural phenomenon that when some pathogenic viruses/bacteria are controlled, often the other related microbes/viruses get activated to cause similar diseases. To sum up, cervical cancer continues to be a major public health problem affecting middle-aged women, particularly in India and other LMICs where the highest burden of all infection-associated cancers is often linked with low economic status and lack of knowledge and awareness among medical/public health professionals and the public at large. The recent landmark discovery of a cost-effective and single-dose indigenous HPV vaccine, CERVAVAC®, should be accepted and implemented without further delay for an effective prevention and control of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases in India which need it the most.

Human rights in the era of digital economy development: prospects and challenges.,2023,"With the emergence and rapid development of the digital economy, new challenges to the protection of human rights arise. Digital technologies, artificial intelligence, big data, and other innovations offer many opportunities for the development of society, but they also threaten fundamental human rights and freedoms. One of the biggest challenges is the collection and processing of personal data. In the digital economy, large amounts of personally identifiable information are stored and used by companies and governments. Organisations and governments are making efforts to improve cybersecurity by developing and implementing strong security measures, including data encryption, multi-level authentication, and monitoring of cyberattacks. It is important to provide adequate cybersecurity training and education for both employees and citizens. This will help raise awareness of cyber threats and teach people how to protect their personal information. Artificial intelligence (AI) can lead to the automation of decision-making processes, which can affect people's rights and freedoms. For example, AI systems may be involved in decision-making processes regarding employment, credit scoring, or even offences. However, it is important to ensure that the algorithms are fair, transparent, and take into account the rights and needs of people.

"Time in range in patients with type 2 diabetes who are <scp>long‐term</scp> users of <scp>d‐Nav</scp>®, an artificial <scp>intelligence‐driven</scp> technology for autonomous titration of insulin dosing",2023,"Use of artificial intelligence (AI) to titrate insulin therapy frequently has become the mainstay of modern insulin management in diabetes mellitus. There are currently two technology-driven approaches. First, contemporary insulin-pumps combined with continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have been furnished with software packages that autonomously titrate the insulin infusion rate every few minutes, in systems called automated insulin delivery (AID). These systems have been used mainly for patients with type 1 diabetes1-3 but has also been tested in patients with type 2 diabetes.4 Second, for patients who use insulin injections mainly for type 2 diabetes, the d-Nav® technology enables autonomous insulin titration at least weekly.5, 6 It has been suggested that time in range (TIR) for glucose concentrations obtained from CGM devices provides complementary information beyond average glycaemia or levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c).7 We have previously reported long-term HbA1c levels in patients who use d-Nav®. Within 6-9 months, the average HbA1c in d-Nav® users reaches a steady state and remains at about 7% for as long as patients use the technology.6 In this service evaluation, we report TIR and other standard CGM-acquired parameters in long-term d-Nav® users with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we compare our findings with published results from AID systems. Descriptions and validations of the d-Nav® technology as a standard of care for hypoglycaemia prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes7 can be found elsewhere, including data on long-term adherence.5, 6 Briefly, patients referred to the d-Nav® Service are provided with a phone application ('app') called d-Nav®. Patients use their own glucometer or CGM to measure glucose concentrations before each insulin injection, and d-Nav® provides a dose recommendation for that injection. The AI within d-Nav® assesses each patient's responses to his or her current insulin doses by analysing glucose patterns and titrates doses at least weekly. The AI autonomously adjusts each patient's insulin doses to reach a clinically achievable balance between preventing hyperglycaemia and preventing hypoglycaemia. If insulin requirements drop or hypoglycaemia ensues, the AI within d-Nav® makes immediate autonomous adjustments as often as needed, following the safety-first approach of prioritizing the avoidance of hypoglycaemia. Trained health care providers (specifically, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, medical assistants) are trained to become d-Nav® specialists. They follow-up with patients through telephone calls or in-person meetings at least monthly, to boost user confidence and correct usage errors. Information about the specific roles of frequent d-Nav® autonomous insulin titrations and health care providers support on glycaemia can be found elsewhere.5 Providers who uses the d-Nav® Service for their patients can review the d-Nav® data for each patient at any given time, allowing them to handle all other medications for diabetes and any comorbid conditions. We obtained de-identified data that had been generated from d-Nav® users within the United States between January 2019 and May 2023. These data were acquired retrospectively and were limited to secondary use of non-identifiable information previously collected during normal clinical care. Thus, the study was exempt from institutional review board approval. We included patients with type 2 diabetes who have been using d-Nav® >6 months (and thus have reached glycaemic stability), used CGMs, and provided access to their CGM information for ongoing care. Access to patients' CGM information relied on their willingness and ability to share the information. The primary outcome of this service evaluation was the average TIR based on the most recent 14 days of CGM data. The secondary outcome was the correlation between average glucose concentrations and TIR. To assess dynamics over time, we also examined TIR during a 14-day period 6 months before the most recently available data. Data were compared with standard goals for CGM metrics from the most recent guidelines for glycaemic targets from the American Diabetes Association.7 Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables were displayed as means ± SD. Categorical variables are given as n (%). To allow the attainment of glycaemic stability,6 our analyses omitted glucose and insulin data from the first 6 months on d-Nav®. To assess the correlation between average glucose concentrations and TIR, we calculated a Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). We acquired CGM information from 18 patients with type 2 diabetes who had been managed on d-Nav® for 2.2 ± 1.0 years (mean ± SD), corresponding to about 110 autonomous insulin treatment plan (dosage) titrations per patient (i.e. about once per week) and 2500 individual autonomous dose recommendations per patient (i.e. recommendations for one to four insulin doses per day). For example, an insulin treatment plan titration could be a change in base lunch dose from 30 units with a correction factor of 1 extra unit for every 30 mg/dl above 120 mg/dl to 32 units with the same correction. An insulin dose recommendation could be for the administration of 32 units of rapid-acting insulin for lunch on a certain day. Table 1 shows demographics and key clinical characteristics. Duration of diabetes was 18.6 ± 7.6 years. The average glucose level on d-Nav® was 157.1 ± 29.6 mg/dl, and the glucose management indicator or CGM-reported HbA1c was 7.0% ± 0.6. Figure 1 shows CGM-reported glucose ranges according to standard reporting. For our primary outcome, the cohort spent 69.8% ± 18.5% of the time in range(TIR), meaning 70-180 mg/dl, nearly achieving the more stringent recommendation of >70% despite long-standing diabetes.7 The cohort spent 1.8% of the time below range (<70 mg/dl), which was superior to the recommended goal of percentages <4%. Time below 54 mg/dl was 0.3%, also superior to the recommended goal of percentages <1%.7 More than two-thirds of the time out of range was in near-hyperglycaemia (181-250 mg/dl; Figure 1). These values are consistent with the prioritization within d-Nav® to avoid hypoglycaemia. The coefficient of variation or glycaemic variability was 31.1% ± 6.4%, which met the recommended goal of ≤36%. Sensors were used 76.0% ± 26.6% of the time, which met the recommended >70%. TIR 6 months earlier, and hence closer to the beginning of the service, was 63.4% ± 24.1% and not statistically different than the value above. For our secondary outcome, average glucose concentrations over a period of 14 days were highly correlated with TIR (Pearson's r = 0.97; p < .0001). We found no correlation between the number of virtual/face-to-face interactions with the d-Nav® specialists over the past 6 months and patients' TIR. Table S1 details TIR and other CGM-acquired parameters in patients separated by their use of different insulin regimens. After initiation of the d-Nav® service, three patients had been transitioned by their physicians from basal-bolus insulin therapy to premixed insulin, all before the initial CGM reports were taken. Figure S1 depicts examples of reports of two CGM devices from two different brands. In this service evaluation, we report TIR and additional standard CGM parameters in patients who use insulin injections for long-standing type 2 diabetes and whose insulin doses have been autonomously titrated by d-Nav®. CGM parameters were favourable, with TIR at 69.8%. Comparing the d-Nav® service to AID systems, recently reported TIRs in patients who use AID systems were 60.6%,3 70.1%1 and 73.9%2 for patients with type 1 diabetes and 66.3%4 for patients with type 2 diabetes. The following are limitations of this service evaluation. First, the study was dependent on patients' willingness and ability to set up sharing of CGM data as part of remote clinical care. This limitation may have biased the results by possibly selecting for more technologically savvy individuals. On the other hand, the average HbA1c of this cohort was similar to the average in the d-Nav® Service in general after about 6-9 months of d-Nav® use,5, 6 suggesting a representative sample of the d-Nav® patient population. Secondly, the current report was not a randomized controlled study, but instead provides real-life retrospective observational data. Finally, another limitation of this study is the unavailability of data regarding the use of non-insulin medications. In our current cohort, average glucose concentrations and TIR were highly correlated, close to recommended goals for guideline-based care, consistent across insulin regimens and comparable with results from AID systems, which are more complex to use and intrusive. Our findings provide additional metrics of the overall favourable glycaemic profile that d-Nav® users regularly maintain. KJW, EB and IH designed the study and interpreted the data.

AI in business operations: driving urban growth and societal sustainability,2025,"Approximately 30% of smart city applications will use artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of 2025, thereby radically altering the urban sustainability landscape in the future (Yan et al., 2023). The advent of AI in reshaping traditional businesses into sustainable operations is evident. Whenever AI is brought to the forefront, it is considered a cornerstone in the business domain, enabling a transition towards more innovative and sustainable practices (Appio et al., 2024). Incorporating AI into business practices has many facets. According to Grand View Research (2023), the global AI market size was anticipated at USD 196.63 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. The recent fanfare surrounding AI has elevated it to a key enabler of sustainable development, prompting many companies to prioritize and integrate it into their business operations; hence, there is a stark difference between traditional and new practices. In tandem with this evolution, urban growth and societal dynamics are experiencing profound changes as AI-driven solutions come to the fore in various aspects of modern society (Shahidi Hamedani et al., 2024). AI applications in city government, transforming conventional cities into efficient ones (Ortega-Fernández et al., 2020), have significantly shifted from functional systems to more sustainable and intelligent ones. Furthermore, from another perspective, the role of AI in optimizing business processes has surpassed comparison with its implication for improving logistics operational capabilities and reducing environmental impacts (Jorzik et al., 2024a) till manufacturing reduces downtime, all of which contribute to the growth of urban economics. In the meantime, with the speedy pace of adoption of AI in business operations, it is also imperative to amalgamate with sustainable practices. Acting on this matter requires a thoughtful approach that aligns AI with social, economic, and environmental sustainability.The intersection of AI role and business operations has recently gained widespread attention. Some studies (Chen et al., 2024;Shahzadi et al., 2024)focused on AI's role in supply chain management, highlighting its role in minimizing inefficiencies and improving logistics by utilizing AI more often;supply chains become leaner and reduced carbon footprints, paving the path to sustainable operations. It is estimated that by 2026, 60% of businesses will adopt AI-powered warehouse solutions instead of just 10% in 2020 (MHI, 2024).In line with this shift, (Dilmegani & Ermut, 2025) note that businesses also invest heavily in warehouse robots to enhance their supply chain management through AI technology. Robots can manage operations more efficiently and accurately by automating picking, packing, sorting, and inventory management, thus saving labor costs and accelerating order processing. Amazon, for instance, has deployed more than 200,000 robots in its warehouses to optimize operations.AI can be used to optimize resource utilization, automate processes for improved efficiency, and enable real-time monitoring that aligns with sustainability goals (Waltersmann et al., 2021). As sustainable supply chain management focuses on reducing waste and enhancing traceability, AI-driven technologies such as machine learning and big data analytics have been pivotal in achieving these goals. (Tsolakis et al., 2023) Companies like eBay leverage AI for machine translation, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency . Similarly, Vodafone employs AI-driven analytics to personalize services, exemplifying its transformative impact. (Jorzik et al., 2024a).These technologies help reduce forecasting errors, minimize excess inventory, and lower energy consumption. (Sharma et al., 2020) Likewise, Smart grid protection sensors can detect defects up to 80% more accurately than traditional sensors, reducing losses and improving the system's reliability by adjusting to grid conditions dynamically (Mahadik, Sheetal et al., 2025). These applications contribute to urban economic growth by fostering technological innovation. AI leverages advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize dynamic business operations (Shuford, 2024). DRL improves supply chain management through adaptive routing and inventory optimization, dynamically adjusting to real-time changes in demand and logistics; with the help of DRL, researchers can develop systems that can dynamically adapt to changes, optimize resource utilization, and facilitate multi-objective decision-making for instance, (Dehaybe et al., 2024).In addition, it enables businesses to prevent equipment failures and minimize downtime, thereby streamlining workflows significantly (Mohan et al., 2021). Moreover, in urban centers, these advancements catalyze economic growth and foster innovation. In other words, a key contribution of AI is to facilitate smart urban development and efficient resource allocation, thereby ensuring that cities are resilient and economically prosperous (Li et al., 2024). In developing smart cities, AI has a transformative impact on urbanization trends. Through the application of AI, urban infrastructure can be optimized by improving energy efficiency, streamlining transportation, and managing housing needs; AI makes it possible to reduce traffic congestion and advance mobility in transportation systems, such as prescriptive traffic management and autonomous vehicles (Regona et al., 2024).In cities like Singapore, AI manages real-time traffic and monitors energy consumption, setting urban efficiency benchmarks (Padhiary et al., 2025). On a similar note, Tennet TSO, a German transmission system operator, has been utilizing AI-based forecasting and IBM Watson's cognitive computing platform to anticipate renewable energy generation in real time, allowing real-time grid adjustments and maximizing clean energy use. (Mahadik, Sheetal et al., 2025) 3Nowadays, sustainability is a debatable topic, and the role of AI in sustainability is inevitable. Reducing waste and environmental food print, optimizing resource utilization, and fostering a circular economy is the sprout of AI role which assists in a sustainable environment (Onyeaka et al., 2023); for example, in the agriculture industry, enhancing operational automation, a prediction model for the total agricultural output value (Sachithra & Subhashini, 2023), improving yields while reducing environmental impact. Moreover, this is apparent regarding the implications of AI and IoT in agriculture due to their ability to improve efficiency and sustainability. Agriculture leads the way with 35% of these technologies, followed by precision farming and irrigation monitoring at 16% each.Farming practices are becoming smarter and more sustainable due to these innovations, which increase yields, reduce waste, and conserve resources (Market.Us, 2024).Similarly, smart grid technologies optimize energy distribution, lowering carbon footprints (Bhattacharya et al., 2022). As manufacturing and logistics become increasingly automated, energy consumption and operational inefficiencies will be minimized and aligned with global sustainability goals (Garrido et al., 2024).By placing AI at the heart of sustainability, industries can grow while solving environmental and social issues. Moreover, businesses shift from traditional linear operations to circular, innovative, and efficient models (Pathan et al., 2023). The paradigm shift of AI contributes to sustainability from various aspects; for site surveying and progress monitoring, AI power drones are used to enhance decision-making, reduce energy consumption and minimize waste, and facilitate green finance in the agriculture sector and its application in the cultivation and harvesting phases (Fuentes-Peñailillo et al., 2024). While AI is crucial in ensuring sustainable business operations, implementing it brings several challenges, including ethical and privacy concerns (Fan et al., 2023).In urban planning and infrastructure, there are also notable examples; by using data and knowledge acquired by AI, cities can shift to another level and have the potential to revolutionize city development, which will enable over 30% of smart city applications by 2025, including urban transportation solutions, significantly enhancing urban sustainability, social welfare, and vitality (Herath & Mittal, 2022). Furthermore, AI-enabled robots are deployed in the hospitality sector to provide personalized services and facilitate seamless guest experiences (Szpilko et al., 2023).Similarly, in the healthcare industry, AI can detect and predict diseases rapidly and accurately (Rashid & Kausik, 2024). For instance, The PRAIM study in Germany assessed AI-supported mammography screening versus standard double reading. Out of 463,094 women screened, 260,739 were assisted by AI. With AI-supported screening, 6.7 cancers were detected out of 1,000, which is 17.6% higher than in standard screening. (Eisemann et al., 2025) Policies are needed to protect individual privacy in urban settings and solve concerns (Dong & Liu, 2023). AI technologies rapidly gain momentum in various industries but present challenges, including significant data security and privacy concerns. Data privacy and security protection are becoming an urgent concern (Saura et al., 2022). Acknowledging that AI adoption will have significant societal consequences, particularly when shifting employment patterns and consumer behaviors, is important (Yu et al., 2023). The rise of automation has displaced traditional jobs and created a demand for AIspecialized workers (Betts et al., 2024).AI's role in personalizing consumer experiences underscores the ethical responsibility to protect data privacy and mitigate algorithmic biases, maintaining public trust and equity. Governments and businesses must work together to implement reskilling programs to seamlessly transition to an AIdriven world. AI's Ethical concerns, like data privacy and the digital divide, underscore the need for transparent and inclusive AI solutions (Bouhouita-Guermech et al., 2023). These challenges are amplified in urban areas, where disparities in digital access can marginalize vulnerable populations. These issues can be solved only by collaborative efforts to design AI systems prioritizing societal wellbeing and inclusiveness.Several challenges exist, including data integration issues, AI literacy issues, resistance to technological change, data availability, and reliance on data (Uwaoma et al., 2024). In many industries, getting clean and actionable data is time-consuming and costly. As a result, AI models cannot produce satisfactory results without robust data, undermining their potential for sustainability. Moreover, AI adoption is complicated by ethical issues (Bouhouita-Guermech et al., 2023). Ensuring equal access to technology and data privacy must be addressed so that AI benefits all sectors of society. Additionally, fostering AI literacy within organizations is of utmost importance. Many organizations resist to change due to a lack of understanding, making it difficult for them to adopt AI-driven sustainability practices in the future.Moreover, lack of data (availability and quality) also remains a hurdle for implementing sustainability in business operations; in other words, accessing clean data is also opaque (Jorzik et al., 2024b); for instance, for training DRL's models, quality datasets are critical, and data within several sustainability contexts is both sparse and expensive to collect (Saliba et al., 2020).On the other hand, the reliability of data is also another concern; according to Choudhuri, (2023), 30 % of sustainability data is unreliable or has poor quality; having said that, incomplete data can fail any method of analysis and affect the decision-making process in other words without data-especially high-quality data-sustainable development is doomed to falter. A further concern is ensuring equitable access to AI since marginalized communities often face barriers to taking advantage of these developments (Kasun et al., 2024). The challenges highlighted here highlight the need for a balanced approach to AI deployment.Without AI, the prospects of adopting sustainable business practices are becoming increasingly bleak. However, Sustainable business demands the involvement of the government and the public sector.Governments must establish policies and regulations to promote transparency and collaboration to ensure high-quality data transfer to the private sector. Policies of this kind can foster cooperation between industries, facilitating the use of AI technologies responsibly and efficiently while addressing broader sustainability goals.The advancement of AI, however, is hindered by several limitations, including an unwillingness to change, ethical privacy concerns, and the difficulty of integrating new technology into pre-existing HR systems (Madanchian & Taherdoost, 2025). In addition, AI advancements are hampered by algorithms without common sense that cannot interpret data properly, resulting in flawed decisions (Nishant et al., 2024). As a result, clinicians' decision-making can be negatively impacted (Dratsch et al., 2023); for example, when prescribing antidepressants, clinicians were less accurate when following incorrect AI recommendations compared to a baseline or correct advice condition (Jacobs et al., 2021). The high cost of implementing AI in resource-intensive settings makes it difficult to reach a broad audience (Sommer et al., 2023). Additionally, organizational resistance to change creates a significant barrier to adopting AI in HRM since employees are reluctant to adopt AI due to concerns about data security, privacy, and possible job losses (Hassan et al., 2024).Businesses and industries are witnessing the impact of AI as a key driver of growth, which profoundly impacts businesses in various sectors. For instance, In the context of urban development, it can be implemented to improve traffic management, infrastructure, and public transportation scheduling in a way that contributes to more livable and sustainable urban development. AI can provide businesses with the means to optimize resources, reduce inefficiencies, and embrace innovative practices, enabling them to tackle urgent environmental and economic concerns. The full benefits of AI can only be realized if businesses align their operations with clearly defined sustainability targets. Achieving this requires a strategic approach to AI, not just a technical tool for generating short-term benefits.Policymakers must develop a reliable model that fairly and equitably fosters the use of AI in a broad range of sectors. Additionally, it would be beneficial for both the public and private sectors to work together to create inclusive solutions that will reduce societal disparities and protect the environment at the same time.As AI becomes increasingly integral to sustainability, it presents opportunities and challenges. A more sustainable market requires businesses to adopt AI to reduce costs; as McKinsey ( 2022), several companies have reported that AI forecasting engines reduce costs by 10% to 15% and improve their competitive position by automating up to 50% of workforce management tasks. However, the role of policymakers and urban planners in creating the conditions for AI innovations to thrive responsibly and inclusively cannot be overstated. Integrating AI into sustainable practices requires balancing technological advancements with ethical considerations. AI can be a powerful force for sustainable development if stakeholders create a collaborative atmosphere, address barriers, and promote transparency. As a result, businesses, societies, and the environment will all benefit. By examining the intersection of AI and urban sustainability in a new manner, the article introduces a fresh perspective to the literature because its analysis is not comprehensively covered in the current literature. It is valuable to synthesize existing literature to highlight trends and develop a strong foundation for understanding AI's role in business.","['business', 'operations:', 'driving', 'urban', 'growth', 'societal', 'sustainability']"
Monitoring and Controlling in the Process of Managerial Transformation of Enterprises,2025,"The article examines the role of monitoring and controlling in the managerial transformation of enterprises. Their importance for improving management efficiency, adapting to dynamic market changes, supporting strategic development, and ensuring sustainable operations is emphasized. Key issues hindering their implementation have been identified, including insufficient funding, the complexity of integrating systems into existing organizational structures, resistance to change from staff, and a low level of digital literacy among employees. The study outlines prospects such as the digitalization of business processes, the application of artificial intelligence, ERP systems, BI platforms, and Big Data for conducting analysis and forming real-time forecasts. The importance of adaptive management models is emphasized, as they enhance the flexibility and resilience of enterprises to external and internal challenges. The article also emphasizes the strategic importance of the agro-industrial sector for the Ukrainian economy, particularly its key role in ensuring food security and stimulating economic growth. Moreover, the study examines practical approaches to integrating monitoring and control systems into enterprise management processes. Modern technologies – specifically cloud ERP solutions, advanced BI platforms, and IoT (Internet of Things) – are analyzed as key factors for enhancing operational efficiency. The article provides recommendations for overcoming implementation barriers, such as investments in training and workforce development programs, which are crucial for employees to acquire the necessary skills for the effective use of advanced technological tools. Special attention is given to the agro-industrial sector, with a focus on its unique challenges and opportunities. The integration of monitoring and control systems is considered a tool for optimizing resource allocation, reducing operational risks, and improving decision-making processes. The article emphasizes the need for government support for digital transformation through financial incentives and the development of an innovative ecosystem. The research results indicate that the implementation of modern monitoring and control tools can significantly enhance the global competitiveness of enterprises, especially in sectors that are critical to the national economy.","['monitoring', 'controlling', 'process', 'managerial', 'transformation', 'enterprises']"
Harnessing Generative AI in Human Resources: A Strategic Approach to Cost Reduction and Workforce Optimization,2025,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology in human resource management, offering significant opportunities for cost reduction and operational efficiency. By automating and optimizing Human Resources (HR) processes such as recruitment, employee training, compensation management, and performance monitoring, GenAI empowers HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives. Tools like ChatGPT, Lumen5, and DeepL enhance efficiency by generating job descriptions, creating personalized training materials, and translating content, while also fostering inclusivity and adaptability in global contexts. Despite its potential, the adoption of GenAI poses challenges, including data privacy concerns, integration with existing systems, ethical considerations, and resistance to change among HR professionals and employees. This article outlines strategic pathways for successfully integrating GenAI into HR functions, emphasizing phased implementation, cross-departmental collaboration, and continuous professional development. It also advocates for promoting an inclusive organizational culture to build trust and acceptance of AI technologies. While this discussion highlights the potential and challenges of GenAI in HR, it underscores the need for empirical research to validate its effectiveness and guide its ethical application. Future studies are essential to establish evidence-based insights that will enable organizations to leverage GenAI for sustainable and responsible HR transformation.","['harnessing', 'generative', 'human', 'resources:', 'strategic', 'approach', 'cost', 'reduction', 'workforce', 'optimization']"
Advanced Information Technology: Improve Workplace Productivity with Balanced Scorecard Actions,2019,"Knowledge workers labor to meet their business goals with the support of practical information technology (IT) tools. IT advances can be organizational enablers, when aligned with business goals, and when selectively applied. Workplace leaders and their workers often experience a productivity paradox. This paradox forms an operational limit for current knowledge workers and organizational success. Performance management steps within a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework can help overcome workplace productivity paradoxes. The BSC frames and tabulates lagging and leading indicators of IT tools’ usage and soft skill engagements. These adaptive measures dashboard workplace progress and success for organizations of all sizes and in public and private sectors. Lessons can be learned from BSC deployment successes in several business sectors. Valued practices exist to pick / monitor / adapt organizational capability objectives, measures and HR initiatives. Can right IT tool(s) or application(s) help achieve aligned business goals? Yes. Certain IT applications can favorably frame learning and development (L&D) efforts and metrics for knowledge workers as most valuable players, or MVPs.How do knowledge workers and their business leaders manage and leverage these IT applications for employee L&D to improve organizational capabilities? How do they address and adapt to complex and chaotic business conditions, and manage disruptive technologies: a. Artificial Intelligence (AI), b. The Internet of Things (IoT), and c. Data Analytics? Prudent managers and workers can accommodate these conditions and disruptions with agile, productive BSC approaches to generate productivity-ware and to attain their aligned business goals.","['advanced', 'information', 'technology:', 'improve', 'workplace', 'productivity', 'balanced', 'scorecard', 'actions']"

MeTooBots and the AI Workplace,2021,"Responding to the #MeToo Movement, companies across the United States and Europe are beginning to offer products that use AI to detect discrimination and harassment in digital communications. These companies promise to outsource a large component of the EEO compliance function to technology, preventing the financial costs of toxic behavior by using AI to monitor communications and report anything deemed inappropriate to employer representatives for investigation. Highlighting the problem of underreporting of sexual harassment and positing that many victims do not come forward out of a fear of retaliation, these “#MeTooBots” propose to remove the human element from reporting and rely on AI to detect and report unacceptable conduct before it contaminates the workplace. 

This new technology raises numerous legal and ethical questions relating to both the effectiveness of the technology and the ways in which it alters the paradigm on which anti-discrimination and anti-harassment doctrine is based. First, the notion that AI is capable of identifying and parsing the nuances of human interactions is problematic as are the implications for underrepresented groups if their linguistic styles are not part of the AI’s training. More complicated, however, are the questions that arise from the technology’s attempt to eliminate the human reporter: (1) How does the use of AI to detect harassment impact employer liability and available defenses since the doctrine has long been based on worker reports? (2) How does this technology impact alleged victims’ vulnerability to retaliation when incidents may be detected without a victim’s report? (3) What is the impact on the power of victim voice and autonomy in this system? and (4) What are the overall consequences for organizational culture when this type of technology is employed?

This Article examines the use of AI in EEO compliance and considers whether the elimination of human reporting requires a reconsideration of the U.S.’s approach to discrimination and harassment. Appearing on the heels of revelations about the use of non-disclosure agreements and arbitration clauses to silence victims of sexual harassment, this Article posits that the use of AI to detect and report improper communications, an innovation that purports to help eradicate workplace harassment, may, in reality, be problematic for employers and employees alike, including functioning as a new form of victim abuse. Lastly, the Article considers the difficult work of creating open, healthy workplace cultures that encourage reporting, and the impact of outsourcing this work to Artificial Intelligence. Rather than rejecting what may be an inevitable move towards incorporating artificial intelligence solutions in the workplace, this Article suggests more productive uses of AI at work and adjustments to employment discrimination doctrine to be better prepared for an AI-dependent world.","['metoobots', 'workplace']"

Automation of Collection of Primary Data for Development of a Passenger Origin-Destination Trip Correspondence Matrix Based on Computer Vision and Neural Network Technologies,2021,"The origin-destination trip matrix is a fundamental characteristic of a transport network, and development of a reliable correspondence matrix is the most important task in organising passenger traffic. It is the basis on which the public transport route network of a city (region) is built and optimised. Currently, collection of initial information for construction of a travel correspondence matrix is carried out through field surveys comprising questionnaire surveys of the population; accounting for movement of passengers according to the coupons issued to them; checkers, tellers manually counting passengers in vehicle compartments; simple surveys of passengers. Besides, mathematical modelling is used based on statistical data on the number of residents in various districts of the city, employees in enterprises and students in educational institutions, as well as on available data on the characteristics of passenger traffic along certain routes. All these surveys are very expensive and are carried out once over few years; they give a large error, which is why decisions made on the basis of these data are far from being optimal. There are a lot of solutions in the software and hardware market that provide automated collection of data on passenger flows. They are based on the use of infrared sensors or of video recording. However, none of these systems provide information about the points of entry and exit of each passenger. The objective of this study was to develop methods for automating the collection of reliable information about passenger trips, that will be the base for building up-to-date and reliable passenger trip correspondence matrices. This task can be solved by constant monitoring of passengers’ trips with fixing places of entry and exit of each passenger. The study describes the possibility of creating software based on computer vision and artificial intelligence which will provide automation of collection of primary information about travel of each passenger from the place of boarding into the vehicle to exit from it, that is, automation of data generation to build a passenger trip correspondence matrix.","['automation', 'collection', 'primary', 'data', 'development', 'passenger', 'origin-destination', 'trip', 'correspondence', 'matrix', 'based', 'computer', 'vision', 'neural', 'network', 'technologies']"

The main part of the article is devoted to a detailed description of the six stages of a strategy for building a strong HR brand: audit and analysis of the current situation (internal and external), definition and formulation of the EVP, development of the HR brand strategy (goals, audiences, messages, channels, content), implementation of the strategy (integration into HR processes, engagement of ambassadors, communication campaigns, optimization of online presence), monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness (KPIs, data collection, surveys), and adjustment and optimization of the strategy.","['criticality', 'brand', 'strategies', 'international', 'marketing']"
Application of Information Technologies in the System of Legal Relations in the Field of Labor and Employment in the Russian Federation,2025,"This article analyzes the processes of digitalization in labor relations in the Russian Federation and identifies legal challenges arising from the implementation of modern information technologies in the field of labor and employment. It examines the regulatory framework for electronic HR document management, the legalization of the digital worker profile, and the legislative recognition of the status of individuals engaged in the platform economy. Particular attention is given to the problem of legal uncertainty in the field of labor relations, which stems from the accelerated integration of digital services, automated personnel management systems, and artificial intelligence technologies into recruitment, evaluation, and employee monitoring processes. The author analyzes existing gaps in Russian legislation related to the legal significance of electronic HR documents, the protection of workers' personal data, mechanisms for challenging decisions made by algorithmic systems, and the social status of platform workers. The article proposes potential avenues for improving the normative legal framework, including the development of a specific legal status for platform workers, the unification of stand-ards for maintaining digital labor profiles, and the implementation of algorithmic compliance and transparency mechanisms for automated decision-making in the sphere of labor relations. As a priority direction, the for-mation of a state digital HR accounting system, integrated with remote employment platforms and state infor-mation resources, is proposed, which will enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement practices in the con-text of the digital transformation of the labor market.","['application', 'information', 'technologies', 'system', 'legal', 'relations', 'field', 'labor', 'employment', 'russian', 'federation']"
Healthcare Violence and the Potential Promises and Harms of Artificial Intelligence,2024,"Abstract Currently, the healthcare workplace is one of the most dangerous in the United States. Over a 3-month period in 2022, two nurses were assaulted every hour. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to prevent workplace violence by developing unique patient insights through accessing almost instantly a patient’s medical history, past institutional encounters, and possibly even their social media posts. De-escalating dialog can then be formulated, and hot-button topics avoided. AIs can also monitor patients in waiting areas for potential confrontational behavior. Many have concerns implementing AIs in healthcare. AIs are not expected to be 100% accurate, their performance is not compared with a computer but instead measured against humans. However, AIs are outperforming humans in many tasks. They are especially adept at taking standardized examinations, such as Board Exams, the Uniform Bar Exam, and the SAT and Graduate Record Exam. AIs are also performing diagnosis. Initial reports found that newer models have been observed to equal or outperform physicians in diagnostic accuracy and in the conveyance of empathy. In the area of interdiction, AI robots can both navigate and monitor for confrontational and illegal behavior. A human security agent would then be notified to resolve the situation. Our military is fielding autonomous AI robots to counter potential adversaries. For many, this new arms race has grave implications because of the potential of fielding this same security technology in healthcare and other civil settings. The healthcare delivery sector must determine the future roles of AI in relationship to human workers. AIs should only be used to support a human employee. AIs should not be the primary caregiver and a single human should not be monitoring multiple AIs simultaneously. Similar to not being copyrightable, disinformation produced by AIs should not be afforded ‘free speech’ protections. Any increase in productivity of an AI will equate with a loss of jobs. We need to ask, If all business sectors utilize AIs, will there be enough paid workers for the purchasing of services and products to keep our economy and society a float?","['healthcare', 'violence', 'potential', 'promises', 'harms', 'artificial', 'intelligence']"
POS1428 IDENTIFICATION OF A WARM AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA (wAIHA) POPULATION USING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS OF A KNOWN CLINICALLY PROFILED COHORT,2022,"Background The disease burden of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), a rare disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) by pathogenic IgG autoantibodies, has not been well studied. At the time this claims database analysis was carried out a diagnostic code specific for wAIHA did not exist, which presented challenges in identifying patients with wAIHA. Objectives Despite the absence of a diagnostic code specific for wAIHA we aimed to 1) identify a wAIHA cohort using a collection of diagnostic codes, 2) bisect severe versus non-severe wAIHA patients, 3) compare the frequency of comorbidities, anemia symptoms, treatments, diagnostic tests, and healthcare provider visits in these two groups, and 4) use a predictive model to validate clinical variables and prevalence estimates. Methods A de-identified, longitudinal, patient-level claims database of &gt;300 million US patients was used for this study. Patients with wAIHA were identified based on a diagnosis code of “autoimmune hemolytic anemia” (AIHA), chronic use of steroids (≥30 days) in the last 36 months, and chronic use of non-steroidal immunosuppressants. Patients were classified as severe if claims related to transfusion, high frequency of blood testing, high frequency interactions with a hematologist, and/or ≥2 ER visits per year were observed in the 36-month period. Codes for anemia symptoms, comorbidities, treatments, and diagnostic tests were grouped and analyzed within the most recent 12 months for each patient. Prevalence was estimated using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) lookalike modeling, using known patients with wAIHA as the positive training class. Results A cohort of 1,548 patients with wAIHA was identified (n= 631 were classified as severe while n= 917 as non-severe). Median patient age was &gt;65 years, and patients were evenly distributed by gender. The rate of disease-relevant claims was disproportionately higher in the severe cohort versus the non-severe cohort. Over the 12-month study period, there was a 61% higher rate for anemia symptomatology codes and a 570% higher rate for wAIHA specific testing and monitoring codes in the severe cohort. Primary hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastro-esophageal reflux, and evidence of chemotherapy use were also present in wAIHA patients. All these conditions were observed more frequently in severe patients with the exception of lupus. Almost 44% of wAIHA claims for the full cohort were associated with Hospital/Emergency care - 48% for the severe group. AI/ML modeling predicted patients using claims variables for hemolytic anemia, other blood count abnormalities, and medical procedure claims commonly used for the diagnosis and management of wAIHA. The predicted population supports reported US prevalence estimates of 30,000-49,000 patients. Conclusion We developed and validated a method for defining wAIHA patients using de-identified claims data based on AIHA ICD-10 codes and relevant treatments. We observed that while disease manifestations are generally the same in the severe and non-severe wAIHA cohorts, there is an increased rate of occurrence in the severe cohort during the same 12-month period. This increase was also associated with higher utilization of healthcare resources. The comorbidity of lupus was more commonly associated with non-severe wAIHA patients. This may indicate that patients with a known diagnosis (in this case lupus) who are more closely monitored are less likely to reach the level of severity that would categorize them as patients with severe wAIHA.

Ergonomic Interventions in Risk Reduction,2025,"Ergonomics is a dynamic and multidisciplinary field that explores the interactions between people and various elements within systems. Its primary goal is to optimize health, performance, productivity, and satisfaction through the design and implementation of targeted interventions. These systems can range from simple setups, such as pen-and-paper, to complex sociotechnical infrastructures like large factories or agricultural systems. While its applications span all human activities, ergonomics often centers on workplace laws and occupational knowledge. This chapter highlights the significant role of ergonomic interventions in reducing workplace risks, particularly musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Modern ergonomic approaches leveraging wearable technology, virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) offer innovative solutions that support both physical and cognitive aspects of ergonomics. By focusing on adaptable and data-driven interventions, future ergonomic practices can align more closely with evolving workplace needs, enhancing risk management outcomes and improving employee well-being and productivity. Moreover, ergonomics impacts not only computer systems but also mobile platforms, wearable technology, IoT devices, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications. With the integration of machine learning and other emerging technologies, ergonomics now extends into real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. This allows for proactive intervention in diverse environments, thereby enhancing both individual well-being and system performance. Our chapter’s suggestions are intended for occupational safety specialists and safety managers, highlighting the necessity of continuous efforts and innovative solutions to advance ergonomic practices further.","['ergonomic', 'interventions', 'risk', 'reduction']"
A review of Machine Learning Techniques for Ergonomic Risk Assessment based on Human Pose Estimation,2025,"<title>Abstract</title> Human pose estimation (HPE) is emerging as an essential tool for ergonomic risk assessment (ERA) that allows for examining employees' occupational health and safety. Computer vision and machine learning technologies combined with observation-based ERA tools are turning out to be crucial methods in detecting and lowering work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Of the 210 research articles collected from the IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, 32 that satisfied the review requirements were chosen for in-depth examination. This review paper focuses on data collection, HPE, and ERA methodologies. To begin with, the paper reviews the latest research trends in data collection methods including depth cameras, marker-based motion capture, and deep learning-based pose estimation techniques. We then focus on connected body poses, two-dimensional and three-dimensional human pose estimation methods, and risk assessment levels using machine and deep learning algorithms. A variety of ERA techniques that offer useful frameworks for evaluating the ergonomic risks connected to various postures were examined. We observed that the deep learning-based HPE systems produced promising accuracies, but they struggled during real-time processing and occluded images. We investigate the potential of techniques that can strike a balance between performance and speed. The effects of HPE on ergonomics are examined, with an emphasis on how it might enable automated risk assessment systems, increase worker safety, and boost productivity. The survey concludes by exploring future research possibilities including the integration of multi-modal sensing, domain adaptation for various industries, and the creation of real-time, artificial intelligence-driven ergonomic monitoring systems.","['review', 'machine', 'learning', 'techniques', 'ergonomic', 'risk', 'assessment', 'based', 'human', 'pose', 'estimation']"
Issues of personal data protection when using cloud technologies,2024,"It is indicated that in today’s digital world, where the amount of stored and processed data is growing at a frantic pace, issues of personal data protection are becoming increasingly important. With the proliferation of cloud technologies that allow companies and individuals to store and process information on remote servers, a new spectrum of threats to data privacy and security is emerging. The article examines the issue of personal data protection when using cloud technologies, in particular, the need to integrate legal and technological aspects to ensure comprehensive protection. The impact of international regulatory acts, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Protection Act), on cloud data protection processes is analyzed.

КОНЦЕПТУАЛЬНІ ЗАСАДИ ВПРОВАДЖЕННЯ РЕІНЖИНІРИНГУ СЕРВІСНОЇ ДІЯЛЬНОСТІ ОРГАНІВ ПУБЛІЧНОЇ ВЛАДИ,2021,"Problem setting. Traditional mechanisms and management methods require new strategies for tools, there is an urgent need to reorient to modern management methods, the introduction of digital technologies in management processes to optimize and accelerate them. Creation of modern digital communications, the introduction of omnichannel, automation of standard operations, which increases the productivity of each employee, and in the future – the use of artificial intelligence for processing large data sets and full automation of public services. Modern public administration requires a fundamental rethinking and radical reengineering of management processes to achieve greater efficiency, improve service delivery quality and efficiency, and help increase the level of satisfaction of consumers of public services.
Recent research and publications analysis. At the beginning of the 21st century, scholars and practitioners are faced with the need to revise and modernize classical models, concepts, and digital tools of public administration. The issue of digital transformations and reengineering of public administration has been the subject of research by many foreign and Ukrainian scholars, but the scientific literature lacks research on the concepts and mechanisms of digital transformation and reengineering in public administration.
The paper objective – elucidation of perspective strategies of digital transformations of public administration, research of concepts and mechanisms of reengineering of service activity of public authorities, and development of offers on modernization of administrative processes.
The paper main body. Within the concepts of service-oriented public policy we can define the tasks facing the bodies of public introduction in the process of digitalization of public administration:
– increase the efficiency of process management through digital administration;
– development of digital interaction with citizens, provision of digital management services.
One of the methods of radically improving the quality of local government may be connected with the transition to e-government, reengineering of administrative processes. The vector of reengineering is the introduction of managerial innovations with the use of information and communication technologies, which, in turn, involves the implementation of active actions aimed at replacing the old capabilities of the state body with completely new ones.
Currently, there are the following approaches to management: process, system, and situational. The process approach treats the management system as a series of directly interconnected actions, each of which is a process – a management function. The process approach to management is based on the Deming-Schuhart cycle – a model of continuous process improvement, (PDCA cycle: P – Plan, D – Do, C – Check, A – Act). The development of the PDCA cycle with a large number of correlations, with zero deviation, and the use of elements of artificial intelligence should lead to fully automated processes of providing management services by public authorities.
The systems approach assumes integrity, which consists of interdependent parts, each of which characterizes the whole, and the organization is considered as a set of interconnected elements, such as people, structure, tasks, technology, and so on.
The situational approach is based on the fact that the priority of management methods is determined by the situation. Due to the fact that there are many factors both in the organization and in the external environment, there is no single best method of management.
Approaches to the management process are implemented through the introduction of management concepts. Business Process Management (BPM) is a concept that aligns an organization's strategy and goals with customer expectations and needs by customizing end-to-end processes. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a concept in which the recipient of services is given priority.
To optimize management operations and increase organizational efficiency, it is important to combine CRM and BPM technologies. As the core of the CRM system, BPM technology allows you to quickly transform management processes to meet changes in external conditions, giving users immediate access to all the necessary information they need, which significantly speeds up workflows.
Advantages of complex application of BPM technology of CRM-system in the field of service activity of public authorities:
– modeling, adjustment, and monitoring of processes;
– management of unstructured processes;
– clear and transparent work processes;
– process management in a single environment;
– advanced analytics;
– fast exchange of information due to integration into a single IT ecosystem;
– scalability, security, and mobile access to CRM;
– communication between structural units and service recipients.
The effectiveness of the CRM solution is achieved by the correct application of the process approach and its close connection with the strategy. The capabilities of the BPM system are the key to continuous improvement of the management model and increase efficiency by combining the efforts of all employees and departments of public authorities.
Conclusions of the research. The task of reengineering is to optimize the processes of providing public services. The object of reengineering is administrative processes, their optimization, and improvement, which allow to open and use new opportunities to improve management efficiency.
Integrated use of CRM and the concept of BPM realize the main goal of reengineering – the ability to build adaptation systems focused on the production and fulfillment of requests from public service visitors and built processes to ensure they get the maximum result with minimum financial and labor costs. The result of successful reengineering is the improvement of numerical indicators and the quality of services.","['концептуальні', 'засади', 'впровадження', 'реінжинірингу', 'сервісної', 'діяльності', 'органів', 'публічної', 'влади']"
Cybercrime threats in health-care establishments: Urgent need for action,2024,"Dear Editor, I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the escalating threats of cybercrime within health-care establishments, specifically in India. The health-care sector in India is currently undergoing rapid digitization, spurred by the need to provide continuous services during the pandemic, and government initiatives such as the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. However, this transformation has brought with it a substantial vulnerability to cyberattacks.[1] The recent cyberattack on a prestigious health-care institute in India, along with several attacks on hospitals in the nation's capital, has underscored the severity of the issue. These attacks disrupted critical services, compromised medical data, and exposed the personal health information of over 40 million patients, including prominent individuals. Such incidents are on the rise, with India ranking second only to the United States in healthcare-related cyberattacks in 2022, according to Indusface.[2,3] The implications of cyberattacks on health-care establishments extend far beyond immediate disruptions. They can have a cascading effect on the entire health-care system of a region, affecting patient care, increasing wait times, and even endangering lives, as evidenced by a ransomware attack on a San Diego Hospital in 2021. These attacks not only pose a direct threat to patient safety but also erode public trust in the health-care system. In addition, they open the door for malicious actors to manipulate sensitive patient data, potentially leading to unethical practices by insurance companies and compromised patient treatment decisions based on data-driven algorithms.[4] In 2022, reports indicated that the health-care industry in India faced a staggering 1.9 million cyberattacks. These attacks, stemming from various sources such as hacking, malware, and insider threats such as phishing e-mails, have the potential to cause extensive harm, ranging from service disruptions to the compromise of confidential health and financial data.[5,6] Key factors contributing to this vulnerability include outdated systems, vulnerable remote desktop protocols, server message blocks, and a lack of cybersecurity awareness among health-care personnel. The situation has worsened with the increased adoption of online systems for services such as telemedicine and teleconsultations.[7] It is crucial to recognize that while health-care personnel may be susceptible to cyberattacks, they can also play a vital role in detecting and reporting such incidents. To address this issue, health-care institutions are increasingly incorporating cybersecurity education and training into their defenses, teaching employees to recognize phishing e-mails and follow best practices for online security.[8] The financial costs of these cyberattacks are significant, including ransom demands and potential data recovery expenses. Equally damaging are the intangible costs, such as damage to reputation, compromised patient safety, and lost productivity. In addition to financially motivated cyber criminals, there is a growing concern about cyberattacks driven by personal or political motives, which may target critical medical devices and implants like pacemakers for nefarious purposes. In light of these challenges, I propose a multidisciplinary approach to establish a robust cybersecurity culture within health-care organizations. Cybersecurity should be viewed as a critical dimension of patient safety. Health-care organizations must invest in predictive, preventive, detection, and response mechanisms. Policymakers should allocate adequate funds and resources while enacting legislation to bolster cybersecurity in the health-care sector. SCOPE OF HANDLING CYBERSECURITY SITUATIONS BY PROGRAM MANAGERS Public health-care delivery systems at different levels require a comprehensive approach to address cybersecurity threats. Program managers in these systems play a pivotal role in implementing and managing cybersecurity measures. Emerging fields, such as artificial intelligence and realistic simulation exercises (e.g., penetration tests), can be used for predictive and preventive measures; the banking sector is indeed using the latest models to deal with cybercrime threats.[9] The following framework can be adapted for health-care delivery systems: Threat intelligence and artificial intelligence: Health-care organizations should gather and analyze data about cybersecurity threats to identify and prioritize risks. Collaborating with threat intelligence providers can enhance threat detection capabilities Behavioral Analytics: Implement machine learning and behavioral analysis tools to identify patterns of behavior that may indicate cyberattacks. This can help in early threat detection Security orchestration, automation, and response: Automate tasks related to cybersecurity, such as incident response and threat hunting, to improve efficiency and response times Risk-based approach: Prioritize cybersecurity efforts based on identified risks and vulnerabilities. Focus on areas most likely to impact the organization Regular testing and monitoring: Continuously test and monitor security controls to ensure they are effective and up-to-date Incident response plan: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines how the organization will respond to cyberattacks, including containment, recovery, and notification Cybersecurity awareness training: Regularly educate employees about cybersecurity risks and best practices to reduce the human factor in cyberattacks Vendor management: Vet and manage third-party vendors rigorously to ensure they meet security requirements. In conclusion, the threat of cybercrime in health care is a growing concern that demands immediate attention. By implementing comprehensive cybersecurity measures and fostering a culture of awareness and preparedness, health-care establishments can safeguard patient data and ensure the integrity of their services. We urge policymakers, health-care leaders, and cybersecurity experts to collaborate diligently to protect the critical health-care infrastructure from this ever-evolving threat.

Transforming to a Sustainable Visitor Economy With Information Systems,2024,"The global visitor economy sector, which includes tourism, hospitality and events, makes significant economic contributions. In 2023, there were 1.3 billion international tourist arrivals globally, with expenditure of $1.5 trillion (USD) (UN Tourism 2024). The Travel and Tourism sector contributed 9.1% to global GDP, a 23.2% rise from 2022, alongside 27 million new jobs, increased domestic spending surpassing pre-pandemic levels, and a substantial 33.1% boost in international spending, indicating that tourism has rebounded after the pandemic (World Travel and Tourism Council 2024). The global hospitality sector is worth around $4.7 trillion (USD) in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 7% (Hospitality Insights 2024). In the UK, the hospitality sector contributes significantly to the economy, contributing £93 billion (GBP) in 2023, supporting 3.5 million jobs as the third largest employer, and generating £54 billion (GBP) in tax revenue, £20 billion (GBP) in exports, and £7 billion (GBP) in business investment (UK Hospitality 2023). The global events sector, which primarily consists of sports, music events, conferences and festivals, was valued at $1.4 trillion (USD) (Claight 2024). Mega-events, such as the Olympics, have large economic impacts on the host country (Sato et al. 2024; Wolfe et al. 2022), including job creation and tourism revenues. For instance, the 2024 Paris Olympics is set to generate between €6.7 and €11.1 billion (EUR) net economic benefit to the region (Claight 2024) and create up to 247 000 jobs (CDES 2024). Concerts and world tours also impact economies, society and sustainability. Taylor Swift's Eras tour is estimated to have contributed £1 Billion (GBP) to the UK with spending on tickets, travel, accommodation and hospitality (Masud 2024). ABBA Voyage, a virtual concert in London, features avatars of the original band members created with motion capture technologies (ABBA Voyage 2024), boosted the London economy by £322 million (GBP) (Prynn 2024) and provides event goers with new types of entertainment. The visitor economy can also contribute to sustainability goals. For example, Cold Play's Music of the Spheres world tour aims to be as sustainable and low-carbon as possible (Cold Play 2024). In addition to the economic impact, the visitor economy also contributes to social and environmental sustainability, such as empowering women and young people in the workforce, transforming perceptions through intercultural encounters, advancing heritage preservations through educating and engaging with stakeholders, improving quality of life and reducing inequality in developing countries through community development. A sustainable visitor economy is crucial due to its scale, multifaceted benefits and potential impacts. Its importance is particularly evident as a significant economic driver in the destination and benefits the host community (Arnegger and Herz 2016). It has great potential for promoting social stability, cultural preservation and community engagement (Besculides, Lee, and McCormick 2002; Webster and Ivanov 2014). On the one hand, tourism, hospitality and events are a positive force in achieving sustainability goals (Higgins-Desbiolles 2006); on the other hand, there are many unethical and irresponsible environmental and local community issues (Buckley 2012; Milano, Novelli, and Cheer 2019), for example, due to its dependence and entanglement with fragile natural resources (Sisneros-Kidd et al. 2019), and the amount of waste generated (Diaz-Farina, Díaz-Hernández, and Padrón-Fumero 2023). It is, thus, essential to develop and implement sustainable strategies that maximize the positive impacts of the visitor economy while effectively addressing and mitigating its negative consequences, ensuring that the visitor economy supports a sustainability agenda that serves multiple stakeholders. Visitor economy outlets often refer to information technology (IT) over IS, and has long been extensively used in the visitor economy (Cai, Richter, and McKenna 2019; Navío-Marco, Ruiz-Gómez, and Sevilla-Sevilla 2018). Examples published within tourism, hospitality or events journals are broad. For example, recent research has explored artificial intelligence (AI) service failure (Lv et al. 2021), the impact of AI on tourism firms (Li and Chen 2024) and luxury hospitality (Gonçalves et al. 2024). Robotics has also been of recent interest across the visitor economy, for example, robots in tourism services (Liu et al. 2025), robot service failure in hospitality settings (Liu and Wang 2025), and the use of robots in events (Webster and Ivanov 2022). Other recent interests include virtual tourism (Liu, Moyle, et al. 2024), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality in tourism (Bec et al. 2021) and augmented reality (AR) in science festivals (Olya et al. 2020). However, there are few examples of visitor economy research in information systems (IS). Examples with a sustainability focus include sustainable ICT capability (Gholami et al. 2017), marine animal conservation (Tan 2018) and sustainable tourism in developing countries (Tsokota, von Solms, and van Greunen 2017). We believe that IS research can bring new insights and produce new knowledge for a sustainable digital visitor economy. In some of our previous work in tourism (Cai and McKenna 2021; Cai et al. 2021), we called on 'information technology and tourism' researchers to draw more from IS's rich history of theoretical development and methodological approaches. Thus encouraging tourism researchers to enhance their theoretical and methodological development. In this editorial, we call for IS researchers to work with the visitor economy to create a vibrant cross-disciplinary research community and bring to light the opportunities for us to research sustainable visitor economies. We see that opportunities in this field are numerous for impactful research. The motivation for this special issue was to uncover how IS research can bring new insights and produce new knowledge for a sustainable digital visitor economy, which includes the tourism, hospitality and events sectors. In the next section, we provide an overview of the role that IS can play in the visitor economy and offer illustrative examples of how IS can transform this sector by enhancing efficiency, personalisation and sustainability. IS can drive innovation and sustainable practices, making the visitor economy more responsive to the needs of all stakeholders. Following this, we offer a cross-disciplinary research agenda on transforming to a sustainable visitor economy, introduce the special issue papers and conclude with some remarks about the special issue. In the tourism sector, IT has been utilized by service providers, decision-makers or designers to provide sustainable solutions for the conservation of cultural heritage and endangered nature-based attractions. For instance, the role of smart technologies in heritage tourism development (Balakrishnan et al. 2023), machine learning in marine protected areas (Rezapouraghdam, Akhshik, and Ramkissoon 2023) and smart coastal destinations (Foronda-Robles, Galindo-Pérez-de-Azpillaga, and Fernández-Tabales 2023). Other research has showcased that user-generated content on social media has implications for the sustainability of whale-watching (León et al. 2025) and digital exhibitions utilizing VR in museums (Kim et al. 2019). In the hospitality sector, including hotels, restaurants, and health and wellbeing centres, among other service providers, IT-related research has explored using blockchain to mitigate food wastage (de Visser-Amundson, Kleijnen, and Aydinli 2023; Omar et al. 2024), the use of QR code menus as a sustainable solution (Ozturkcan and Kitapci 2023), using big data to understand emotions based on online reviews (Yu, Chen, et al. 2024), or avatar servers to promote healthier dining habits (Hao, Aman, and Zhang 2024). In the hotel industry, smart and sustainable hotels have been promoted as the next step forward (Casais and Ferreira 2023). Smart technology can be used, for example, to decarbonize accommodation services (Coghlan, Becken, and Warren 2023). The events sector, encompassing conferences, sporting events, concerts, mega-events such as the Olympics, and various forms of entertainment, has also significantly benefited from the integration of IT. Research so far has explored the use of mobile applications for event management (Revilla, Moure, and Einsle 2023), virtual music concerts (Sequeira Couto et al. 2023), such as the use of avatars in the ABBA Voyage concert in London (Matthews and Nairn 2023), low carbon ice rink technology for the Winter Olympics (Li et al. 2023), the digitalization of mega-events (Lee Ludvigsen and Petersen-Wagner 2023), virtual LGBTQI+ pride events (McKenna 2020), and the live streaming of sports events (Liu and Tan 2023). Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the visitor economy are essential in generating working opportunities and contributing to economic growth. IT adoptions, such as blockchain, facilitate SMEs' sustainable development and competitiveness with cryptocurrency payments (Nuryyev et al. 2020). Digital transformation and disruptive technologies adopted in the sector create new job opportunities for many, such as Uber, Airbnb and online travel agents and impact sustainable ecosystems (Leung, Xue, and Wen 2019). Smart destinations and infrastructure also play an important role in sustainability, with technologies such as the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing enabling resources to be used more smartly (Cimbaljević, Stankov, and Pavluković 2019). However, significant challenges persist for destinations and attractions that lack the necessary resources and capabilities for digitalization. Additionally, visitors and service providers with limited digital literacy are likely to face considerable difficulties in effectively engaging with smart infrastructure, which could hinder the broader adoption of these technologies. However, in the context of the visitor economy, IT represents a double-edged sword in terms of its impact on sustainability. From the visitor's perspective, on the one hand, IS applications significantly improve visitors' wellbeing through innovating visitor experiences (Gretzel and Stankov 2021), supporting accessibility for individuals with disabilities (Bazazo and Alananzeh 2016) and enabling alternative forms of engagement through virtual platforms, such as virtual tours in the Faroe Islands during the pandemic and virtual museum experiences offered by Google Arts and Culture (Jarratt 2021; Lu et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2022). These advancements have fundamentally reshaped how visitors interact with tourism offerings, making them more accessible and engaging. Additionally, virtual event platforms, such as online conferences and festivals, have allowed event organizers to reach a broader audience without the environmental impact associated with travel. However, from the visitor's perspective, questions persist regarding the long-term sustainability of these platforms, such as the environmental impact of increased energy consumption for virtual infrastructure, the economic viability of maintaining these services, and the risk of reduced user engagement over time. The increased reliance on IT has also been linked to various wellbeing issues, particularly in terms of blurring the boundaries between work and leisure, thereby undermining the concept of 'mental distance' when physically away (Floros et al. 2021; White and White 2007). From the perspective of operators and destination management organisations, emerging and disruptive technologies have primarily been applied to enhance operational efficiency, improve revenue management, manage tourism flows and sustain businesses. For example, IT to enhance efficiency in tourism and hospitality operations, contributing to more sustainable business practices (Lin, Shin, and Shin 2024), AI-driven solutions for crowd management in tourism (Vetrivel, Vidhyapriya, and Arun 2025), and immersive experiences afforded by extended reality (XR) and AI to preserve cultural heritage (Pistola et al. 2021). The adoption of green technologies in the hospitality sector has demonstrated potential for reducing environmental impact (Gunduz Songur, Turktarhan, and Cobanoglu 2023). Nevertheless, challenges such as overtourism, exacerbated by peer-to-peer accommodation platforms (Eckert et al. 2019) and the glamorization of certain destinations on social media (Gössling 2017), have led to conflicts between tourists and local residents (Mihalic and Kuščer 2022) and have imposed significant negative impacts on destinations ill-equipped to handle large volumes of visitors (Seraphin, Sheeran, and Pilato 2018). From an employee perspective, the integration of AI and service automation has provided considerable support by reducing repetitive tasks, thereby enhancing employee wellbeing. However, the implementation of these technologies has also raised concerns regarding job security, particularly within the hospitality sector (Koo, Curtis, and Ryan 2020; Li, Bonn, and Ye 2019). These concerns are especially evident among the female workforce, which constitutes a substantial portion of employment in the visitor economy (Ismail 2018). Women are often concentrated in roles more susceptible to automation, such as front-desk services and housekeeping, rendering them particularly vulnerable to job displacement as AI and automation technologies become more prevalent. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1 aim to promote sustainable development globally; however, their implementation has occasionally led to unintended consequences that may undermine sustainability efforts. For instance, badly managed social media induced tourism may lead to overtourism, resulting in negative impacts on destinations such as tourists wearing inappropriate clothing, causing noise or invading local residents' personal space (Siegel, Tussyadiah, and Scarles 2023), ultimately counteracting the intended goals of sustainable development. The increased use of IT to optimise tourism marketing and manage visitor flows can inadvertently lead to overtourism, resulting in data-driven promotion that overwhelms local infrastructure, strains resources and degrades natural environments, ultimately counteracting the intended goals of sustainable development. We argue that the role of IS in shaping the sustainable visitor economy cannot be overstated. The integration of advanced data analytics, AI, immersive communication platforms and digital transparency frameworks offers promising pathways for addressing the SDGs. However, these technological interventions must be implemented with careful attention to ethical implications, data privacy and socio-economic impacts to ensure they contribute meaningfully to the broader research agenda on sustainable visitor economy. The subsequent sections examine how IS (instead of IT) can revolutionise data collection, sustainable operations and stakeholder engagement while emphasizing the importance of ethical and inclusive practices in promoting sustainability within the visitor economy, ultimately fostering a more resilient and inclusive future. Future research should focus on the innovative applications of data collection and analytics (DCA) to advance SDGs within the Visitor Economy. Leveraging generative AI to develop more accurate predictive models for tourist behaviour and trends remains an essential area for enhancing data-driven decision-making (Cheng et al. 2024). By enabling more precise resource allocation, these models can optimize resource usage, minimize waste and reduce carbon footprints, directly contributing to responsible consumption (SDG 12) and climate action (SDG 13), thus supporting sustainable tourism practices (Kashem et al. 2022). Data-driven insights can help address food insecurity (SDG 2) by optimizing food supply chains in hospitality settings, minimizing food wastage and ensuring efficient distribution of resources where they are needed most. Data-driven insights can also identify economic vulnerability in tourism communities and promote targeted interventions to alleviate poverty (SDG 1). Understanding tourist arrival fluctuations helps implement support, skill development and job opportunities, ensuring inclusive growth and strengthening resilience. It is critical to establish robust frameworks to ensure the ethical handling of health data (Reddy 2024) within the visitor economy, thereby preventing misinformation and mitigating health crises (SDG 3). For instance, managing health data related to guest safety and wellbeing is paramount in hospitality to build trust and ensure a positive experience. Research focusing on privacy concerns (SDG 16) should evaluate improved methods for safeguarding personal data, such as guest health information (Law, Ye, and Lei 2024; Shuqair et al. 2024), while maintaining the benefits of advanced analytics for enhancing services and operational efficiencies. Incorporating machine learning into predictive analytics can further enhance the ability of tourism operators (Hu et al. 2025) to identify patterns and make proactive decisions, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and efficient resource management. Such predictive capabilities can also support the efficient use of water resources, which aligns with SDG 6 by promoting water conservation in tourism hotspots and hospitality settings, reducing water scarcity impacts, and enhancing sustainability efforts in hotels and resorts. This application aligns with SDG 9 as it encourages the use of advanced technologies to build resilient infrastructure, foster innovation and promote sustainable industrial practices (Pérez López et al. 2024). Furthermore, leveraging DCA can facilitate collaboration between public and private stakeholders, helping bridge knowledge gaps and foster partnerships for sustainable development (SDG 17). Such collaborations can drive unified efforts towards sustainability goals, enabling shared learning and effective resource management within the visitor economy. The adoption of big data, AI, machine learning (Spalding et al. 2023), or IoT (Tiwari, Rosak-Szyrocka, and Żywiołek 2022) for sustainable resource management is a promising field for exploration. By enhancing operational efficiencies and enabling data-driven decision-making, these technologies can significantly optimize resource usage in the visitor economy. This not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also bolsters the competitiveness and appeal of destinations, ultimately strengthening the visitor economy by ensuring a high-quality, sustainable experience for guests. Future research should examine how these IS can be optimized to promote energy efficiency and minimize carbon footprints (SDG 7 and 13). Further studies should investigate how AI can effectively predict energy needs (Vieri et al. 2024) specific to the peak demand patterns in visitor economy operations. Such predictive capabilities support sustainability efforts by reducing energy overuse while maintaining the high standards of service quality expected in these industries. Efficient use of water resources, monitored through IoT, contributes to achieving SDG 6 by improving water management in tourism, hospitality, and event facilities, ensuring sustainable usage and minimizing water waste across these key sectors. Robotics can also play a critical role in resource management within hospitality settings by automating housekeeping and other repetitive tasks (Wu and Zhang 2024), thereby reducing energy consumption and improving operational efficiency. This aligns with SDG 9, which promotes the adoption of resilient and sustainable IS to enhance industrial processes. Robotics contributes to innovation by streamlining operations (Liu, Gu, and Liao, 2024), reducing human error and fostering sustainable practices, ultimately helping to build a more resilient and energy-efficient infrastructure within the hospitality industry. Future research should investigate how immersive communication platforms, for example, including AR, VR, XR and the metaverse, can enhance stakeholder engagement and visitor experiences in the visitor economy (Chung, Goebert, and Johnson 2024; Gonçalves et al. 2024; Kostyk et al. 2024). Specifically, more studies are needed to understand how such technologies can foster inclusivity while mitigating the digital divide (SDG 10). These IS hold significant potential for enhancing social inclusion (Gonzalez-Jimenez and Costa Pinto 2024) by providing virtual experiences for those unable to travel due to physical, economic or social barriers, thereby expanding accessibility within the visitor economy. Immersive technologies can also be instrumental in the protection and preservation of natural and cultural heritage (Bec et al. 2019) (SDG 11 and 15) by offering immersive virtual tours of cultural events and heritage sites, reducing physical impacts on fragile environments while promoting broader awareness and appreciation. The integration of avatars into these virtual platforms can create more personalized and interactive experiences (Nan et al. 2023), allowing users to engage with content in a more immersive and emotionally connected manner. This aligns with SDG 9 as it fosters innovation in digital experiences and supports the development of resilient digital infrastructure that can enhance user interaction (Shin and Kang 2024). By integrating avatars, the tourism and hospitality sectors can improve customer engagement through innovative technology, ultimately contributing to sustainable infrastructure that meets evolving consumer needs. Research should consider the unintended consequences of problematic social media use, including misinformation and its impact on the wellbeing of tourists and visitors, as well as on sustainability goals (Mkono and Hughes 2023) (SDG 3, SDG 11, and SDG 12). Social media can negatively affect tourists' perceptions, contribute to stress through misinformation, and influence travel behaviours in unsustainable ways, ultimately impacting both individual wellbeing and broader sustainability efforts (Wengel et al. 2022). Furthermore, social media's emphasis on 'Instagrammable' destinations has contributed to overtourism (SDG 11), encouraging irresponsible tourist behaviours that often negatively affect local residents. The increased focus on visually appealing spots can lead to overcrowding (Song and Abukhalifeh 2021), strain local resources, and disrupt the quality of life for local communities, further undermining the goals of sustainable tourism and responsible consumption (Ganzaroli, De Noni, and Bonera 2021) (SDG 11 and SDG 12). The role of generative AI in transforming customer interactions in the visitor economy warrants deeper exploration, especially in terms of how it can personalize guest experiences and streamline customer service. For example, generative AI chatbots can be used to provide tailored recommendations to tourists (Xu et al. 2024), which may support SDG 8 by enhancing service efficiency and improving job quality. However, the ethical implications of over-reliance on digital communication, such as diminished human contact (Samala et al. 2020) and potential biases in AI-driven interactions, need to be considered to ensure inclusivity and fairness, aligning with SDG 10 and SDG 16. Research into transparency systems, such as blockchain, should be expanded to support various aspects of the visitor economy (Gao and Bi 2024; Muharam, Tussyadiah, and Kimbu 2024), including governance, sustainability and visitor engagement (SDG 16). Blockchain technology can create transparent, immutable records of transactions, such as hotel bookings or event ticket sales, which helps build trust and accountability within the visitor economy. Blockchain's ability to support secure, decentralized systems also aids in managing supply chains, offering visibility into the origin and sustainability of products used in tourism and hospitality (Özgit and Adalıer 2022), thereby contributing to responsible consumption (SDG 12). AR and VR can enhance stakeholder meetings by allowing remote participants to immerse themselves in the environment of a destination or hotel, thereby fostering more informed decision-making and enhancing collaboration (Fazio et al. 2023). The metaverse can facilitate virtual governance forums where stakeholders, for example, community members, policymakers and investors, can interact and discuss tourism management plans in a shared virtual space, promoting inclusivity (SDG 10), effective governance (SDG 16) and fostering collaborative partnerships for sustainable development (SDG 17). Investigating the integration of AR to provide guests with real-time, immersive views into sustainability practices (Cranmer, Tom Dieck, and Jung 2023) could further enhance transparency and trust. However, future studies must also address the potential risks related to unethical data use and the challenges associated with unequal resource distribution, which may hinder effective transparency efforts. The use of drones for monitoring and ensuring compliance with sustainability initiatives also represents an emerging area of interest. Drones can provide real-time data on environmental conditions (Zahir et al. 2024), helping destinations maintain transparency about their sustainability practices. This aligns with SDG 13 as drones facilitate the monitoring of environmental impacts, enabling destinations to implement proactive measures for mitigating climate-related risks. Additionally, drones contribute to SDG 9 by integrating advanced technology into infrastructure management, promoting innovation in how destinations handle environmental challenges. The intersection of e-learning, AI, and immersive technologies as tools for workforce development and visitor economy education presents numerous opportunities for future research (SDG 4 and 8). However, critical consideration is needed regarding the digital divide and the accessibility of these technologies (Lythreatis, Singh, and El-Kassar 2022), directly impacting SDG 10. While AI can be used to personalise training programmes, adapting learning experiences to the needs of individual learners, thereby improving the effectiveness of visitor economy education (Skavronskaya, Hadinejad, and Cotterell 2023), it also risks reinforcing existing inequalities. For instance, those without access to reliable internet or advanced digital devices may be excluded, deepening socio-economic divides (SDG 10). From a critical theory perspective, such as Foucault's concept of power and knowledge, the push for digital learning technologies could be seen as a form of disciplinary power, where those with access gain advantages in skill development, while those without are further marginalized (Cai and McKenna 2023). These dynamics challenge the principle of equality and inclusivity, highlighting tensions in achieving SDG 4 and SDG 10. Additionally, AI-driven analytics, while capable of identifying skill gaps and providing targeted training content, can introduce biases that shape what kinds of knowledge and skills are valued, potentially perpetuating exclusionary practices that conflict with SDG 5 and SDG 10. Furthermore, the design of these training programmes often reflects Eurocentric perspectives, raising questions about the validity and relevance of the knowledge being prioritized. This can lead to situations where local and indigenous knowledge are side-lined, thus undermining cultural diversity and inclusivity (SDG 5 and SDG 10). Exploring the use of metaverse platforms to create adaptive, immersive learning environments (Saneinia et al. 2024) is an important next step, but these efforts must also critically examine who is designing these systems, whose knowledge is being represented, and who ultimately has the power to access and benefit from these innovations. Future studies should evaluate the socio-economic impacts of introducing advanced digital infrastructure, including metaverse and XR technologies, to ensure they do not exacerbate existing inequalities. Exploring how AR and XR can create new opportunities for remote participation and virtual tourism (Miao et al. 2024) is vital for fostering inclusive tourism practices. These technologies can also contribute to reducing poverty (SDG 1) by providing new income opportunities for local communities. Studies should focus on not only creating standardized, high-quality content but also ensuring that such content includes local and indigenous knowledge and is accessible to all, including those who may be unwilling or unable to engage with advanced technologies, thus upholding the values of inclusivity, equal opportunity and cultural relevance (Gretzel et al. 2020) (SDG 4, SDG 5, and SDG 10). Future research should investigate gender-sensitive AI and generative AI applications that create tailored content and opportunities for underrepresented groups in tourism, hospitality and events (SDG 5 and 8). Examining the efficacy of these technologies in overcoming cultural and resource barriers that restrict women's access to technology and economic opportunities is an area requiring significant attention (Khoo et al. 2024). However, it is also essential to critically question the underlying design of these technologies. For example, virtual worlds can provide safe spaces for LGBTQI+ people (McKenna and Chughtai 2020), but to achieve that, LGBTQI+ members had to shape the affordances of the technology for their own purposes (McKenna 2020). Technology, including AI, often embodies masculine biases by design, which risks reinforcing gender stereotypes rather than dismantling them (Varsha 2023). For example, gender-sensitive AI can be used to empower women hos","['transforming', 'sustainable', 'visitor', 'economy', 'information', 'systems']"
Financial Sustainability and Technology Integration in Oil &amp; Gas Cooperatives: Opportunities and Challenges,2024,"The oil and gas sector remains a critical component of the global economy, contributing significantly to energy supply, employment, and economic development. However, with growing environmental concerns, market volatility, and operational complexities, maintaining sustainable operations has become increasingly challenging for industry players. This paper delves into the role of financial sustainability and technology integration within oil and gas cooperatives, focusing on the opportunities and challenges that arise from this dual approach. The paper highlights the importance of cooperatives in addressing these challenges by ensuring operational efficiency, fostering innovation, and promoting sustainable development. The integration of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) offers substantial benefits for cooperatives operating in the oil and gas sector. These technologies enable organizations to optimize resource allocation, streamline operational workflows, and implement predictive maintenance models to reduce downtime and equipment failure. Furthermore, IoT-based monitoring systems ensure real-time visibility of key operational metrics, allowing for proactive risk management. Financial sustainability, on the other hand, involves implementing robust financial models to manage cash flows effectively, forecast economic risks, and align business strategies with market demands. The interplay between financial sustainability and technology integration allows cooperatives to maximize profitability while reducing environmental impact, contributing to broader sustainability goals. A case study on Shell Nigeria’s Cooperative Society in Port Harcourt is presented to provide practical insights into the application of these principles. The study demonstrates how Shell’s cooperative has utilized IoT-based solutions and predictive financial models to ensure sustainable growth and efficient project execution. The cooperative plays a pivotal role in managing employees’ thrift and loan operations, generating significant value through real estate investments and technology-driven initiatives. By adopting innovative tools and sustainable practices, the cooperative not only ensures operational resilience but also contributes to socio-economic development in the communities it serves. Mathematical models, such as Net Present Value (NPV) analysis, are employed to illustrate the financial optimization strategies used by Shell Nigeria’s cooperative in evaluating project profitability. Diagrams depicting the integration of technology and financial systems further highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach. Through these models, the paper demonstrates how financial decision-making is enhanced, ensuring that investments align with long-term sustainability goals. This study explores the broader implications of integrating technology with financial sustainability in oil and gas cooperatives. It emphasizes the importance of building public-private partnerships to attract investment and foster technological innovation. Additionally, the paper discusses the regulatory landscape and the need for cooperatives to align with global sustainability standards. The findings suggest that cooperatives in the oil and gas sector have a unique opportunity to drive economic resilience and environmental stewardship through effective financial management and advanced technology deployment. The paper provides actionable recommendations for cooperatives seeking to achieve financial sustainability and operational efficiency through technology integration. These recommendations include upskilling employees, enhancing data management capabilities, and establishing strategic partnerships to overcome challenges. The research underscores the importance of cooperatives in achieving sustainable development within the oil and gas sector, making a compelling case for aligning business strategies with emerging technologies and financial best practices.

Eyes on Air,2021,"Abstract We at ADNOC Logistics &amp; Services have identified the need for a Fully Integrated Inspection and Monitoring Solution to meet our operational, safety and security objectives. It also helped us in our journey toward becoming a world-class integrated logistics services provider. We have a mandate to manage complex logistics operations while being flexible in services delivery by adopting the latest technology and leveraging strategic partnerships. ADNOC L&amp;S adopted autonomous drone technology from Percepto in most of its critical operations. The artificial Intelligence in the drones automatically detects abnormal changes in working environment as well as unsafe acts and conditions and helps employees be more aware of them especially during routine activities. Finally, it helps management take immediate action to address unsafe conditions as soon as they occur. Visual inspections play a big role today in asset management. In fact, they're considered a best practice for ensuring safer and more productive operations. Being able to conduct visual inspections routinely leads to early detection of issues and damages that might become failures. In this way, visual inspections ultimately help minimize incidents. Yet visual inspections are not limited to preventing and minimizing incidents, but organizations also get value from real time monitoring of procedures such as planned shutdowns of specific assets such as a flare stack inspection. During construction, having the ability to monitor work that is being conducted in real time helps minimize the overall downtime. This can translate into saving hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars. Inspections are vital and even crucial for business continuity. Yet, today visual inspection is far from being optimized. The end to end process is not at all efficient. And surprisingly, most companies and most sites still conduct visual inspections manually, not automatically. This type of inspection is labor intensive, takes a lot of time, and can even put employees at risk. Overall, manual inspection is an inefficient process. Consider the siloed workflows that comprise the overall inspection. You start with having to fetch the data and collect it. This involves sending people to the site with special equipment. It can also involve climbing up high structures or putting people into potentially dangerous positions. All of this is manual time-consuming work. When this is done, the data needs to be somehow transferred to people who are going to be analyzing it. They need to have a particular type of expertise and experience in managing visual data. Once they go over the data, they need to create or define some insights and share their findings with the relevant stakeholders. Yet again, this is a labor intensive and lengthy process. It's also costly. Fortunately, it does not have to work this way, as there is lots of room for automation. Each of the siloed workflows from autonomous capture visual data management to insights are starting to be automated. Note that typically, this is not an end to end automation. Organizations that are doing data capture of their facilities with drones, robots, piloted drones, are in most cases, automating data capture and are able to collect data more quickly, more easily without having to risk anyone. They are on the first step towards automation. Some organizations inspect their facilities with third party software that is capable of getting the data, storing it, and managing it in one place. This leaves them dependent on outside sources, which can slow the process and potentially be unreliable. Finally, there's some software solutions available that are unable to automate some of the insights. So, organizations have multiple options to begin automating inspections. Yet, none of these options provide a full holistic solution for inspection. This is where this technology comes into the picture with the AIM. AIM is the only end to end autonomous inspection and monitoring solution. It automates every step of the process holistically; from capturing the data, through managing it, all the way to sharing insights with different stakeholders. Let's look at the details related to each step of the process. First, there's automating data collection. We use autonomous robots in the form of a drone in a box. Companies have the autonomous drone on site, and they are fully operated by software. They are available as needed for running inspections. Companies can schedule inspections when they want and as often as they want – without outside assistance. This is the first step towards holistic automation. The second aspect of holistic automation has to do with the visual data management. It's not enough to automate the data collection, which is very complex in and of itself. Of what value is the data if it is not able to be used? Therefore, it's even more important to be able to gather all the data, store it in one place, tag it, and sift through it in order to eventually gain insights. And it should be easy to share those insights with relevant stakeholders from various departments. This promotes teamwork and allows everyone to feel involved in the process and add their own valuable insights. A user can simply request information for specific assets, and drones will be dispatched automatically. Plus, insights will be delivered for the user or users who requested the data. While this may sound futuristic, we at ADNOC are already using it to inspects our sites. The concept behind the operation of the AIM is fairly simple. It starts with deploying autonomous drones on site. Companies gain high quality insights with once-a-day inspection. The frequency of inspections and their consistency, because it's the same robots that go day after day and collect the data, lead to high level insights. The same robot or drone collecting data at the same time each day allows for regular comparison and strengthens anomaly detection. This is exactly what companies need - get the right insights that help ensure asset integrity, the completion of proper preventive maintenance, etc. A few concerns arise however when considering adopting an autonomous drone solution: namely - drone regulation and privacy. Drone regulators are understandably concerned about drones flying over people, operating remotely and in darkness or inclement weather, and – critically – the dangers of uncoordinated flights interfering with other aircraft. That's why when going through all the necessary requirements with all authorities in getting the approvals for autonomous to gained approval to operate drones beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), which enabling this solution to be operated remotely without the need for an operator on site. When talking about drones and privacy, there's a huge difference between piloted recreational and autonomous industrial drones. Recreational drones cause the majority of drone accidents because they're flown by unlicensed pilots in public spaces with minimal supervision. Autonomous industrial drones fly in remote or rural locations, far from people, and have multiple built-in failsafes and advanced safety features like parachutes to eliminate injuries and mishaps. Now - let's take a deep dive to learn how drones in autonomous inspection solutions can benefit refinery inspections. We've been deploying the AIM for their end to end solution as part of our vision of creating and being part of the future. It is integrating multiple cutting edge technologies in order to guarantee safer and more productive operations. Different teams – from operations to maintenance, to emergency response and others - in our organization are getting value from having this technology. Note, the technology is applicable to any type of industrial site, construction site, and of course, oil and gas industry. Regardless, they all benefit from the autonomous inspection and monitoring technology to cater different use cases across the lifecycle, from construction of a new site, through the ongoing operation, we're using it for emergency response, and even for periodic complex projects, such as turnarounds. Companies have deployed the solution to monitor the construction of new refineries that they are building. Having the autonomous robots on site daily is especially helpful because it enables them to collect data and easily monitor what's going on throughout the construction work. It enables companies to ensure that schedules are met, verify that the work has been completed, and that it is consistent with the plans. In one instance, a company was able to recognize that contractors were not fulfilling their promise. The contractors were supposed to send a team that included a specific number of people. By having a drone provide visibility of what was going on at the site with this the supervisors were able to count how many people were on site. The supervisors realized that the actual size of the team on site was much smaller than promised. By being aware of this sort of thing and being able to verify it, whether in real time or at the end of the day, a company can make better decisions and be clear if things are proceeding according to plan. Having the drones on site collecting visual data and providing companies with visibility to know what's going on throughout the construction work. It can also help to enforce compliance with both environmental and safety standards. Consider, the drone is streaming data in real time, and generating reports at the end of the day, and/or at the end of the week, depending on the configuration done on site. The reports can be checked for things such as whether people were wearing their safety gear, their PPE, whether they were going on to restricted areas. In addition to allowing for awareness, it also it's a form of proof as to what happened on site that you can use later, should the need arise. Once construction is complete, it's time to consider ongoing operations. This is where the largest number of use cases can be found in the day to day operations of a refinery or any other oil and gas facility. An autonomous inspection and monitoring solution is used for various use cases, including inspections of tanks and pipes, and chimneys and flare stacks. It can be using a high-res visual camera for inspection or thermal inspection. Since the drones are also equipped with onboard artificial intelligence capabilities, AIM is also capable of detecting things like oil leaks, gas leaks, structure failures and more. One of the great advantages of having such high frequency inspections with the very same drones collecting data day after day or week after week is the fact that it leaves a company with historical data. And when applying AI, it can provide a lot of insights that otherwise (think periodic inspections or even manual inspections which capture a fraction of what is going on) would have been very difficult to gain. Here are some other examples of how using the historical data and applying anomaly detection is helpful. It can easily detect things like rust on top of tanks, or objects that were left behind. These things start off as minor things but if left to grow can become significant problems. By the way, the drones are equipped with thermal cameras to see things that are not even visible at all, when you're just flying piloted drones. We found this helpful when on one of the very first flights, we realized with thermal imagery that we had a problem with insulation of pipe that was going on underground. Furthermore, the solution enabled to have a very early detection of this problem. And this again only happens because of high frequency inspections, and also visual and thermal and applying AI at the same time to gain invaluable insights and to be alerted on time. Again, a key element to keep in mind regarding the solution is that a person doesn't have to be there in front of the system analyzing what the robots are collecting. This is done via AI which is able to provide valuable insights. Next, there's emergency response as it is related to both security and safety. First of all, the solution can be used to augment the security teams and run security patrols. This can be done with drones. Companies can schedule the system to go on as many patrols a day that is appropriate for their facility. These patrols augment the security team and provide a lot more situational awareness. Another security benefit is being able to apply AI in the form of detection and tracking of people and vehicles. So, as soon as the robots identify suspicious objects, they can start to automatically track that object. People can make decisions about the necessity to take action or not from a safe distance. Companies also can control the robots ad hoc for immediate response. In the control room, companies get a call saying that people identified smoke. Upon hearing this, a drone is dispatched. Within minutes, they have situational awareness, even before the first responders even got on to the relevant area. This enables companies to direct the first responders as to where the smoke is coming from and how to get to it, which alleviates the risk they would have experienced if they went in blind. Another example is being able to do advance planning for storms and excessive temperatures. Now, you can never be completely prepared for an emergency. But with the solution available on hand, preparation can occur before the storm occurs in the form of running a quick inspection to see whether some areas are more prone to failure and issues could arise in that location due to the storm or excessive temperatures. Once the storm is over, the drones can be quickly dispatched to identify those areas that became faulty and require maintenance. This saves valuable time as instead of sending maintenance crews to go and look for problems, maintenance crews can be immediately dispatched to fix the problems that were spotted by the drones. Keeping service in operation and minimizing downtime is sure to please customers and clients. It can also mean a lessening of environmental damage. The last major lifecycle phase, where the solution is being used, is turnaround. In terms of turnaround, suddenly there are hundreds of employees that are not necessarily familiar with the site going there for the sake of conducting the turnaround work. Remember, every day and even every hour and minute beyond the expected turnaround time means a loss of money for a facility. Autonomous inspection and monitoring can help minimize this in three ways. Time and tools help with productivity. During turnaround times, often there are long lines that form – it could be during lunch, break times, upon arrival in the morning, a changing of the shift in the morning, etc. During these times, when employees are getting in and out of the facility, the robots can provide visibility and maintain visual awareness. Another benefit is that by knowing where lines are building up, a remedy might be found that can mitigate the issue and get people back to work quicker so more time is spent on the job. Maximizing time and tools can translate into a lot of money for this, you know, throughout these times of turnaround. Another element is safety. The drones can stroll around the facility to look for safety hazards. Perhaps, an employee accidentally left equipment behind, or service materials were not correctly left, etc. By monitoring the grounds, potential safety hazards can be reported in real time to supervisors in the control room, allowing them to ensure that safety is maximized for everyone on site. A final element related to turnaround time is that of the washout areas. Being able to tag the different components that are getting in and out and say exactly when they got in and where they were left once, they were washed properly, etc. - again, guaranteeing that plant work is being conducted as planned and nothing is getting lost. A logical question to ask – is it worth it? Well, there are two main drivers behind ROI and the first one is reduced costs. Being able to automate the labor intensive, lengthy manual inspection, translates directly into savings. The costs involved with manual inspection from insurance to special equipment to time spent by employees for doing the work can run hundreds of thousands of dollars. Of course, most companies inspect their facilities a few times a year, leading to an exorbitant amount of money needed for inspections. The second significant contributor to ROI is increased productivity/increased safety. By minimizing incidents and maximizing uptime, ensuring business continuity, companies gain greatly. Keeping employees safe helps to boost morale and improve production. This technology is truly capable of automating everything end to end and has proven its value. We at ADNOC have found the main benefit is simplifying the detection and control of unsafe acts and unsafe conditions in a dynamic and high risk work environment such as the maritime industry. Percepto helps us improve our company employees’ ability to remain safe, which in turn leads to a reduction in downtime and insurance costs. All this further enhances our reputation and protects ADNOC's brand name. It demonstrates collaboration, as well as motivation and encouragement of others to enhance or resolve occupational HSE issues in exhibiting the will and ability to intervene when required to stop unsafe actions and conditions.",['eyes']

It has been practiced for many centuries in the Indonesian community to maintain good health and for treatment (Elfahmi et al., 2008). Contract design in the jamu supply chain under uncertainty environment is one of the prospective solutions to answer the jamu supply chain challenges. Existing contracts have not been able to respond to these challenges. According to Schroeder et al. (2011), the adaptive term in contract means the contract systems are capable of adapting their behavior to changes in their environment. In order to make a contract in a supply chain system represent each entity/actor, we can use a virtual collaboration approach. Virtual collaboration follows the same process as collaboration, but the parties involved in virtual collaboration do not physically interact and communicate exclusively through technological channels (Sutanto et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2013; Ho et al., 2016) develop adaptive contract design for crowdsourcing market (Schroeder et al., 2011). This paper analyzes and designs a virtual collaboration information system based on fair adaptive contract for jamu supply chain in order to respond stability challenges (Arshinder et al., 2011) in a supply chain with uncertainty environment condition. 2. Methodology and result 2.1. The virtual collaboration information system analysis The requirement analysis of the virtual collaboration system based on fair adaptive contract is analyzed by system entity as the representation of the system (Wasson, 2015). System analysis is used to design a conceptual model of the system. The conceptual design is used to make the developer easier to understand behavior of the system. System analysis results are virtual collaboration adaptive information system requirement to develop the system based on fair adaptive contract. Because, the goal of system is generating fair adaptive contract the main variables and parameters in the system analysis in both quantity and quality, and the other variables that common in supply chain. There are also cost and time as the support variables. 2.2. Business process modeling, design use case, and sequence diagram In this research, Business Process Modelling Notation verse 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) is used to design the business process model. BPMN 2.0 is standard notation for business process modeling that widely applied by business analyst (Zur et al., 2013). The next step of conceptual modeling design is to design the actor’s role and their interaction/relationship in collaboration system by using use case diagram. Use case diagram is used to identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well (Almutairi et al., 2013). So, the higher-level view of the system is easier to understand. Then, sequence diagram is used to detail the sequence of each interaction in the system. Sequence diagrams are the most popular diagram for dynamic modeling, which focuses on identifying the behavior within the system (Greenyer et al., 2013). Table 1. System Analysis Result System Attributes Analysis Results Inputs All variables related to quality and quantity of products and raw materials including transportation aspect and cost Outputs All type of jamu products Process Jamu production Risks Seasonal, bulky, and perishable products Stakeholders Farmers, wholesalers, industry, SME Controls Control quality Resources Herbal material System goals Target quantity and quality The result of business process modeling is shown by Figure 1. Figure 1 is the main business process in virtual collaboration in the jamu supply chain. The two main processes are raw material entity and processing entity. Wholesaler inputs raw material data and the system sends it to the processor. The processor will check the demand forecasting, make a production, and purchasing planning. The “+” sign in the diagram describes the decomposed process. It means the process has detailed processes. Each process is detailed in the next diagram.

Design class diagram and database of the system Class diagram is an UML diagram type, describes the structure of a system by showing the system’s classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects (Herchi and Abdessalem, 2012). It is used both for general conceptual modeling of the systematics of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. The class diagram is used to model each sub system entity in virtual collaboration system and generate data model of the system. After data design is generated, a NoSQL (Not only SQL) database is designed by using Java Script Object Notation (JSON). The structure of this database is graph database form to represent virtual interaction in the system. Each entity in the system is modeled into class diagram. The class diagram of the system is shown in Figure 2. All processing and purchasing class require input raw material and sales of products. The relationship between actors is generated into graph data where data in an actor or entity send to other actor for collaboration purposes. We also generate the class diagram into object oriented java programming.

Opens in a new window.Figure 3.Example Graph Data of Virtual Collaboration System in Jamu Supply Chain 2.4. Problem formulation and mathematical modeling We describe the problem description into goal programming mathematical model. The goal programming represents multigoal decision approach of the system. Goal programming is a branch of multiobjective optimization, which in turn is a branch of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) (Romero, 2014). As satisfaction of the target is deemed to satisfy the decision maker(s), an underlying satisficing philosophy is assumed. According to the problem description the objective constraints for goal programming are (1) ∑i=1I∑j=1JXij+∑i=1I∑k=1KXik+d1−−d1+=Tqp (2) ∑s=1S∑j=1JMs→j+∑f=1F∑j=1JMf→j+d2−−d2+=Tqtp (3) ∑s=1S∑j=1JQs→jbb+∑f=1F∑j=1JQf→jbb+d3−−d3+=Tqqbb (4) ∑s=1S∑j=1JQi→jpp+∑f=1F∑j=1JQi→kpp+d4−−d4+=Tqqp Equation (1) is the goal of quantity product that is produced by industry and small medium enterprise (SME). It is defined by summation of product I produced by industry I and small medium enterprise k. The Equation (2) is the goal of quantity raw materials that are transported from farmers and(or) wholesaler into industry and(or) SME. It is defined by summation of total raw material from farmer f to industry j and summation of raw material from wholesaler s to industry j. The Equations (3) and (4) are goals to meet the quality of the raw material and product in order to fulfill customer request. It is summation of quality of the product i produced in industry j and SME k. And availability logistic transportation for transport raw material in Eq. (9) as follows (5) ∑s=1S∑j=1JMs→j+∑f=1F∑j=1JMf→j≤Tqtp Also the prediction of availability raw material with specific quality for production purpose as described by Eqs. (10) and (11) (6) ∑s=1S∑j=1JQbbQs→jbb+∑f=1F∑j=1JQbbQf→jbb≤TQqqbb (7) ∑s=1S∑j=1JQppQi→jpp+∑f=1F∑j=1JQppQi→kpp≤TQqqp We design contract value for quantity and quality for supply chain actor collaboration in partial approach by integrating backpropagation algorithm and then use goal approach as multicriterial decision approach. We generate data for simulation purposes follow the real case data trend for three adaptive fair contracts. According to the implementation of goal programming formulation and backpropagation algorithm with Neuroph API in java programming we got the estimated results from real case problem. We also present total quantity material and quality in the supply chain. We present the total cost for production and transportation. The result is obtained by integrating neural network and goal programming. We got neural network with input from quality and quantity of raw material and product for each supply chain actor. The training phase for two times running got neural network with hidden layer 17 and error 0.004198. Table 2. Result from the Example Case Run Variables (Total) Value in Contract 1 (First contract) Quantity material A 11.2 ton Quantity material B 10.9 ton Quantity material C 12.5 ton Quantity material D 12 ton Quality material A 98.6 % Quality material B 99.1 % Quality material C 98.2 % Quality material D 99.2 % Transportation cost Rp 14 500 100 Production cost Rp 102 900 000 3. Conclusion and future research In this paper, we design adaptive contract system in jamu supply chain using system analysis and design, goal programming formulation, and backpropagation neural network to predict the uncertainty variable in the system. According to the result our system can determine the variables value in contract system with three times running to design three contract according to the availability and quality of raw material and jamu product. Although our system is validated and verified as a system, this model is initial research in adaptive contract for agricultural supply chain that need to determine other aspects such as the performance of supply chain, government regulation, product logistic, and organization structural in contract system. We recommend the future research to expand this initial research into other aspects, hence the contract design is comprehensive in order to increase the supply chain system performance.

Guest Editorial: Pathways to Transforming Energy Demand in the Oil and Gas Sector,2025,"_ The energy world is rapidly changing. The pressure to address climate change, ensure reliable energy supplies, and manage costs is greater than ever. During this shift, the oil and gas industry, one of the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, has an opportunity to take the lead in transforming energy use. With its global resources and expertise, the sector could become a key player in making the energy transition sustainable and efficient. From a wider view, a new study from the World Economic Forum found that cutting energy use by 31% could save trillions of dollars each year while significantly reducing environmental harm. Oil and gas companies, given their scale and impact, are well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity, but it will require innovations both big and small along with incremental changes in day-to-day operations. One of the most effective ways to reduce energy demand is to focus on energy efficiency. This may mean implementing energy management systems across facilities to drive significant reductions in energy use. Chevron, for example, has saved millions of dollars by introducing energy management systems in its refineries that optimize energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such systems provide real-time data that allow companies to make informed decisions that save energy and cost and could similarly be applied to a variety of upstream facilities in the field. Technology advancements such as this one are crucial, but smaller changes can also have a big impact. For instance, reducing business travel in favor of virtual meetings can help companies reduce carbon emissions and operational costs. Digitalization and AI: The Future of Oil and Gas Digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) are already found throughout the oil and gas value chain and offer new ways to optimize operations and reduce energy consumption. AI can be used for predictive maintenance to help companies reduce downtime, extend machinery life, and eliminate unnecessary repairs. In addition, companies such as Shell are leveraging AI to monitor equipment in real time. Adopters claim the advanced software is preventing breakdowns and reducing the need for on-site maintenance, reducing the knock-on effect of increasing energy use from inefficient operations. Advanced monitoring and automation also allow for more tasks to be performed remotely, reducing the need for travel to isolated or offshore locations. The adoption of such solutions results in measurable energy savings, and for large-scale operations, even small operational shifts are quickly translated into meaningful gains. The Role of Hybrid Work in Sustainability The shift toward hybrid work is one of the most significant, yet often overlooked, incremental changes. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that many oil and gas workers could operate remotely without sacrificing productivity. Some companies, such as BP and Shell, have adopted hybrid work models where employees split time between the office and home. This approach reduces the need for commuting and cuts the energy demands of running large office spaces at full capacity. Companies can significantly lower their energy consumption and emissions with this hybrid model, which maximizes in-office time while allowing the convenience of remote work on predetermined days.","['guest', 'editorial:', 'pathways', 'transforming', 'energy', 'demand', 'sector']"
How do performance monitoring systems support sustainability in healthcare?,2025,"Purpose “Sustainability” in a health-care context is defined by the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015, and in particular the third SDG. Accordingly, this research summarizes seminal studies and draw on it to identify the waves of challenges affecting this sector. This study aims to contribute to the discourse on sustainability in health-care organizations (HCOs) by exploring the role of performance monitoring systems (PMS), such as the balanced scorecard (BSC). Design/methodology/approach To explore this issue further, the authors illustrate the transformation model of the HCOs, from inputs to outcomes. The authors rely on the systems and organizational analysis/behavior theories. They use a qualitative case study approach (the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Lebanon – AUBMC) to delve into the intricacies of PMS implementation in an HCO. Findings The authors’ findings underline the role of PMS in operationalizing sustainability within HCOs. By adopting a PMS, HCOs can facilitate the integration of environmental, social and economic factors into decision-making processes. HCOs can enhance their performance and create long-term value. Research limitations/implications Despite the important findings, this paper is not enough to “generalize” and “replicate” the results. However, this paper is able to highlight a road map for HCO’s managers. Furthermore, it does not take into account the impact of artificial intelligence on the design, implementation and analysis of the results produced by such a PMS. Practical implications This paper highlights the importance of strong leadership and a well-defined approach for HCOs to achieve sustainability. It highlights that sustainability is no longer just about reputation; sustainability can enhance organizational performance across various aspects. Leaders need to integrate sustainability into the organization’s mission, vision and values. Thus, implementing a PMS like the BSC is crucial. On the other hand, a focus on sustainability can attract and retain top talent who are increasingly concerned about environmental and social responsibility. Furthermore, sustainability efforts should consider patient needs. And finally, sustainability can drive innovation through developing new services, partnerships and technologies that reduce environmental impact and improve financial performance. Social implications This study highlights how adopting a sustainable approach in HCOs aligns with and supports achieving the UN-SDGs related to health care (SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages). The findings conclude on the HCO’s sustainability efforts to: improve access to quality care (by providing more efficient operations and resource allocation, potentially allowing HCOs to treat more patients and improve access to quality care − SDG 3.1, 3.8); encourage investments in preventative care programs and public health initiatives (by contributing to a healthier population and reducing treatment burdens − SDG 3.3, 3.4); support environmental responsibility (by reducing energy consumption and waste disposal in HCOs can lessen their environmental footprint and contribute to a healthier planet − SDG 3.9); focus on the employee well-being (by creating a more positive work environment with better air quality and potentially stress-reducing practices, potentially improving employee well-being − SDG 3.9); and innovate for better health care (sustainability can drive innovation in areas such as telemedicine, renewable energy sources for powering HCOs and developing environmentally friendly medical equipment − SDG 3.b). Originality/value This research contributes to the emerging field of sustainability in health care by providing empirical evidence of the role of PMS in achieving sustainability goals. The case study offers practical insights for HCOs seeking to improve their sustainability performance and highlights the potential of a PMS as a strategic management tool.","['performance', 'monitoring', 'systems', 'support', 'sustainability', 'healthcare?']"

The purpose of this study is to analyse the state and prospects of the digital transformation of agriculture. Methodology. The research materials and methods are an analytical overview of digital solutions, agroinnovations in crop production, based on the achievements of science and technology. Results. In the agricultural industry, geographically distributed subjects and objects participate in business processes: employees, agricultural machinery, living organisms, there are situations of risk and uncertainty. Thanks to modern scientific and technological progress, farmers, based on the use of digital innovations, are transforming agriculture into a high-tech industry. The article considers the essence of smart agriculture as a promising vector for the development of the agricultural sector. It was revealed that smart technologies (quantum technologies, augmented and virtual reality technologies, artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, In-ternet of things, etc.) radically affect the achievement of high productivity in the agricultural sphere. The use of domestic digital platforms initiated the creation and introduction of new modes of economic behavior of agricultural organizations. High-tech agriculture effectively addresses the current problems of food security and climate change. It was established that the digital transformation of the industry, the introduction of precision agriculture would provide an increase in crop yields, allow farmers to receive financial benefits, and reduce the burden on nature. The state of digitalization of precision agriculture in the Bryansk region was considered. By industrial production of potatoes, the region is the leader-rum in the Russian Federation, by rapeseed yield, the region is a world leader. The results in grain farming are high. Large enterprises of the region use satellite technologies in field processing, space monitoring of farmland is carried out, agricultural machinery is equipped with monitoring systems, sensors, etc. Reasons and factors have been identified that ""inhibit"" the introduction of digital technologies in the agricultural sector. Conclusion. High-tech solutions radically transform the agricultural sphere of the economy, contribute to the growth of labor productivity in the industry. The use of Russian digital platforms was shaping new models of economic behaviour among agricultural organizations. The digital transformation of the agricultural industry has positive both economic and indirect and social effects.","['state', 'prospects', 'digital', 'transformation', 'agriculture']"

Unwrapping the McDonald's model: An introduction to dynamic social theory,2023,"George Ritzer's famous McDonaldization thesis describes how principles used by this fast-food chain dominate many sectors of society. First published by the Journal of American Culture in 1983 in the article “The ‘McDonaldization’ of Society,” the thesis developed Max Weber's argument that bureaucracy and capitalism trap people in an “iron cage” (stahlhartes Gehäuse) of rationality. Ritzer showed how Max Weber's characteristics of rationalized systems—efficiency, predictability, calculability, the substitution of non-human for human technology, and control over uncertainty—are used in many areas of society, including the “predictability and uniformity of work on the “academic assembly line” (Ritzer, 1998, 49). Ritzer tells a good story about how corporate rationalization spread across the world, through “such disparate phenomena as fast food restaurants, TV dinners, package tours, industrial robots, plea bargaining, and open-heart surgery on an assembly-line basis” (Ritzer, 1983, 100). He correctly anticipated the beginning of a “process that promises even more extraordinary changes” (100). His 20th anniversary edition predicted the “most likely scenario is the continued expansion of the McDonaldization of society” (Ritzer, 2013, x). And so it proved. Since 1983, McDonald's has grown from fewer than 10,000 outlets to about 40,275 locations in over 100 markets by 2023, while its stock (share) price has risen from US$1.12 ($3.38 in 2023 values) to US$270.00 in March 2023, giving it a market capitalization of almost $200bn as the world's 46th most valuable company (Google Finance)—see Figure 1. However insightful, Ritzer's analysis does not enable people to solve social problems or improve society. If anything, it paralyzes people into believing McDonaldization is an unstoppable behemoth they are powerless to influence. In their controversial book, Usable Knowledge: Social Science and Social Problem Solving, Charles Lindblom and David Cohen lamented “the relatively thoughtless wastefulness” of much social research that is “a positive obstruction to social problem solving” (Lindblom & Cohen, 1979, 86). The eminent sociologist Jonathan Turner observed that research “has become increasingly an end in itself without reference to the accumulation of knowledge or to the theoretical cumulation that comes with systematic tests of theories” (Turner, 2001, 10). Five years later, in The Production of Knowledge: The Challenge of Social Science Research, William Starbuck observed that “Hundreds of thousands of talented researchers are producing little of lasting value” because they are focused on producing journal articles rather than knowledge (2006, 5; 142). This futility is compounded by the inability to replicate many social science experiments, and the fact that papers on non-replicable findings are cited more than replicable ones (Serra-Garcia & Gneezy, 2021). The problem is that the “academic assembly line” criticized by Ritzer creates a culture of social science that separates research from social practice, reducing impact (Bastow et al., 2014, 54; 100–4). It does not have to be like this. Social sciences offer many insightful methods and findings to improve society. In How Social Science Got Better Max Grossman says, “social science will play an important part in the human future,” though it “can make no claim from its own studies that its insights will be usefully incorporated into public opinion or governance” (Grossman, 2021, 250-1). For their insights to be used, social scientists need to help people use knowledge better, as advocated by Chris Argyris et al. through “Action Science” (1985). Lindblom and Cohen point out that “Much of the world's work of problem solving is accomplished not through PSI [professional social inquiry] but through ordinary knowledge, through social learning, and through interactive problem solving” (Lindblom & Cohen, 1979, 91). This essay addresses the challenge posed by Ritzer's conclusion— “What is needed is not a less rational society, but greater control over the process of rationalization involving, among other things, efforts to ameliorate its irrational consequences” (1983, 107)—by showing how social research can empower people to improve society by working on institutions as social models, equivalent to theories in the physical sciences. To show how people can be empowered, social scientists can learn from one sector that actively uses social research to transform the world—business. Like Ritzer, this paper uses McDonald's to illustrate a thesis, which is that institutions are everyday social experiments that embody knowledge about how to do things in society. An institution may be defined as any pattern of behavior that continues over time. This is a simpler definition than most, closer to new institutionalism (Lowndes & Roberts, 2013). It is closest to Samuel Huntington's definition of institutions as “stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior” (1973, 12). This definition is consistent with Hodgson's “systems of rules that structure social interactions” where “rules include norms of behaviour and social conventions” (Hodgson, 2015, 501). It covers the wide range of recurring patterns of behavior instituted by people to meet perceived needs, from social norms to global governance. Large institutions are made up of countless smaller units, each of which is a mini-institution. These in turn contain micro-institutions—the rituals, routines, rules, and norms that make it work. Every institution is a social model, which is replicated, imitated, or modified to produce a range of social outcomes. A social model is never static yet embodies behaviors and knowledge that may persist for generations. It may be seen as a “dynamic social theory” which is tested and developed in reality every day. Most institutions have more complex aims than McDonald's, but it provides a useful illustration of general principles. McDonald's has ancient antecedents. The institution of fast food can be traced from the dawn of civilization (Freedman, 2007; Higman, 2011). Ancient Greeks described the Egyptian custom of frying and selling fish in the streets of the port city of Alexandria. The custom spread across the Roman world and developed numerous variations to meet the needs of different communities, climates, and cultures. Excavations at Pompeii show well-preserved remains of thermopolia (Latin for “places where hot is sold”), forerunners of McDonald's. Over the centuries people have imitated, modified, replicated, and reinvented models of how to provide food fast and earn a living. The McDonald brothers entered the fast food business in 1937 after they observed the success of a hot dog cart across the street from where they worked. Their model has been replicated, refined, and reformulated since 1940, from one burger restaurant in San Bernardino, California, to their “Speedee Service System” and first franchise in 1952, burgeoning to over 40,275 restaurants worldwide in 2022 (Statista Research Department, 2023), second in size only to Subway's 42,998 outlets (Chepekmoi, 2019). The model includes rigorous processes to review and renew both its internal operations and external relationships to produce broadly predictable outcomes. Like a theory in the natural sciences, McDonald's is a replicable model of an aspect of reality that enables many people to achieve specific outcomes—meals, celebrations, employment, identity, returns on investment, status, et cetera. The McDonald's formula includes carefully calibrated actions to ensure consistent outcomes across continents (see, for example, Daszkowski, 2019). Just as space travel depends on the laws of physics being the same everywhere, McDonald's relies on consistency across the many regimes where it operates, including sufficient consumer demand, individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources to run a franchise, reliable supply chains, a robust legal framework, and a regulatory environment. Lindblom and Cohen suggested that policy frameworks which make this stability possible are equivalent to Thomas Kuhn's paradigms in natural science (Lindblom & Cohen, 1979, 77). Despite wide differences between China, India, and the USA, the commercial environments of these countries are sufficiently similar for the McDonald's model to flourish. Although the core outputs (cheap fast food) have stayed relatively consistent over time, the model itself has changed substantially in response to changes in competition, culture, accounting, environmental concerns, investments, laws, labor conditions, and social norms, as well as internal innovation. As a result, many aspects are very different from 1952. McDonald's now offers halal, vegetarian, and even vegan options. It fulfills different social functions in different locations, from the grab-and-go drive-through in America to places where people hang out with friends in Taiwan. It advertises through social media more than billboards. It is owned by corporate investors rather than two brothers. But it would disappear entirely if it failed to adapt. So long as McDonald's delivers outcomes people want and is financially successful, its evolving model will be widely studied by business students, entrepreneurs, and investors as well as critics (Battye, 2018; Gregory, 2017; Profitworks, n.d.; Smart, 1999; Thompson, 2022). Closer analysis shows how the distinct layers of knowledge embodied in McDonald's contribute to its cultural and economic power. Understanding these layers can help citizens and social scientists to produce outcomes more important than burgers. But first, it is worth considering why an institution can be seen as equivalent to a theory in the natural sciences. Theories are models of reality based on analysis of evidence. Good scientific models enable people to achieve predictable outcomes, generate new knowledge, and unlock the power of nature. Social sciences have no equivalent method of modeling social reality to unlock the potential of human societies. Indeed, the very concept of theory in social and political sciences is contested. In his Handbook of Sociological Theory, Turner observed “there is no consensus over how sociology should proceed to explain the social world.” It has “what can only be described as hyperdifferentiation of theories,” each of which “has a resource base of adherents, a place in academia, and a series of outlets for scholarly publications” (Turner, 2006, 1). It is hard for social science to give us theoretical models of reality that can be consistently relied on because society is constantly changing and the theories themselves influence people's behavior. The nearest thing to a reliable model of how to do things in society is an institution, a pattern of behavior repeated over time, replicated in different contexts, which creates and incorporates new knowledge to meet changing circumstances. A synagogue, school, or street market is recognizable across centuries, countries, and cultures. Each institution embodies knowledge of how to achieve relatively consistent outcomes over time, while adapting to shifting power relations and external conditions. Institutional models are scaled up, refined, and replicated to provide similar functions in many different societies, or adapted to achieve different outcomes. Institutional behaviors and structures are more persistent than the beliefs which guide them, as can be seen, for example, in continuities of form and function from ancient temples through synagogues, churches, and mosques to the secular Sunday Assembly. Each institution is a unique embodiment of how to achieve specific outcomes in a particular time and place. The institution may not be the best “theory” (most aren't), but it can be improved or superseded if people do things differently or want different outcomes. Each institution is tested daily by social reality—a process that is rarely rigorous or scientific—but it is possible to use rigorous methods and science to continuously improve outcomes. Any long-standing institution therefore represents a “cumulation that comes with systematic tests” as sought by Turner (1989), with the best of their kind representing the most advanced theory. The idea that institutions embody theories recalls Karl Popper's observation that “organic structures are theory-incorporating as well as problem-solving structures.” He wrote “practical problems arise because something has gone wrong, because of some unexpected event. But this means that the organism, whether man or amoeba, has previously adjusted itself (perhaps ineptly) to its environment, by evolving some expectation, or some other structure (say, an organ). Yet such an adjustment is the preconscious form of developing a theory; and since any practical problem arises relative to some adjustment of this kind, practical problems are, essentially, imbued with theories” (Popper, 1976, 133). Institutions are natural experiments, learning in response to problems and opportunities, imbued with everyday knowledge and preconscious theories about how to solve problems. They are also purposeful, striving to survive, multiply and flourish in their social environment. An institution like McDonald's is imbued with theories about food, customer service, marketing, supply chains, finance, and much else. Its leaders and staff constantly work on many different levels to get the outcomes they want. By seeing institutions like McDonald's as the equivalent of theories in the natural sciences, social scientists can help people unlock the power of society to shape the future and, as Ritzer hoped, ameliorate their irrational consequences. The following section aims to unwrap the many levels of analysis involved in McDonald's as a social model. Every McDonald's outlet embodies extensive knowledge about how to sell fast food at scale, taught in-store, at eight McDonald's Hamburger University campuses, and in business schools throughout the world. The mission of Hamburger University is to become an “organizational culture hub, introducing a continuous education process for the value chain and transforming knowledge into actual business results” according to their website (University of the People, n.d.). Over 2000 h of training focus on leadership development, business growth, operations, and McDonald's core values. However, McDonald's staff are not the only people involved: customers, investors, regulators, politicians, commentators, and critics can all influence the business. Unwrapping the McDonald's example shows at least nine layers of analysis used by people to influence the outcomes of a social model. Social scientists can help people understand and use all layers of analysis to help people achieve better outcomes from institutions: Each McDonald's outlet is a unique real-time model that includes the experiences, emotions, aspirations, and beliefs of people involved, as well as the knowledge, skills, processes, routines, and relationships that make it work. The McDonald's company itself is a high-level real-time model that spans the globe, using sophisticated systems of governance, finance, organization, and training as well as human relationships to achieve business results. It has a clear purpose that informs the actions of its leaders, staff, and other stakeholders. They in turn have multiple purposes, such as employment, return on investment, or a quick meal, which McDonald's leaders seek to align with their core purposes. Real-time models can continue for decades, or even millennia, transmitting patterns of behavior, methods, and knowledge across generations. Shops, street food sellers, and inns are almost universal ancient institutions, but each one is also unique and capable of development. People modify their model to create many different kinds of shops, inns, and street food vendors. People experiment, adapting to changing conditions and beliefs. They create new social models within existing institutions to meet changing needs. For example, an inn in 13th-century Bruges, owned by the Van der Beurze family, became a meeting place for traders that was institutionalized in 1409 as the “Brugse Beurse.” It rapidly became a model for the world's first stock exchanges and a foundation of the emerging capitalist economic system (Murray, 2005). Similarly, in the late 1600s, Edward Lloyd's coffee house in London became a meeting place for merchants to insure their cargoes and ships, from which today's multi-billion insurance market grew (Marcus, 1975, 193). Across the world people are inventing new models that could transform society, just as the institutions of capitalism emerged from medieval Europe. The internet enables people to create entirely new models of shops, such as eBay, Amazon, and the global ecommerce platform Shopify, as well as new models of social relationships and politics. Ahuvia et al. suggested “eBayization” as a counter trend to McDonaldization (2011). A real-time model may appear to be an “iron cage” of rationality as observed by Weber and Ritzer, but there is always scope to adapt or challenge customary ways of doing things. Toyota, for example, has a different institutional logic based on systems thinking, which involves close attention to the gemba, Japanese for the “place where action happens.”. The Toyota model encourages continuous improvement through employee contributions, quality circles, problems solving, and solution-focused questions by managers on regular “gemba walks” (Dalton, 2019). The highly effective Buurtzorg model of social care in the Netherlands is a radical alternative to bureaucratic public services, enabling nurses to work in small, non-hierarchical, self-managing teams with functional support to provide a wide range of personal, social, and clinical care to clients with no oversight or direction (Buurtzorg, 2023). Cooperatives offer alternative models to capitalist enterprise, employing more than 280 million people in over three million cooperatives across the globe (International Cooperative Alliance). Each real-time model is an experiment, integrating everyday knowledge with layers of specialized knowledge of how to achieve specific results in a particular time and place. For simplicity, these different kinds of knowledge can be separated into nine or more layers of analysis (see Figure 2). Professional social inquiry, such as sociology, is only one of these and often the least influential or useful in practice. The following sections outline these layers as exemplified by McDonald's. Physical models are the material structures of institutions. Early on, the McDonald brothers closed their restaurant and got their team to draw their ideal kitchen layout in chalk on a tennis court floor. Team members took their places on the full-size kitchen layout to simulate the processes of making burgers, fries, and shakes. They tried different layouts, identifying and solving problems until the team came up with a layout that supported flow. McDonald's staff design every detail of the location, building, billboards, counters, kitchens, utensils, and eating areas of each outlet to achieve the outlet's objectives. Its physical organization embodies specialized knowledge of how to deliver food, just as thermopolia did in the Roman empire. People shape their environment through behavior, creating pathways, tools, and the physical basis of society. Our ancestors created roads, fields, cities, and other infrastructure to achieve their aims, laying foundations for the modern world. Contemporary societies embed knowledge in electric circuits to create computers, the internet, Wi-Fi, and satellites to pursue social purposes. Organizing the flow of electrons and radio waves is the same process as canalizing water and building highways—using knowledge to build physical models that service society. Infrastructures create both possibilities and constraints, so that the physical embodiments of collective knowledge become powerful drivers of social outcomes (Cass et al., 2018; Latham & Layton, 2019; Star, 1999). But physical models can also be changed, as McDonald's did when designing drive-through outlets and self-service screens. Normative models are the templates, formulae, methods, mantras, checklists (Gawande, 2009), codes, and plans used to guide the replication of real-time models, such as the McDonald's franchisee process, staff handbooks, training manuals, and strategic plans as well as informal rules of thumb (“Your First Steps on Your U.S. Franchisee Journey,” mcdonalds.com). These are often based on best practice in real-time models. Sometimes they introduce new procedures, processes, or strategies. Normative models are not always reliable. They may be out-of-date, inaccurate, or deliberately misleading. An institution may survive by bribing officials, cheating users, and other forbidden activities that do not appear in any handbook but are established norms through organizational culture. Normative models have a significant role in replicating and improving outcomes of real-time models. Changing a procedure, developing new norms, creating a checklist, or regulating aspects of an institution can have large-scale, long-term impact on outcomes that social research can help to improve. Values are the “know why” of institutions and individuals, expressing purpose and aspirations. McDonald's stated values have evolved in response to customer expectations and industry trends. In the early days they were simply speed and efficiency, embodied by its famous “Speedee Service System.” From the 1970s its core values were “service, quality, and cleanliness” as the company strove for consistency across outlets. From the late 1990s McDonald's increased emphasis on corporate responsibility, sustainability and, more recently, health. It now says, “Our mission is to make delicious feel-good moments easy for everyone,” with commitment to “core values that define who we are and how we run our business and restaurants: Serve · Inclusion · Integrity · Community · Family” (“Who We Are,” mcdonalds.com). Throughout its history it has also been driven by values of ambition, competitiveness, and profitability. Values are powerful drivers of behavior, inspiring people to achieve extraordinary feats, or commit terrible deeds. Like norms, actual values may be very different from those professed. People often have inconsistent and unconscious values, but when individual and institutional values are aligned, they can achieve remarkable things. Generic models: The McDonald's business model is studied by aspiring entrepreneurs across the world. McDonald's leaders also monitor generic models of their competitors and business areas such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG), logistics, and technology, to inform their strategy. Business models are an essential tool in commerce, for which there are numerous templates as well as an extensive literature (e.g., Fielt, 2011; Ghezzi, 2020; Weill et al., 2005). Generic models are less developed in other areas, so business is often the default template. For a discussion of models in the public sector, see Lane (2000) or Osborne et al. (2014). Non-profits use Theories of Change, social marketing, community organizing, or ad hoc models (Brennan et al., 2014; Brest, 2010; Wendt, 2021). People often draw generic lessons from institutions in one area of society to another, as described by Ritzer. Political strategists draw lessons from successful election campaigns, religious evangelists use models from marketing and show business, and many social scientists model their work on natural sciences. The arts, armies, governments, universities, and most areas of life use generic models to inform their work. Good generic models increase people's ability to shape society. Studying these takes us to a sixth layer of analysis. Stories: In 2020 McDonald's spent about US$650 million on advertising to tell positive stories about its products (Faria, 2023). Slogans like “You deserve a break today” (1971) and “I'm lovin’ it” (2003), are micro narratives in which the customer is the hero and McDonald's the reward. Toys and characters like Ronald McDonald make McDonald's memorable for children. Stories about staff and franchisees make them feel valued and part of something bigger (“Our Stories,” mcdonalds.com). All these narratives contribute to a brand value of almost US$200 billion in 2022 (Faria, 2023), almost three times the value of McDonald's physical assets. Brand value is a cultural artifact as well as a powerful factor in the economy (Gershon, 2014). Critics tell counter-narratives, such as Ritzer's McDonaldization (1993), Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation (2001), and Morgan Spurlock's docu-commentary Super Size Me (2004), but these appear not to have affected McDonald's relentless growth and rising share price, which accelerated after 2004. Stories tap into people's emotion, conveying notions of identity, agency, and belonging. They are also an essential tool of organizational development. Leaders distill essential knowledge into stories for different purposes, about how to treat customers, economic trends, their business model, economic or political analysis. Successful organizations have champions who tell stories that promote a sense of belonging among members and attract new supporters. Models with effective champions and good stories spread more widely than examples that lack champions and stories. Social scientists have long studied and understood the nature of stories (e.g., Czarniawska, 2004; Gabriel, 2000; Gelman & Basbøll, 2014). The lesson is that social scientists need to tell stories about research findings to help people create better practice and improve social models. These nine layers outline some of the many forms of knowledge people use to understand, influence, or run any institution, whether McDonald's, a university or government. Institutions can be analyzed in many other ways, such as Max Weber's theory of bureaucratic rationality. Williamson's New Institutional Economics describes four levels of analysis (norms, formal rules, governance structures, and resources allocation) based on the timescales involved in changing each level (Williamson, 2000). Institutions can also be analyzed in terms of hierarchy, roles, and distribution of power, which vary widely between cultures, or in terms of scale, from micro to macro. The method depends on the purpose of the analysis. My aim is to highlight the different types of analysis used in real-time models, each of which contributes to the collective knowledge embedded in any institution to bring about its outcomes. Like many businesses, these are explicit and prescriptive in McDonald's, but all nine layers are at least implicit in every institution. Social scientists can help people to improve society by consciously working on different layers wrapped up in a real-time model, to develop it as a dynamic social theory of how to bring about specific outcomes. At their pinnacle are artifacts of culture, the stories and symbols people use to replicate or change institutions. McDonald's wraps all nine layers of analysis within each real-time outlet under its control, integrating a wide range of knowledge into everyday actions to achieve its objectives and replicate or reinvent itself. Lessons from centuries of experience, the latest research, and daily data are embedded through symbols, storytelling, procedures, and physical infrastructure, alongside methods to ensure the model survives and continues to evolve. Conceptual models are only one dimension of our knowledge about society. They can inform real-time institutions, but are a snapshot in time, like an organizational chart that gradually ceases to be relevant. Because people are creative and have agency, real-time models acquire features that are not in any current analysis or abstract theory, like the traders meeting at the Beurse inn or Lloyd's coffee house. Observing how real-time models generate new possibilities will increase people's ability to shape their world. This is what makes them “dynamic social theories.” A customer or cook from ancient Rome would recognize McDonald's as a modern thermopolium, serving hot food fast. “Thermopolization” could be described as a culture of craft cooking, dependent on slaves in fields and kitchens. People changed this real-time model over millennia, but its modern successors perform the same basic functions for more people, on a larger scale, with greater consistency and less labor-time, generating a financial surplus that contributes to wages, taxes, pension funds, and shareholders. McDonald's is just one of many models of how to provide food, from home cooking, canteens, and soup kitchens to fine dining. All models can be seen as living experiments and working hypotheses (dynamic social theories), tested in practice and replicated to meet a need, belief, or policy. Although McDonald's is a simple institution compared with schools, hospitals, and governments, it is a highly sophisticated model of how to reproduce reliable results in many different cultures and contexts. No contemporary theory of Roman society could have predicted its future or determined what would happen over a long period. Yet today, people still replicate and refine Roman institutions that underpin our modern world. Legal systems, road networks, cities, states, and the Catholic church all use patterns of behavior and embedded knowledge from Roman times or earlier. Working on the layers of knowledge wrapped up in real-time models gives people greater ability to shape their social world. Abstract theories and conceptual models (the sixth layer of analysis) may be useful, but not necessarily more influential than any other layer. Over time people develop new models that replace the old, just as farming superseded hunter-gathering, money supplanted barter, and courts of law replaced trial by ordeal. McDonald's everyday experiments could lead to a radically different business model in the future. Artificial intelligence, facial recognition, drones, robots, and driverless vehicles could remix McDonald's in unpredictable ways. The eatery could become fully automated with no frontline staff (Ha, 2019). Alternatively, changes in culture, leadership and regulations could transform it into an employee-owned enterprise, serving only vegan meals. What will happen depends on social conditions, commercial success, the decisions people make individually and collectively, and the stories they tell. Current models of social sciences will have as little influence on McDonald's as Ritzer's thesis. People transform business models all the time to meet changing needs and conditions. Thus, a manufacturer of looms now produces cars (Toyota), a paper mill became a telecom giant (Nokia), or an online student directory became Facebook. Throughout the world, people are transforming schools, health services, states, and other entities, bending Weber's iron cage to create more responsive, humane institutions. Many of today's social science theories will be superseded, but people will continue to develop layers of knowledge embedded in institutions to meet their needs and desires. Social scientists can help create a future that is better for everyone by working with citizens and practitioners to improve social models across all areas of society, just as leaders of McDonald's use research to develop their model for selling meals. Improve social models: McDonald's leaders seek the most effective models for financing, franchising, logistics, marketing, training, food preparation, public relations, and other activities. Five questions can help social scientists develop institutional models to bring about specific social purposes in any area: Just as business students and entrepreneurs use successful business models to achieve commercial objectives, social researchers, and practitioners can study successful “dynamic theories” and disseminate what works. There are justifiable critiques of how “what works” has been used (Biesta, 2007), but practitioners and policy makers can still learn from centers1 and scholars that share smart practice in different sectors (Bardach, 2000; Bretschneider et al., 2004; Veselý, 2011). Scholars such as Acemoglu and Robinson (2012, 2019), Mazzucato (2011, 2022), and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, work closely with institutions to create better models of social research. Tell better stories: McDonald's spends about US$650 million a year to promote beef in a bun by telling stories through adverts, characters, and toys. Social sciences spend little on dissemination, often preferring the rewards of academic publication, citation, and a career to impact in the world. However, a growing number of scholars are entering the public sphere to tell stories based on research and engage in public debate through social media. Stories spread behaviors, beliefs, and forms of organization. They are often based on models of behavior, such as the acts of Jesus, hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad, Marx's narratives about the Paris Commune and immiseration under nineteenth-century capitalism, or party manifestos promising to replicate successful policies from elsewhere. Ritzer's McDonaldization thesis and McDonald's model as taught in business schools are both stories about the same company, but the first offers little to empower people while the latter promises a pathway to riches. No wonder business studies became our most successful social science while sociology declined. Social sciences offer many constructive solutions for improving education, preventing crime, reducing poverty, strengthening democracy, and improving the human condition. Communicating solutions to social problems through models of practice and stories are essential for a more effective model of social science. McDonald's is a highly successful model of how to produce and sell cheap meals fast, which has been adopted and adapted by many other organizations. People developed models of how to provide fast food over millennia, from fried fish in the streets of ancient Alexandria to Filet-o-Fish under the Golden Arches. Unwrapping McDonald's reveals nine layers of social knowledge that help people replicate and improve its outcomes. Real-time social models can be seen as “dynamic social theories” that integrate knowledge and experience from all levels, including physical infrastructure, operational templates, values, heuristic methods, generic models, conceptual theories, stories, and symbols. Storytelling has a key role, conveying a sense of identity, belonging, purpose, and values as well as emotion, knowledge, and wider cultural connections. People develop social models (institutions)—or invent new ones—to meet changing circumstances, needs, and aspirations, changing society in the process. Treating institutions as “dynamic social theories” embodying knowledge of how to do things in society will enable social researchers to help people create institutions that are better at solving social problems and meeting people's needs, just as the natural sciences use theories to help people solve problems in the material world. We can transform Weber's iron cage into institutions that free humanity from exploitation and oppression. We can learn from models other than McDonald's, like Buurtzorg, the cooperative movement, Toyota, and other social experiments, to create societies that work better for everyone. A more engaged model of social science would transform the world, not to mention the role and status of social science itself.

ACCC Survey Stresses Workforce Challenges &amp; Solutions,2023,"Association of Community Cancer Centers: Association of Community Cancer CentersThe Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) released its annual “Trending Now in Cancer Care Delivery” survey to highlight key areas facing today's oncologists and cancer care staff. The report is based on a series of facilitated interactive discussions with providers and industry members at the ACCC 49th Annual Meeting & Cancer Business Summit. The new survey covers eight key areas: workforce issues; need for empowering patients; dealing with payers; new care delivery models; tools to streamline clinic workflow; use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance cancer care; strategies to bring more diversity to clinical trials; and new methods to spur the adoption of precision medicine. The ACCC survey suggests solutions to deal with challenges and improve the delivery of high-quality cancer care in the community setting. This year's report “reinforces that we have no shortage of creative solutions to many challenges in cancer care delivery,” said ACCC President Olalekan Ajayi, PharmD, MBA. “Now we must take these proposed solutions and put them into action in cancer programs across the country.” Recruitment & Retention The trends survey states that most cancer programs are currently facing workplace shortages, and cancer center leadership needs to improve recruitment and retention and deal with staff burnout, increase resiliency, and improve morale. The survey makes the point that professional literature documents the fact that most people leave an organization because of its leadership. Therefore, for cancer programs with fewer resources, the following low-cost solutions were mentioned: begin meetings with a moment of gratitude and regularly ask staff to share why they work in oncology; create time for leaders to meet regularly with each staff member and ask about job satisfaction; regularly survey staff about what would make them feel more connected to their team members and the cancer program; structure ongoing recognition, which can be as simple as an extra day of paid time off (PTO) or an employee appreciation day; and meet regularly and individually with every physician to understand what each needs. Addressing Staff Shortages For cancer programs with more resources, the new survey recommends hiring additional advanced practice providers, medical assistants, and pharmacists to help with physician shortages and coverage gaps. The survey noted that embedded pharmacists can help with chemotherapy orders, patient education, and side effect/symptom management. The survey also recommends the following: hiring locum tenens during physician shortages to help with recruitment; developing a pool of floating advanced practice providers and locum tenens (e.g., retired physicians) to fill in at clinic locations so physicians can take vacations and come back to manageable patient schedules; leveraging other team members to make it easier for physicians, such as a clinical trial coordinator to handle administrative paperwork, a financial navigator, or a social worker to help with patient distress and social needs; using technology to collect data on physician workload to make informed decisions about resource allocation; and improving access to mental health services, such as partnering with an organization to offer therapy sessions. Other strategies to improve workforce challenges include the following: create funding streams to build in percentages of time that staff can devote to programs and processes that address burnout and build resiliency to burnout; partner with patient advocacy and community health workers who can help with patients' social determinants of health and barriers to care; educate payers about new oncology drugs coming to market, their major benefits, and their costs; and establish a single point of contact, generally a nonclinical staff member, to oversee the molecular testing process from start to finish. New Clinician Support Tools The ACCC 2023 trends survey explores AI-enabled clinician support tools, noting that AI can help cancer programs by generating revenue, improving workflows and processes, and recruiting talent. As one survey participant said, “Artificial intelligence has infiltrated our lives whether we're aware of it or not. And if you're not aware of this technology, you're already behind.” Another said, “The oncology program of the future may have an AI assistant for every practicing physician to support operations and allow physicians to spend more time with patients.” The trends survey states that AI can help decrease burnout when providers train AI to take over and complete certain tasks. An example is robotic process automation, a term for a process that automates manual, repetitive tasks through the use of software robots. The survey notes that successful process automation follows four steps: defining the process that can be automated and the desired outcome; designing the automation through an implementation plan; testing the automation; and deploying the automation by putting it into production and monitoring its performance. As stated in the survey, “Today's oncology programs and practices are using robotic process automation to do patient registration, complete prior authorizations, streamline workflows, code and bill for services, and accomplish claims adjudication.” The ACCC trends survey also addresses important issues related to AI and health equity. As previously reported by Oncology Times, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recently issued new recommendations for screening and addressing health-related social needs of cancer patients. On the ACCC survey, 51 percent of physicians said they have little or no time or ability to address their patients' social drivers of health. While 87 percent want greater time to address these social issues, 83 percent said that doing so would contribute to burnout. The ACCC survey notes that AI can help in this: “Prescriptive analytics programs can collect large amounts of data on social drivers of health and combine AI algorithms with machine learning techniques to identify at-risk patients (i.e., those with a higher chance of experiencing poor outcomes).” The ACCC survey also cites several commercially available prescriptive analytic programs that can be used for this purpose, noting that in 2021, the Small Business Innovation Research Program of the National Cancer Institute solicited proposals for the development of oncology-specific software to address social determinants of health in oncology practices. Payment Methods The 2023 ACCC survey also covers issues relating to alternative payment models. One of these is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM), a voluntary payment model that went into effect on July 1, 2023. Key differences between this model and its predecessor, the Oncology Care Model, include the following: the EOM is limited to seven cancer types (i.e., breast, colon, chronic leukemia, lung, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and prostate); a $70 Monthly Enhanced Oncology Services payment per enrolled patient (down from $160) plus $30 for dual-eligible; required use of health-related social needs screening and gradual implementation of electronic patient-reported health outcomes; required health equity assessment and plan; updated risk-adjustment model; and mandatory two-sided risk. The ACCC has developed an online Alternative Payment Model Implementation Checklist. Tips for cancer centers to prepare for an alternative model include the following, as presented in the ACCC 2023 trends survey: Know the specificity of included populations and covered services. Identify if there is a good flow of patient attribution. Make sure the episode of care you are going to be responsible for is well-defined. Consider information exchange, including data and reporting responsibilities. Understand your performance measures and benchmarks. Look at risk adjustment. Understand two-sided risk mitigation. Demonstrate the ability to generate shared savings before taking risk. Establish stop loss and risk corridors. Include adjustment of shared loss if there is an excellent quality performance.

Design and Implementation of SCADA Wireless Communication System for Monitoring the Performance of Microhydro Power Plant Based on Protocol AX.25,2018,"Abstract Purpose – This study aims to design and build a wireless supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system based on Protocol AX.25 with the aim of monitoring the performance of several parameters in Microhydro Power Plant (MHPP). This system can monitor several MHPP parameters such as voltage, current, frequency, and turbine rotation so that it can be accessed directly at one central location.Design/Methodology/Approach – The design is done by taking into account the real parameters that exist in the MHPP. Some parameters that become the main object to see the performance of MHPP are voltage, current, frequency, and turbine rotation. The voltage generated by the MHPP must be adjusted to the voltage supplied by State Electricity Company to the consumer, including the phase used. The resulting stream should also be monitored for power to be adjusted to the turbine spin. The generator frequency is kept stable according to the standard frequency of the State Electricity Company generator.Findings – The remote terminal unit (RTU) system has been simulated using 2 ACS712 current sensors, voltage sensor, zero crossing point, frequency sensor, and rotation sensor functionalized to monitor MHPP parameters. The AX.25 protocol has been applicable in the wireless SCADA network for monitoring the performance of MHPP by embedding in KYL-1020UA transceiver radio using the 433 MHz frequency and the audio frequency shift keying modulation system. Radio transmitter KYL-1020UA has been successfully simulated to send data from sensors to display on the computer through SCADA built applications.

Introduction Monitoring of the performance of the microhydro power plant (MHPP) system is carried out directly at the plant site. Conventional monitoring system is ineffective if there are many MHPP that are to be monitored and controlled centrally and located in remote areas. This research has designed a system to monitor MHPP wirelessly by utilizing AX.25 communication protocol. Some MHPP parameters such as turbine rotation, voltage, frequency, and current can be accessed directly at one central location using this system. The data transmitted by the sensors contained in the remote terminal unit (RTU) can be a guide for the operator to decide on further steps if any monitored MHPP parameters change from a predetermined standard. The objective of the research is to design the model wireless monitoring system based on protocol AX.25 with the aim of monitoring MHPP performance. 2. Literature review 2.1. Protocol AX.25 The AX.25 protocol is a protocol for synchronous network access between data terminal equipment (DTE) on the user side and data circuit terminating equipment which is a device located on the network side directly related to the user side (Zieliński, 2013). Protocol AX.25 has three layers that have different functions. The first layer, namely, physical level that will be related to the problem of the procedure of interaction with the modem physical media. While in practical terms it deals with the electrical and mechanical problems of the interface with an intermediate medium. One example of a technical specification about this layer is the connector (Ronan et al., 2010). This connector connects directly between the computer and the modem and consists of several pins that pass data of different functions. Figure 1 shows an example of multiple links to the radio port. The link multiplexer described in this standard multiplexes multiple data-link connections into one physical connection. Opens in a new window.Figure 1.AX.25 Model for Multiple Link 2.2. Microhydro power plant The MHPP principally exploits the height difference and the amount of water discharge per second in the irrigation channel, river, or waterfall. This water flow will rotate the turbine shaft to produce mechanical energy (Sobhan, 2016). This energy then drives the generator and generates electricity. 2.3. SCADA Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a system that collects data from various sensors in remote locations and then sends this data to a central computer which then manages and controls the data. Due to the increasing scope of its use, the use of these communication lines became impractical, as it introduced an integrated wireless communication system for SCADA (Kim, 2010; Bardzadeh et al., 2012; Daniel et al., 2014). Specifically SCADA systems include several parts of them, operating equipment such as pumps, valves, conveyors, and branch breakers that can be controlled by actuators or relays. Instruments in the field or facilities that are sensitive to conditions such as pH, temperature, pressure, power level and flow rate.Then a close-range communication network between a local processor with instruments and equipment operation. This section includes Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) and Process Automation Controller (PAC).(Rosslin and Kim, 2010). 2.4. Terminal node controller Terminal Node Controller (TNC) is a microprocessor-based device that is often used in data communications on an amateur radio package network. The main function of TNC is to establish a connection between the radiofrequency (RF) transceiver and a computer that serves the device as a DTE such as a programmable logic controller or weather station. The TNC function consists of assembling and disassembling the frame and modulation and demodulation to adjust the format of the data transmitted through the computer serial port according to the requirements of the wireless transmission line (Ronan, et.al., 2010; Zieliński, 2013). 3. Research and design method The design of SCADA wireless communication system based on protocol AX.25 for monitoring of MHPP in general has several stages, namely: Design stage by considering the real condition in the field: monitored parameters and monitoring method already exist. The results of this monitoring serve as a basis in designing hardware on the part of RTU that serves to acquire, collect, and mengrim existing data on the generator, then the main terminal unit (MTU) that serves to receive, demodulate, and decode data Sent RTU to be displayed on the SCADA graphic user interface (GUI). Preparation of simulation software: this stage aims to produce a simulation model of MHPP performance monitoring system wirelessly. AX.25 software development for packet data transmission from MHPP and software creation for human machine interface (HMI) SCADA display are required. Analysis and evaluation: this stage is completed after collecting data either based on literature study or field study. 3.1. System performance standards Generally, the system must be able to establish a link connection between DTE MHPP circuit blocks with DCM (data terminating circuit equipment) HMI SCADA on master station, transferring information, transmits data to the monitoring center, and may disconnect if there is any disturbance to the monitored MHPP parameters. In addition, the system is able to interactively interact with the user through a GUI app that serves as HMI, or at least using hyperterminal. The system to be built has several performance standards to be a reference in the implementation and testing system that has been made. Some standard MHPP parameters that are expected to be implemented are as follows: Current. The current in the generator changes rapidly with the changes in the installed load, it is necessary to observe that these fluctuations do not cause damage to both the generator and the load. Voltage. Voltage on the generator needs to be observed to remain stable in accordance with the standard voltage required by the load that is equal to 220 V with a difference of tolerance of 10%. Temperature. The temperature parameter is the temperature of the generator and is kept under normal conditions. 3.2. Design method The design is done by taking into account the real parameters that exist in the MHPP. Some parameters that become the main object to see the performance of MHPP are turbine rotation, voltage, current, and frequency. MHPP parameters consisting of turbine rotation, voltage, current, and frequency in the form of analog data are extracted using sensors which are then converted by analog-to-digital converter and transmitted to the microcontroller into digital data. The data are packed in several groups and packed in frames available on the AX protocol. The data packets that have been entered in the frame on the AX.25 protocol are then sent using KYL-500S as RF transmitters after going through the modulation stage. The data packet is then received by the RF receiver which then demodulates to be readable by the AX.25 protocol at the receiving end. 3.3. System design The developed hardware has a block as shown in Figure 2. On the hardware, it has four blocks. Sensors serve to hold variables to be monitored at MHPP and adjusted to the input voltage for the microcontroller. Microcontroller functions as the main component in this device. Its main task is to organize data from the MHPP, forming the AX.25 protocol and set the correct timing to obtain a signal with a frequency corresponding to the desired audio frequency shift keying (AFSK) modulation. The software created is the one that runs inside the microcontroller. The voltage of the sensor is then taken according to the voltage level required to be converted into data relating to turbine rotation, voltage, current, and temperature information. The data are then set with the AX.25 protocol format. Data that have been formatted in the AX protocol 25 is then transmitted using AFSK modulation.

RTU and MTU RTU circuit is an existing system in the MHPP section that serves to collect data from the installed sensors to observe the parameters to be controlled. RTU circuit is built as many as two units in accordance with the number of MHPP to be monitored. Each RTU is coded according to the location of MHPP, that is, RTU_MHPP_1 for MHPP-1 and RTU_MHPP_2 for MHPP-2. Figure 3 shows the display of the simulation circuit for RTU and MTU MHPP. The MTU circuit serves to receive data from RTU_MHPP_1 and RTU_MHPP_2, the data will be selected according to the data input of each PLTMh. The MTU is then connected to a computer through software that serves to convert serial data to be displayed on the GUI as a SCADA interface. Opens in a new window.Figure 3.Simulation Circuit of RTU and MTU MHPP 4.2. HMI SCADA (GUI) HMI is a display for RTU parameter monitoring which is a collection of sensor data in the form of GUI. This GUI will display the current data, voltage, frequency, and turbine rotation of which the data are taken from each of the monitored MHPP. This view allows the user to observe the state of all parameters so there is no need to look directly at the MHPP location. Figure 4 shows the appearance of the GUI design for monitoring data parameter from each RTU. Opens in a new window.Figure 4.Design of Display for GUI SCADA 5. Conclusion After simulation design of SCADA wireless communication system based on AX.25 protocol the following conclusions can be drawn: The RTU system has been successfully simulated using two ACS712 current sensors, voltage sensor, zero crossing point, frequency sensor, and rotation sensor functionalized to monitor the parameters of MHPP. The AX.25 protocol has been applicable in the wireless SCADA network for monitoring the performance of MHPP by embedding in KYL-500S transceiver radio using 433 MHz frequency switch and AFSK modulation system. Radio transmitter KYL-500S has been successfully simulated to send data from sensor to display on computer through SCADA-built application. Changes in data on the RTU can be displayed properly on the GUI in accordance with the existing view on the location of the MHPP. References Bardzadeh, B.

The Flourish Culture: Liberating Human Potential,2024,"Are we prepared for the post pandemic shifts, the volatility and challenges that demand speedy changes, sudden expansion or downsizing, innovation and solutions as part of the genuine encounter between past work culture and culture of the future? The HR and Leadership and HR need minds that can function within this new space. The evolution of people management, strategic planning, finance and the test of relevance will take the driver's seat and the new culture will need empowered mindset to tap into and maximize the changes that the 4th IR is bringing upon us. Material, tangible and innovative development where flourish culture is injected through all layers of corporate existence and a strategic game plan to sail its people through. As the quantum of work shifts, allow people space to flourish? The challenge may as well be treated as a systemic opportunity to transform the Leadership and HR function to recalibrate the workforce for continual development, addition of newer skills, roles that are benefit driven, specific talent delivery and newer productivity enhancing roles. As we transcend from the information age to yet another age where conceptual innovation will take the lead, data for HR will have scientific interpretations and behaviors around productivity, work, needs, wants, talents and what kind of work culture will be a thriving one. What areas need an overhaul, what can be innovated, what kind of effectiveness is 98needed, what kind of optimization structures can be built and if there can be newer departments incorporated in an organisation are all questions that need answers. The logical growth trajectory of the 3rd digital revolution is characterized by the move toward the 4th industrial revolution. As a consequence, the linear workspace dynamic is witnessing drastic shifts in business and employee functioning with technology playing the role of the break-through and the breakdown partner. Breakthrough in terms of speeding up and simplifying processes via technology and breakdown of Human resource bankability that is being replaced by machines especially routine occupations that can be machinated. The dependence on technologies like Internet, Mobile, AI, automation, big data analytics, and cloud technology, have not only sped up consumption of such technologies, the anticipated impacts are looming over the employment landscape locally and globally. According to a McKinsey Institute report, the 4th industrial revolution will affect approximately one-fifth of the global workforce. Automated Robots are likely to replace approximately 800 million workers worldwide by 2030 and a decrease in numbers of full-time staff by is anticipated by 2022. Over 100 million workers in economies that are known to be the largest (China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Spain, UK, and USA) may need to switch occupations and change professions by 2030. The need to retrain for higher skilled work, work within a technology set up, understanding new and specific technologies is on the rise. The connect between business, its employees, and its multiple stakeholders have and are going through a drastic yet positive shift in terms of access and speed, thanks to multiple technological advances in the touch points and interfaces of their interaction. The dichotomy and sudden separation we are witnessing will need equally powerful solutions at the people level. The need for organizations is not just to retain talent but to make good the mental expansion along with physical shifts employees will encounter as a result. By incorporating automation technology, a disruptive imbalance has been created between job responsibilities completed by humans, their routine function, the involvement of machine and algorithms that measure both. Society and workforce both stands impacted by such technology becoming mainstream. Human resilience, power to adapt, and intelligence, all have a role to play. The human being always has managed to catch up. But the catch lies in riding through this change and takes this 99as an opportunity for human advancement as much as the technological advances. We have the organizations, we have the people, we have some systems, and we also have the willingness to ride this wave. The doors are opening to innovations that we fully do not understand. Will the human resource become a recipient and consumer of this technological tsunami or human resource can play a bigger role in influencing its environment by re-inventing itself through this massive transition? Post pandemic shifts have left the environment volatile, turbulent, and dominated by challenges that demand change. The opportunity to change coupled with the natural resistance to change is right before us. How the leadership and HR will manage this change and its process which in all its truth lies in people management, strategic planning, and finance. This time people cannot be worked through as a system but the systems will need people of an empowered mindset to maximize the changes that the 4th IR is bringing upon us. Are people being prepared for change? Are there new processes and have they been effectively communicated to the people who will undergo the change? Does the leadership have a strategic game plan to sail its people through? Can this change be implemented from the top? Will the strategy bring the people to the forefront and allow them space to flourish based on how much they do? The challenge may as well be treated as an opportunity to transform the HR function from being an employment department to become the People's department, re-defining work, and work cultures, open the gates of creative solutions and give due credit to human resource as key catalyst of this transition. World Economic Forum's report, however, does not paint a dark picture, warns us to avoid a myopic view of these changes and encourages us to ride over and past them in order to flourish. The solution lies in distinctly recalibrating the workforce, redefining roles and responsibilities that open up spaces for continual development, addition of newer skills, roles that are benefit driven, specific talent delivery, and newer productivity enhancing roles. ""These transformations, if managed wisely, could lead to a new age of good work, good jobs and improved quality of life for all, but if managed poorly, pose the risk of widening skills gaps, greater inequality and broader polarization."" - World Economic Forum, 2018 Report People strategies or optimizing human resource or its functioning can be the pivot point of bringing focus back to people within an organization and back them up to flourish through change, focus on their potential to 100grow and create space for lateral growth within a system. What is in it for them is a question that will be asked and this moment in time, we might as well answer that for them. The extensive possibilities that opened up with data analytics in determining consumer behaviors, consumption patterns, focus areas, likes, and dislikes, the same possibility now lies before us to optimize human potential. Data for HR will have scientific interpretations and behaviors around productivity, work, needs, wants, talents and what kind of work culture will be a thriving one. What areas need an overhaul, what can be innovated, what kind of effectiveness is needed, what kind of optimization structures can be built and if there can be newer departments incorporated in an organization are all questions that need answers. However, the ultimate challenge and solution lie in how fast we can anticipate these changes, how fast we are able to prepare our workforces, how fast they can be reskilled, develop optimized mindset that are trained thrive through change, and how fast we can pre-anticipate doors that will close and the ones that would open. The speed at which the change will land in the workplaces, adding velocity, speed, scope, and systems impact, the doors to innovation not yet fully understood will also open. HR function may well be in its most empowering opportunity to alter its mandate and become a master executor of this revolution by simplifying the complexity for their people. The opportunity to create innovative peoples functioning and integrating it with a culture of rapid learning and rapid growth that is emerging from new technology. Keeping in mind the human construct, work responsibilities, fulfillment of needs and their adaptability or resistance to change, maintaining people's productivity in the midst of change will require systemic as well as systematic transition. When human judgment gets replaced by artificial judgment, HR will acquire extensive capabilities of measurement of their human capital and solutions around it, mapping work processes, monitoring systems, speedy execution of new processes, and identifying gaps.","['flourish', 'culture:', 'liberating', 'human', 'potential']"

Editorial: An integrative proposal in addiction and health behaviors psychosocial research: overview of new trends and future orientations,2025,"Wan et al. developed a decision tree model to predict online shopping addiction and identified key contributing factors, including academic procrastination, social anxiety, and a diminished sense of purpose in life. Their study provides valuable insights for the development of targeted interventions aimed at mitigating online shopping addiction. The results indicate that academic procrastination -rooted in avoidance behaviors and ineffective time managementemerges as a predominant factor predisposing individuals to compulsive online shopping. Furthermore, social anxiety, characterized by fear of judgment and avoidance of face-to-face interactions, serves as a significant contributor, with individuals resorting to online shopping as a coping mechanism. In addition, a diminished sense of purpose in life was found to exacerbate compulsive shopping behavior, as individuals seek fulfillment and distraction through online purchases. The results point to the need for targeted intervention strategies that address the key psychological factors and behavioral patterns that drive online shopping addiction.Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual framework, Atsbaha et al. examined the intention to chew khat among adolescents in Raya-Azebo District, Ethiopia. Khat chewing, a common social and cultural practice in Ethiopia, poses significant physical, psychological, and socioeconomic challenges. Despite various interventions to curb its use, the behavior remains widespread, especially among young people. This study aims to assess the factors that influence intention to chew khat and provide evidence-based recommendations for prevention efforts. The results of the study show the importance of social influences and personal beliefs in shaping intentions to chew khat. To change positive attitudes towards khat chewing, the authors suggest strengthening social resistance skills and increasing self-efficacy. Educational programs, community engagement initiatives and policy implementation efforts are recommended to address the growing challenge of khat use in Ethiopia.The relationship between cyberbullying and discrimination among students was explored in the work of Li et al. The authors examined the relationship between perceived discrimination and cyberbullying, identifying self-esteem as a mediator. Their findings suggest that students who experience discrimination are more likely to engage in cyberbullying behavior, largely due to feelings of lowered self-esteem. In addition, the study identified self-compassion as a significant moderating factor that buffers the negative effects of perceived discrimination on self-esteem, thereby reducing the likelihood of engaging in cyberbullying. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving self-esteem and fostering self-compassion may be effective in reducing cyberbullying behavior. In addition, the study highlights the importance of creating inclusive and supportive environments within schools to reduce experiences of discrimination and promote psychological resilience among students.Long et al. analyzed the influence of parental smartphone dependence on Internet addiction among elementary school students during the COVID-19 lock-in in China. Their study identified parent-child conflict as a mediating factor in this relationship, with parental roles moderating the observed effects. Specifically, fathers' dependence on smartphones was found to have a more significant influence on parent-child conflict than mothers' dependence. The results further suggest that parental smartphone overuse contributed to decreased parental involvement, weakened emotional bonds, and reduced overall family cohesion, all of which increased children's susceptibility to Internet addiction. In contrast, mothers, who were often the primary caregivers, were shown to mitigate some of these negative effects by providing emotional support and monitoring. These findings highlight the critical need for interventions aimed at reducing parental screen time, improving family communication, and promoting balanced use of technology in the home.In an interesting focus on new modes of audiovisual consumption in social networks, Hu and Huang investigated the relationship between stress and short video addiction among Chinese users by extending the Compensatory Internet Use (CIU) model. The research introduces an extended CIU (E-CIU) framework that incorporates compensatory motivations-social interaction and relaxing entertainment-and affective responses-immersion and attitude-to better understand the mechanisms driving short video addiction. Key factors identified include emotional escapism, habit formation, and psychological dependence, with stress being the primary motivator that leads people to consume short videos as an emotional regulation mechanism. The findings suggest that the implementation of targeted interventions -such as digital detox initiatives and comprehensive stress management programs -can effectively reduce the risk of short video addiction and promote the adoption of healthier coping mechanisms.Alcohol consumption remains a relevant global health problem. To analyze its incidence in the public sector, Du Sartz de Vigneulles et al. conducted a qualitative study to explore the context of alcohol consumption among French public service employees, with the aim of understanding the underlying behavioral factors and identifying effective prevention measures. Using a qualitative research approach, the study examines the social, occupational, and personal factors that contribute to alcohol use disorders (AUD) in this specific occupational sector. The findings show that work-related stress, organizational culture and prevailing social norms play a significant role in shaping the drinking behavior of employees. In addition, the study identifies factors such as accessibility to alcohol and peer influence as critical contributors to workplace drinking. The authors emphasize the need for a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes organizational interventions such as educational initiatives, stress management programs, and policies to restrict the availability of alcohol in the workplace. These measures are essential to achieving a healthier and more productive workplace.Li et al. examined the influence of family socioeconomic status (SES) on digital addiction among young children, identifying parenting styles as a crucial mediating factor in this relationship. Their findings indicate that lower SES is associated with reduced parental involvement, increased exposure to digital devices, and a heightened risk of developing digital addiction. The study further highlights that authoritative parenting styles serve as a protective factor, effectively mitigating these risks, whereas permissive and neglectful parenting approaches exacerbate excessive screen time and problematic digital usage behaviors. Based on these insights, the authors advocate for socioeconomic interventions that prioritize parental education, improve access to resources, and promote healthy digital habits within families as key strategies for preventing digital addiction in children.Another current major challenge among young people is the growth of online gambling. In this context, Suria-Martínez et al. conducted a comprehensive analysis of the risk profile associated with online gambling among university students, with particular attention to the differences between disabled and non-disabled participants. Their findings indicate that students with disabilities are at increased risk of developing gambling-related problems, indicating an urgent need for specific preventive actions. The study identified several factors that contribute to online gambling behavior, including psychological distress, economic difficulties, and social influences. In particular, students with disabilities face additional challenges, such as social isolation and limited access to alternative recreational activities, which make them more vulnerable to problem gambling. Based on these data, the authors advocate for the implementation of tailored intervention programs at the university level, including financial literacy initiatives, mental health support services, and opportunities for social engagement. These findings underscore the importance of implementing proactive strategies to minimize gambling-related harm and support the development of healthier coping mechanisms among the student population.Liu et al. investigated the impact of negative urgency on implicit mobile phone addiction among college freshmen, particularly in the context of social exclusion. Using a modified GO/NO-GO paradigm, the research examines how impulsivity driven by negative urgency influences students' susceptibility to compulsive mobile phone use and explores the moderating effects of social exclusion on this relationship. The findings of the study indicate that college freshmen with high levels of negative urgency exhibit a stronger tendency toward implicit mobile phone addiction compared to their low-negative urgency counterparts. Experiment 1 demonstrated a significant interaction between negative urgency levels and phone-related stimuli, revealing that individuals with high impulsivity struggle to inhibit responses to mobile phone-related content. Experiment 2 further established that social exclusion exacerbates this tendency, as students experiencing social isolation demonstrated an even greater difficulty in controlling their engagement with phone-related stimuli. A three-way interaction effect was observed, highlighting the combined influence of negative urgency, social exclusion, and stimulus type in shaping mobile phone addiction tendencies. These findings underline the deterministic role of personality traits and environmental factors in the development of behavioral addictions among college students. By providing valuable insights into the interplay between psychological traits and social factors, this study contributes to the wider discourse on mobile phone addiction and highlights the need for holistic prevention strategies that address the unique challenges faced by college freshmen.In this Research Topic, we have collected some of the most relevant trends in the current context of health and addiction research. Based on the included studies, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in the identification of health problems, the design of prevention strategies, and the development of intervention programs and policies is evident. As addictive behaviors continue to evolve in response to societal changes, future research should prioritize the development of integrative frameworks that address the psychological, social, and biological determinants of addiction. In addition, advances in artificial intelligence and big data analytics offer promising opportunities to delve deeper into patterns of addiction, enabling the development of predictive models and personalized treatment strategies.","['editorial:', 'integrative', 'proposal', 'addiction', 'health', 'behaviors', 'psychosocial', 'research:', 'overview', 'trends', 'future', 'orientations']"

Climatic Change and Population Control,2022,"The main reasons for climate change which are explained in this article are as follows: -Climate pollution by gases with CO2 emission and Greenhouse Effect; Climate contamination of viruses with viruses from nature by animals or glaciers when thawing or produced in Laboratories; Induced Climate Change due to meteorological weapons with high intensity radio waves to produce rains, hurricanes and possible induction of earthquakes; Climate pollution by radiation due wars with irreversible consequences in the climate and Nuclear Winter; Climate Change due the explosion of missiles and atomic weapons in the oceans; Climate Change due the natural cyclical phases of the Earth affected by the cyclical variations of the Earth's magnetic field lines which can be affected by the severe cyclical activity of the sun due storms and sunspot because of the combustion that occurs inside the Sun which is due to the gravitational instabilities produced by the planets of the solar system, asteroids or the Comet Planet; Climate Change due to the invading Comet Planet into the solar system that affects with its gravitational field to the sun with solar storms and the planets with variation of the magnetic field lines affecting the climate, earthquakes and activation of volcanoes and indeed with the entry of many meteors and asteroids to the Earth; Climate change due to the Arm of God Allah explaining all the above reasons being more evident in times of Tribulation. The specific methods and devices of the control and manipulation of the population (inclusive to induce to the concupiscence) in times of new world order (Universal Big Brother Program for the control of human in the Earth) and possible Tribulation are explained in this article: Surveillance programs with all technological devices and networks used by humans systematic methods of persuasive manipulation and indoctrination used by some zombie humans and dark; Through the subjugation of employees and humans (inclusive children teaching them how to manipulate in the same style of the zombies); By enterprises or dark groups so that employees make manipulation games with details (investing work time to play like children) receiving bribes, money or labor benefits or with possible retaliation if they do not obey; Surveillance programs in living and working places with covert technological cameras, coincidence games, activities, plans and events programmed in sequence (inclusive pyrotechnic sounds in sequence); Covert numbers and words (in identification documents, cards, car plates, devices used by humans); Encrypted, hidden codes or small phrases and numbers not visible to the naked eye concealed in objects; Covert words in the speech of zombie humans and from multimedia and channels of traditional technological devices through movies, programs and even newscasts and inclusive to speak in code with the humans who know the surveillance programs and worst using in those channels and programs derogatory words against the Nazarenes (in the style of Nazism with the Jews) in complicity of close acquaintances, zombies and dark who participate profiting from the system for the vile metal; By means of an epidemic and viruses produced in laboratories creating epidemics and chaos in the Earth for the reduction and control of the population; Through strict restrictions and reduction of freedoms; Confinement with subsequent compulsory vaccination to be able to access human rights such as the right to work and the right to travel (with the cover-up of the respective organizations responsibles for it: OIT OMT), without responsibility of the authorities in charge of vaccination worldwide (OMS) for the short or long term counterproductive effects of the vaccinated population due to the risk with the liquid of the vaccines by interfering with the DNA and RNA of the population; Possible marking and elimination of many humans (possibility of control of the pulmonary alveoly or induction controlled of diseases or pain due a virus by means of chips introduced in humans); Control of humans by the introduction of liquid and solid chips in humans (liquid crystals that crystallize in the organism and settle in neurons and receive ultrasonic waves of very low frequency) (possibly inserted from vaccines in global epidemiological programs for population control or invasive medical examination when this is not necessary as a figurative example of review of a patient with a sore in the mouth and introduction of the whole hand in the throat or prostate examination or specific injections to certain objective humans or Nazarenes who have opened the matrix of the darks and the elite that controls the humans in the Earth) in times of epidemic in medical examinations and treatments in hospitals (false medical negligence with breach of the medical oath of the use of Medicine for human good). The possible liquid and solid chips introduced into the human being can be used for mind reading (telepath) and thought induction (double direction: sending and receiving messages in the style of Stephen Hawking and the style of the technology already used in sending probes into space and to the moon) and possible human marking with surveillance program and the possible creation of zombie humans. Humans who have the mind reader chip installed can speak without speaking (the dumb speak playing like the miracles of Jesus Christ). It is possible to detect if the humans who have the mental reading chip installed have psychological alterations without going to a doctor. It is possible to know if humans are good or bad without seeing their actions and without going to a priest. In this way, human beings with the chip installed can be sanctioned before they do somewhat wrong (simply because it is known to be thinking). This can be used to know the fidelity to a political guideline or direction (this is known by the strong rumor in communist countries that already have the technology to detect the fidelity to the political party and possibly this is through this chip installed in the human being and mind reading). The inserted chip can also perform thought induction: this is possibly the apocalyptic mark mentioned in the apocalypse because many humans will perform sins or concupiscence induced and not naturally. Then, this will most probably activate the Wrath of God, the seals, and the trumpets of the apocalypse. It surprises me that actually the OMS wants to bring the vaccination program to Africa when in Africa there are not many dead by the epidemy (possibly for the control and reduction of the population will be in all the Earth). Afterward, the OMS mentioned that wants to insert a manufacturing center of vaccines in many countries and inclusive vigilance programs (possibly for the control and reduction of the population will be effective at the local level). But, what the OMS needs to mention is that it is necessary to eliminate the laboratories of virus creation and not create more vaccine laboratories. Humans do not want more vaccine and injections and laboratories for the creation of vaccines but the elimination of virus laboratories which are most probably used for for the control and reduction of the population: thus, the reason for spreading a virus created in a laboratoy across the Earth is evident: population reduction and control of humanity in preparation for a global elite program (new world order or program 2030 for the control of the dark and of the elite; Connection of covert surveillance cameras (in living and working places) with channels of traditional technological devices through movies, programs and even newscasts (including newscasts that usually make signs of dumb and deaf to those who have already discovered them) used by the dark with the respective programs and in addition, to monitor and tracing to verify the induction to concupiscence through mental reading (chips in humans) and surveillance cameras on line in the best style of James Bond espionage movies (including control of faces, pupils, irises, reflections, details and diseases); Games of judgments of sin against humans and Nazarenes (playing at being gods) and also profiting from the vile metal through the system and contributing to the persecution of the Nazarenes; Fake judgments of sin against humans and Nazarenes because many of these sins have been induced with technology due the possible induction of thoughts by the liquid cristal settle in neurons and have not been natural (dark inducing sin through technology and playing gods to induce evil and destruction of intimacy and privacy even in the mind of the human being); Retaliation to those who report the surveillance and manipulation programs and marking of humans for mind reading (telepathy) and thought induction (making them sick sending to the hospitals or removing them); Digital identification plan and digital money to do digital control and avoid conflict and protests of marked and Nazarenes in surveillance programs who discover that there is no privacy in their documents and inclusive in theirs mind (telepathy: mind reading and thought induction: artificial intelligence): it surprises that EU mention that has a digital plan for europeans for digital control on line. But, before the epidemy, Europe and the world advanced a lot in technology and the data of humans are digitally in hospitals and institutes that humans need. After, the EU mentions artificial intelligence for human beings. Then and in vaccination and epidemy time, it is possible that the digital control is a new digital control with artifitial intelligence and with possible chips installed in the human being (possibly already installed in many human beings); Games of events and coincidences to cause accidents or conflicts in the life of marked, target or Nazarenes (change games of victim to accused by companies that regulate the order with subsequent rectification of the game made by the same companies when the Nazarenes claim); Games of recognition of the identity of human beings (in the style of the movie Unknown) by enterprises and service stations which are necessary for the daily movement of human beings creating conflicts of manipulation and stress in the marked or Nazarenes Salary payment games (payment of wages with dinners and game of check payment) creating manipulation conflicts and stress in the life of marked, target or Nazarenes Programmed plans of theft and scams of enterprises and humans even knowing of the surveillance cameras for the control of the marked, target or Nazarenes. Then, there is severe control of human beings in their daily activities to verify the follow-up of the matrix and darks that plan situations of concupiscence in the human being. Besides, this is occurring in coincidence with an accelerated new world order program and possible tribulation times and possibly already with the installation of the apocalyptic mark (possible chips introduced in the human being for mind reading and thought induction to induce concupiscence) in humans mentioned in the apocalypse for dark control of humans. The global forms of the severe manipulation and population control in times of new world order and Tribulation are explained in this article are as follows: By increasing taxes; Through armed conflicts and wars create discord, wars and chaos between countries (often bordering countries with the same origins and with the same culture: Russia and Ukraine: war motivated by US OTAN EU): To later usurp its resources (oil energy resource: US Iraq Kuwait); To later control them politically and economically (US Iraq Kuwait) and when these power or developed countries cannot control or usurp their resources, they begin to block them economically (Russia in the war between Russia and Ukraine where besides developed countries influence in the war by printing additional money to use for the war causing imbalance and global economic crisis instead of looking for ways to avoid it) in order to cause chaos and economic crisis with the knowledge and complicity of the world organizations responsible (OEA ONU) and make the population believe that the cause of the economic crisis is the government in power. However, some countries have resisted these blockades (Cuba Venezuela Nicaragua Russia China) and managed to show that it is possible to have governments independent of the control of these powers or countries that believe they own the Earth; To put rulers (governing) of interest in the same countries in conflict; To control them using the pretext of placing military bases in the countries in conflict (NATO OTAN: military bases in some European countries, US military bases: in some South American countries and some countries of Europe). In addition, this is preferable to reduce military bases in other countries and reduction of nuclear weapons, and use the financial resources for the reduction of inequity and poverty on the Earth. Thus, the organizations responsible for the proliferation of nuclear weapons (OIEA) have played an ineffective and passive (cover-up) role, which has caused the risk of a third nuclear world war to be imminent); Through the war against terror: however and actually, this is a false speech used to point to countries that oppose the control or directive of the powers and that have a culture or political structure different from that of the powers and later make conflict and war to later control them or usurp their resources (some Arab and Muslim countries, for example, US, Irak, Lybia and blaming an entire country for terrorism and occupying for years (Afganistán)). In this way and actually, some countries have developed nuclear weapons (North Korea, Iran) to protect themselves in some way and thus, the same thing does not happen to them as to the countries mentioned above (Irak, Lybia) and that have been destroyed with the false discourse of the war against terror. In this way, the best thing is to have good relations with all the countries of the Earth which are again summed in the Bible [1] in a message: Love your brother (all human beings) as yourself! (Mt.22-39) (and not to go around the Earth pointing out terrorists to any country that opposes its guidelines). Therefore, it is possible to reduce the economic resources for the war against terror which can be used to reduce poverty and inequity in human beings; Through the war against drugs: there are many other substances and products consumed by humans that can be harmful to health and that are allowed and have not become a vice (when something is forbidden: this increases the interest in obtaining it explained from the beginning of creation in Genesis [1]: an apple from the tree of good and evil in the garden of Eden: Adam and Eve). In addition, many countries have allowed the use of certain types of drugs for medical purposes (Uruguay, Bolivia) where drug use has gone unnoticed in these countries; Through religión: with a structure of religion that tries to control the population through a guideline and speeches that obey the Vatican and the actual governments of each country (which is evident when there are countries such as Nicaragua that do not follow a guideline of the church and the elite and then, the religion surprisingly actively intervenes in politics): the conclusion is reached and to which many humans have reached, that religion is a power most actually used (along with political and economic power); Through political power by means of the false argument used by politicians to reduce inequity and poverty: where a large amount of resources and money have been allocated to the political powers and rulers of many countries for centuries by the respective organizations responsable (FMI BM) without any results and in many countries poverty and inequity have increased. Besides, the bureaucracy is a structure of order and rules of management and administration used within the governments of each country that contribute to the inefficiency and manipulation of the required procedures in human life that ultimately affect the life of each human being when they require formalities that end up being complicated and time-consuming. Then, this power structure in politics, economics, and religion for the control of the population is ineffective and obeys the interests of the dark who control humans on the Earth, and is used ineffectively by the rulers (governing) of the countries who come to power precisely with the false discourse of reducing poverty and inequity; Through the pretext of climate change: severe climate change due to the emission of CO2 and the greenhouse effect is a complete fallacy. The world organizations involved with the climate (ONU) try to make humanity believe that this is the reason for the severe climatic changes that the human being has experienced on the Earth to obtain economic resources and avoid mentioning God in control of the Earth and course the climate and to avoid mentioning the Omnipotence of God [1] in the control of the Earth and the climate: the severe climate change is frequently due to solar storms and variations in the magnetic field lines of the Earth because of gravitational variations in the solar system or due to the entry of an asteroid or Comet Planet what is controlled and all the Universe by God. Therefore, the climate change is controlled by the Eternal God (wich is explained in the Bibles with a lot of examples with Moses, Josue, Hezekiah) and thus, this is better to use the resources and money for so-called climate change to reduce poverty and inequity in the Earth and increase equity in humans: Human Beings must not believe everything said by the organizations and individuals that control the humans in the Earth and that obey the directions imposed within the matrix triangle of control of the Earth; Through the sport by means of the persuasive manipulation of observers or attendees at sporting events through commercials programs, commentators (hidden words and numbers in speech), players participating in the match: with gestures or sequence of plays, numbers, words or details in the players uniform, referees (make decisión of plays in favor of a team purposely: false bad arbitration) or leading organizers committing sports corruption not applying the rules or discriminating players (Serbian, Russian and Belarusian tennis players at tennis competitions due to some tennis organizations) or teams (Russian sports clubs and inclusive the Russian national team due FIFA decision) at convenience. Besides, when there are countries in conflict or war: instead of uniting the countries in conflict by means of the sport, the respective organizations (FIFA UEFA) discriminate and increase the conflict: discriminating and not allowing the participation of tennis players (including top tennis players), Football Countries and Sport Clubs in international competitions for reasons of restrictions due to the epidemic, conflict or war (including countries that organized previous World Cups: Russia) where the interest, quality and love for this sport has increased and that must be used to unite human beings and countries and not to not allow them to participate: which increases the division and conflict between countries or humans: This is important to highlight and value the position of the ATP for deciding that the ATP does not agree that athletes from certain countries (Russia and Belarus) cannot participate in international tournaments stating that this is against the principles of merit and non-discrimination: then, this is tremendously criticizable that the organization responsible of Football (FIFA UEFA) participates in armed conflicts or war with discriminatory decisions in Football, increasing the war by not allowing countries in conflict to participate in World Cup of Football: FIFA slogan of no to racism and some form of discrimination is a complete farce and used for convenience and interest (in the same style of all the other organizations (mainly ONU, OEA, FMI, BM, VATICAN) that control humans and that in 2000 years of the coming of the Envoy of God have not been able to solve iniquity and poverty), discrimination that has been evident in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine: Football is the main sport in the Earth and it is the one that can unite human beings the most and should be used as a source of union and not división; Through education: where this is used by many countries to induce and manipulate their inhabitants in a certain political direction through the dissemination of knowledge and even the textbooks of the students: many underdeveloped countries have increased illiteracy and degradation in education because this favors the politicians of the country's government: having an ignorant people who do not see what they do with the country's money and who cannot criticize them: the greatness of peoples depends on the education that gives the independence of individuals who are the ones that make the country advance; Through world organizations to control countries: ONU, OEA, Vatican, OTAN, UE: many countries have to obey the guidelines of these organizations, which often do not respond to the needs of the citizens of each country: many institutions in the countries must obey the organizations (the Vatican for the religion) in a rigid way, which is often not in accordance with the situation of the country's citizens, who often need new variants or guidelines (some organizations can cause chaos, conflict or war as for example the war of Russia with Ucrania where the possible annexation of Ucrania to the OTAN and UE is one of the reasons for the war between these two countries. Therefore, there would be no war between these two countries where without those organizations); Through world organizations of espionage (CIA, FBI, KGB, Gestapo, SS): employing persuasive interference in the countries and rulers of some undeveloped countries (some South America and Center America countries and some European, Asia and Africa countries) with the objective of the power countries of control, manipulate or destabilize countries and inclusive simple humans (using the personal data of thousands of people around the world). Through the control and intervention of the Creator God Allah which is necessary and essential in times of Tribulation at the time timely (Holy Bible: Apoc. 6 Apoc. 8:6 Apoc. 5 Apoc. 7 Apoc. 21) due to everything mentioned in this scientific research respect to the control and manipulation of the population (regarding the increase of inequity, discord, and evil among humans) which is not following the guideline given by the envoy of God 2000 years ago: Jesus Christ.

Currently VHA employs over 110,000 total nursing staff at all education levels, but future nursing workforce needs are significant. Since 1999, the VHA National Nursing Education Initiative (NNEI) program has provided 16,294 scholarships for registered nurses to attain baccalaureate and advanced nursing degrees. NNEI awards cover tuition and related expenses in return for a 1- to 3-year service obligation. The goal of this evaluation was to determine factors that enhanced or hindered an NNEI scholarship recipient in the completion of their degree and service obligation to the VHA.Methods: A regression analysis was performed on potential explanatory variables chosen from the scholarship database to identify predictors of degree completion for 10,043 NNEI participants in 162 VHA facilities from 2000 to 2012. This limitation ensured that participants had adequate time to complete both degree and service obligation.Results: Significant predictors of degree completion were gender, age, date entered the program, degree at entry, and intended completion occupation. Eighty-six percent (86.7%) of NNEI participants completed the degree requirement. Of those who completed their degree, 97% completed the service obligation. Ninety-six percent (96.5%) of those completing their service obligation were still employed in VHA target occupations 2 years later.Conclusion: NNEI scholarships are an effective tool for recruitment and retention of VHA nurses.An Exploration of New Graduate Nurses' Transitions to Specialty PracticeKathleen Baldwin, PhD, RN, ACNS-BC, AGPCNP-BC, FCNS, FAAN; Jo Nell Wells, PhD, RNTexas Health ResourcesBackground: Becoming a competent, independent nurse is challenging for new graduate nurses (NGNs), particularly those hired directly into high acuity specialty areas (HASAs). This study sought to expand the knowledge about NGN transition to HASA practice by exploring factors that help and hinder them. Aims were to (1) describe personal factors which help or hinder success, (2) describe unit factors which help or hinder success, (3) identify subjects' recommendations that might make the transition easier for future HASA NGNs, and (4) compare HASA subjects' experiences with non-HASA NGN peers.Methods: Following institutional review board approval, HASA NGNs in the Versant Residency Program over 1 year who consented to participate composed the convenience sample. Six open-ended interview questions reflecting themes identified in previous research were developed. Subjects were asked the same 6 questions at baseline, at 6 months, and at 1 year. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis.Results: Six NGN intrinsic factors were identified (mastering time management/prioritization skills, becoming assertive and taking initiative, having prior work experience especially as a tech on their HASA, developing good interpersonal skills, having a life outside of work, and being a patient advocate). Three extrinsic unit-specific themes (communication styles, teamwork, and the degree of inclusiveness of the staff) and 2 main differences with non-HASA NGNs (the depth of specialty knowledge needed and the high acuity of HASA patients) were identified. Three individual strategies and 3 institutional strategies were also identified.Conclusion: Evaluating and acting on NGNs' perceptions of factors aiding their success are essential to improve retention in HASAs. HASA NGNs requested additional unit-specific classes, simulation experiences, and hands-on practice specifically designed for their HASAs. There is an urgent need for additional research on extended orientation time, support strategies during early independent practice, and mentors in the HASA setting.Improving Learner Engagement Through Escape RoomsSarah Owens, MSN, RNOchsner Medical Center – New OrleansBackground: During the onboarding period, new hires are presented an abundance of information. For learners to develop proficiency, the education they receive must be engaging. The literature positively correlates an engaging learning environment with the adult learner's ability to retain knowledge. Utilizing gamification techniques, such as an escape room, is one method of engaging adult learners.Methods: In August 2021, an escape room was implemented within a new hire nurse orientation at an acute care facility. The topics included in the scenario were intentionally kept broad, as the nurses who attended the orientation worked in a variety of patient care areas. Patient safety, hospital resources, and medication administration are examples of topics included. A total of 15 new hire nurses participated in the escape room. The learners were randomly divided into 3 groups of 5 learners. Learners primarily consisted of new graduate nurses. Each group was given 20 minutes to escape. After each group completed the room, a debrief was conducted. After the debrief, the group was asked to complete a survey that measured their perceptions on how engaging the escape room was to their learning.Results: Of the learners, 93.3% ""strongly agreed"" that the escape room was more engaging compared to traditional lecture styles, and 86.7% ""strongly agreed"" they would like to see escape rooms used in their future nursing education. The primary theme in the qualitative analysis was that learners had ""fun."" Another theme noted was that learners found the method ""engaging"" and ""creative.""Conclusion: Adult learners value learning through personal experiences and problem solving. Adult learners also receive most of their education in a traditional didactic method. Escape rooms are an engaging teaching method. Nurse educators should remain vigilant of their chosen method of teaching and receptive to including gamification strategies, such as escape rooms.Development of the Inquiry and Innovation Oversight CouncilJenni Day, PhD, RN; Scott Taylor, DNP, CRNP; Danielle Evans, MS, BA, RN, CCRN, NE-BCUniversity of Maryland Medical CenterBackground: Inquiry (performance improvement, evidence-based practice [EBP], research) is essential for patient outcomes improvement and for professional development. Singular council oversight facilitates the identification of duplicate initiatives and connects team members completing similar projects to improve efficiency and strengthen projects. Our 960-bed, 2-campus academic medical center did not have a formal process to share best practices and project outcomes. Within the shared governance structure, multiple councils separately provided support and mentorship for inquiry projects. The primary purpose of this project was to form a new council providing oversight for nursing inquiry projects.Methods: Leaders from the Nursing Research and EBP Council (NREBPC) and the Nursing Performance Improvement Council (NPIC) convened to discuss both council- and project-related challenges. Leaders identified that a combined council could support the continuum of inquiry and that scholarly work would be promoted by providing team members resources and support for developing projects. We drafted a charter to provide a framework for the new Inquiry and Innovation Oversight Council's purpose and scope. During the 2-hour monthly meeting, the first hour is a combined meeting with all members. In the second hour, NREBPC and NPIC meet separately to discuss initiatives specific to their mission. We created a process to capture new projects via an online form that is accessible on an outside intranet and via QR code and shortened URL. Submissions are triaged by council leadership, and projects are presented at council meetings for review and discussion.Results: Nearly 30 council members attended the inaugural meeting in April 2021, with attendance continuing to be strong at subsequent meetings (26-29 attendees) despite staffing and patient care challenges.Conclusion: A council with oversight for all inquiry projects facilitates the implementation of best practices for patient care. Providing support encourages team members to see projects through completion and fosters the diffusion of successful projects across both campuses.Implementing a User-Friendly Program to Ensure Employee Safety Against Hazardous MedicationsNattie Leger, MSN, RN, LSSBB; Ann Lockhart, MN, RN-BC; Maria Nix, RN, MSN; Tammy Mayer, BSN, RN-BC; Jennifer Hymel, BSN, RN; Andrea Thibodeaux, BSN, RN-BCOchsner HealthBackground: The United States Pharmacopeia, Chapter 800 (USP 800) provides standards to protect employees handling hazardous drugs. This regulation impacts many aspects of nursing practice, and because nurses have repeated exposure to medications, they have a higher risk of exposure than patients receiving short-term treatment. Nursing leaders at a large, academic medical center collaborated with a multidisciplinary work group to create action plans to comply with the USP 800 regulation.Methods: Members of the work group performed direct observations of nursing workflows to develop necessary action plans to ensure compliance with the new regulation. Based on the organizational risk assessment, the work group developed the following: Policies to ensure patient and staff safety and environmental protectionA hazardous drug symbol as a visual cue for employees to identify hazardous medications for patients in ambulatory, hospital, and ancillary settingsStandard operating procedures which outlined responsibilities for staff receiving, administering, handling, and disposing of hazardous medicationsA personal protective equipment guide to offer protection from hazardous drug exposureA waste disposal guide quick reference tool to ensure safe workflowsVisual cues in the electronic medical record so clinical staff could easily identify hazardous drug categoriesEmployee discipline-specific education plan to provide general awareness training for the USP 800 regulationsA hazardous drug handling toolkit reference guideResults: The plan to evaluate the program included employee education compliance, environmental surveillance of hazardous medication residue on countertops and surfaces, and medical surveillance measuring employee exposure to toxic chemicals. Future evidence is needed to ensure the protection of health care workers from hazardous medication exposure that may cause cancer and other health hazards.Conclusion: USP 800 has wide-reaching implications for nursing practice. Continued planning and execution of evidence-based practice workflows is necessary to ensure employee safety against exposure to hazardous drugs.The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Registered NursesKathleen Baldwin, PhD, RN, ACNS-BC, AGPCNP-BC, FCNS, FAAN; Kristin Hall, MS, RN; Malorie Bishop, BSN, RN; Magally Rolen, BSN, RN; Marklin Jones, BSN, RN; Stephanie Bailey, BSN, RN; Samantha Hall, BSN, RNTexas Health ResourcesBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic created a health care disaster. Research from other countries showed that nurses have had difficulty coping with it. Mental health professionals have not treated individuals coping with this level of public health emergency.Methods: The purpose of this descriptive, mixed-methods research study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline RNs in a major health care system. The Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was used to collect quantitative data. Two open-ended questions were used to collect qualitative data.Results: Results from the IES-R and demographic questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Responses from the 2 qualitative questions were analyzed using content analysis. Subjects were 1,319 RNs, who represented 18% of the health care system RNs. The mean IES-R score for the sample was 23.5, indicating that symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder were present. Regression analysis showed that nurses in their 20s and 30s had higher IES-R scores than older nurses. Of RNs in their 20s, 84.7% provided direct care to COVID-19 patients compared to 70% of older nurses. Content for the question that asked what else the health care system could have done reflected 11 topics. The top 2 were staffing and communication concerns. Five themes emerged from the question that asked RNs about their experience during the pandemic: work environment concerns, physical responses, psychological responses, family changes/stress, and public misinformation.Conclusion: The psychological toll on RNs and their families was significant. Increased psychological services will be needed for them. There were many eerie similarities between this pandemic and the 1918 pandemic, so the recommendations for improvement from 1918 were not addressed. There needs to be a national response plan that is evidence-based and incorporates what we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to assure that the country is ready for the next one.Care for our Caregivers: Improving Staffs’ Perceptions of Organizational Support Following Distressing EventsDonna Copeland, DNP, RN, NE-BC, CPN, CPON, AE-C; Ashleigh F. Bowman, DNP, RN, CRNP, CPNP-AC; Rosanna Johnson, MSN, RN; Amy E. Davis, DNP, RNC-MNNUniversity of South AlabamaBackground: Unexpected or traumatic patient-related events can lead to psychological trauma, resulting from an overwhelming amount of stress that exceeds one's ability to cope with the distressing event. The emotional distress encountered after an unexpected or traumatic patient event is known as second victim syndrome. Intensive care and pediatric unit staff are especially susceptible to the risk and severity of second victim syndrome due to the vulnerable patient populations they serve. Developing strategies for resilience and social support is recommended for mitigating the adverse effects of second victim syndrome. A pilot study was implemented in the pediatric intensive care unit to improve staffs' perceptions of available support after a distressing event by 10% at the end of 3 months of deployment of a second victim support program.Methods: A mixed-methods, institutional review board–approved research study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a second victim peer support program. Staffs’ perceptions of organizational support were assessed preimplementation via the Medically Induced Trauma Support Services (MITSS) Organizational Assessment Tool. The Scott Three-Tiered Model was the framework adopted, a peer-to-peer support group of volunteers was recruited and trained, and an on-call team of peer supporters was scheduled to provide emotional support for staff 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, as needed.Results: Preliminary results of the preintervention MITSS Organizational Assessment Tool revealed that more than 50% of staff felt that psychological support services were not currently available at the facility. This finding confirmed the need to establish a peer support program to foster care for our caregivers.Conclusion: The project is ongoing; staff will be resurveyed after the 3-month implementation of the second victim peer support program. Expected outcomes are that staff report improved perceptions of organizational support afforded to them by the second victim peer support program.A Call to Action: How One Health Care System Is Improving Birth OutcomesJennifer Melton, MSN, RN, C-ONQS, IBCLCOchsner HealthBackground: Pregnancy and childbirth are a time of great joy and excitement but can also be a time of sorrow and grief. In August 2018, the Louisiana Department of Health released its Maternal Mortality Review Report for the years 2011-2016. According to Kieltyka, Mehta, Schoellmann, and Lake (2018), the maternal mortality rate in Louisiana was higher than in other states, and the most common causes of death were hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, Black women were four times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications than White women.Methods: Faced with these sobering statistics, the Women's Services teams at the Ochsner Baptist, Baton Rouge, Kenner, St. Anne, and West Bank campuses began to focus on reducing severe maternal mortality and morbidity (SMM) related to postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia. Numerous best practices were implemented, including standardized treatment protocols, performing a hemorrhage risk assessment, quantifying blood loss, staff and provider education, and health equity training.Results: Through their efforts, the teams reduced their SMM rates related to postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia from 1.07% of patients in 2016 to 0.63% of patients in 2019. Despite this initial decrease, the teams saw an increase in SMM cases in the first half of 2020 with a rate of 0.77%. Sadly, racial disparities were still identified. We are awaiting the final 2020 results and are expanding our efforts to focus on patient partnership and health care equity.Conclusion: Despite initial reductions, there was an increase in SMM in 2020. We must continue to focus on staff and provider knowledge and compliance with treatment protocols. Nurses play a key role in ensuring that patients have a safe birthing experience. By educating and engaging nurses, leaders can empower the staff to advocate for their patients and ensure positive outcomes.Proactive Rapid Response PilotMelanie Kendrick, MSN, RN, CCRNOchsner Medical Center – West BankBackground: Any delay to care for a deteriorating patient in the inpatient hospital setting can lead to poor patient outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased length of stay, increased outpatient care once discharged, and risk for repeat hospitalizations (Clayton, 2019). Gilroy et al (2020) explain that many cardiac arrest events are preventable, and patients often begin to have changes to vital signs and mental status several hours before the emergent event. Well-trained professionals can often detect and act on these changes to prevent further decline, thus improving mortality rates. We initiated a pilot program during the first COVID-19 surge in April 2020 that involved the creation of the role of proactive rapid response nurse and the ability to identify deteriorating patients outside of critical care areas, specifically the medical-surgical and telemetry units at Ochsner West Bank.Methods: The proactive rapid response nursing role was developed using Benner's Novice to Expert Theory for the theoretical framework and the Plan-Do-Study-Act model for implementation. The number of proactive rounds, rapid response events, and code blue events outside of critical care areas were measured before and after implementation.Results: Over the 6-week trial period from April 29, 2020 to June 4, 2020, code blue events decreased by 60%, and rapid response events decreased by 78% compared to the previous year in the same time frame in the absence of a proactive rapid response nurse.Conclusion: Ochsner West Bank has seen a reduction in emergent events outside of critical care areas with the initiation of a proactive rapid response nurse utilizing set monitoring based on recommendations from Ochsner's critical care coordinators and the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines - Resuscitation program.Virtual Surveillance: Screening for Clinical Deterioration and Sepsis Using Decision Support ToolsFiona Winterbottom, DNP, ACNS-BCOchsner HealthBackground: Patients experiencing clinical deterioration, including those with sepsis, have a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Early warning scores and artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tools within the medical record partnered with clinical workflows offer new opportunities for proactive interventions and a reduction of preventable death.Methods: From July to August 2021, two prediction tools were piloted by virtual nurses. One tool was specific to sepsis and the other was for clinical deterioration. Each shift, virtual nurses would screen patients using both tools to identify patients who might benefit from early intervention and clinical management. The work of the virtual nurse removed the burden of screening from the bedside staff.Results: During the study period, two sets of virtual nurses completed screening. Local 24/7 virtual nurses with responsibilities for clinical deterioration screening, admits, and discharges answered 86% of AI alerts, down from their usual 95% alert response. Novel sepsis screens were completed by offsite 8-hour virtual nurses who increased automated sepsis screening from 1% to 31%.Conclusion: Virtual nurses with targeted responsibilities for clinical deterioration surveillance are more likely to have higher screening completion rates.POSTER ABSTRACTSThe “Not-So-Secret Shopper” Hand Hygiene InitiativeDiana Sierra, MSN, RN, CGRN; Toni Brousse, BSN, RN, CGRNOchsner Medical Center – New OrleansBackground: Although hand hygiene prevents morbidity and mortality, hand hygiene practices remain inadequate. Hand hygiene monitoring is a standard across acute care hospitals in the United States, with direct observation the preferred method of monitoring recommended by the World Health Organization. The purpose of this project was to implement an unblinding initiative where 50% of our hand hygiene secret shoppers overtly observed hand hygiene practices and provided real-time feedback to staff. Expected outcomes included the following: 2 endoscopy units would reach the hospital goal of 90% hand hygiene compliance, and all endoscopy hand hygiene observers would submit a minimum of 50 observations per month.Methods: Fifty percent of hand hygiene secret shoppers within the departments were unblinded, while the remaining 50% remained secret. Infection Control calculated the total secret and unblinded observations and missed opportunities monthly. Staff received the departments' hand hygiene compliance percentages via email monthly and at bimonthly staff meetings.Results: A total of 32,632 hand hygiene observations were performed. Both endoscopy units reached and maintained the hospital goal of 90% hand hygiene compliance through Quarter 4 2020. The observers increased their observations once the unblinding initiative began, meeting and exceeding the required number of observations through Quarter 4 2020.Conclusion: Through the “Not-So-Secret Shopper” Hand Hygiene Initiative, endoscopy underwent a culture change, opening channels of communication among providers with the united goal of exemplifying Ochsner Health's value of putting ""Patients First"" through hand hygiene accountability.Implementing an Evidence-Based Tool to Improve Nursing Self-Efficacy for Concussion AssessmentsKatherine M. Deering, DNP, RN, CPN, CNE; Alison H. Davis, PhD, RN, CHSELSU Health New Orleans School of NursingBackground: Almost 500,000 children under the age of 14 visit emergency departments annually for assessment and evaluation of concussion symptoms. Since 2000, there has been a substantial increase in the number of pediatric patients, both inpatient and outpatient, evaluated for and diagnosed with concussions. School nurses play a crucial role in concussion assessment and management in the pediatric patient population. The school nurse should be an essential part of the development of the school or district concussion protocol and policy, provide follow-up evaluation, and ensure the policy is followed.Methods: Using the L-SES survey, nurses were surveyed on their level of self-efficacy for concussion assessments preimplementation of the Acute Concussion Evaluation - Emergency Department (ACE-ED) assessment tool. Weekly emails highlighting concussion topics and questions were sent to nurses during the 8 weeks of the project implementation. The DNP project leader conducted several site visits during implementation. Postimplementation L-SES surveys were administered at the conclusion of the 8-week implementation period.Results: A paired-samples t test was performed on the survey data which indicated a significant increase in nursing self-efficacy for concussion assessments from preimplementation to postimplementation of the ACE-ED tool. There was a statistically significant increase (P<0.001) in self-efficacy scores from preimplementation (M=36.47, SD=9.724) to postimplementation (M=47.27, SD=7.741), t(14) = -4.676 (two-tailed).Conclusion: The ACE-ED provides a reliable, standardized concussion assessment framework on which nursing self-efficacy for concussion assessments can be built. The potential exists for improving nursing self-efficacy for concussion assessments when the ACE-ED is utilized in the school setting.Inpatient Smoking Cessation: A Quality Improvement ProjectShannon Harris, DNP, FNP-BC, RN, CCRN, TTS; Lori Prewitt Moore, DNP, FNP-B, RN, CHSE; Tochie Lofton, DNP, RN; Aphry Olafson, RRT; Robert Percy, MDInfirmary Health - Mobile, ALBackground: Cigarette smoking is the leader in preventable causes of death in the United States. Evidence-based inpatient smoking cessation programs are needed to reduce unnecessary smoking-related health care spending. The goal of this project was to explore inpatient smoking-cessation strategies to mitigate smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 30-day readmissions.Methods: A quality improvement project was developed which included implementing the modified Fagerström test for nicotine dependence with hospitalized smokers in a large, nonprofit, 669-bed setting.Results: There were 659 patients who were receptive to receiving smoking cessation information and participating in the smoking cessation quality improvement project. During the implementation phase, 264 patients with COPD were admitted to the hospital, and 50 patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The average of readmissions over the 5 months during the implementation phase was 15.2%. A year after the implementation phase, 210 patients with COPD were admitted to the hospital, and 34 of those were readmitted within 30 days after discharge. The average of readmissions over the 4-month period was 7.8%. A statistically significant decrease in COPD 30-day readmissions from 2019-2020 was found (F ratio=17.22013, P=0.00321).Conclusion: The lack of smoking cessation coaches is a huge barrier to implementing a productive tobacco cessation program. Hospital administration can implement smoking cessation hospitalwide protocols to identify smokers upon admission to minimize exorbitant health care smoking-related costs and readmissions.Dilution Amount and Time Required to Give Intravenous Push MedicationsKathleen Baldwin, PhD, RN, ACNS-BC, AGPCNP-BC, FCNS, FAAN; Kristin Hall, MS, RN; Shara Gray, BSN, RNTexas Health ResourcesBackground: Studies show that some drugs once administered by intermittent intravenous (IV) infusion can be safely administered by IV bolus/push (IVP). Because there was no standardization among nurses giving IVP medications in our health care system, patients complained about variations between nurses. The objectives of this initiative were to (1) identify IVP drugs frequently given in our health care system; (2) compare IVP dilution amounts and administration times across drug references, published guidelines, and research studies; and (3) recommend dilution amounts and administration times for IVP drugs to standardize practice.Methods: Nursing drug references, published guidelines, and research articles were identified and reviewed. Two nurse researchers separately reviewed and documented information in each reference. The entire research team reviewed results and reached consensus about the dilution amount and administration time for each drug. The nursing recommendations were sent to system clinical pharmacists who edited them using information from pharmacy drug references and then approved dilution amounts and administration times for IVP drugs.Results: Drug references frequently used by nurses varied in recommendations for dilution amounts and administration times for some of the IVP drugs, resulting in variation in IVP administration practices by nurses. Standardized IVP drug dilution amounts and administration times are currently being incorporated into the electronic medication administration record. A wall chart will be posted in all hospital unit medication rooms, and a computer app is also being developed.Conclusion: Both the clinical nurse researchers and clinical pharmacists were surprised and concerned by the variations seen in drug references frequently used by all frontline staff. Standardization of IVP medication dilution amounts and administration times will improve nursing medication practices and should decrease patients’ concerns about variation in IVP medication administration.

Reflections of Understanding Smart Industry,2022,"Abstract This chapter reflects on the understanding of the phenomenon known as Smart Industry, Industry 4.0, fourth industrial revolution, and many other labels. It does so by reflecting on the issue of terminology, as well as the existing diversity regarding the description of the phenomenon. The issue of meaning is addressed by assessing the results from Culot, Nassimbeni, Orzes, and Sartor (2020) and Habraken and Bondarouk (2019) which are, subsequently, used to develop a workable description. Findings from the two assessed studies raise the question of whether a workable construction of the phenomenon is to be understood as the key technologies or the distinctive developments? A question without a definitive answer, but I will present my view by taking inspiration from the manner in which the prior industrial revolutions are commonly understood. This leads to a, still multifaceted though, more focused understanding of the phenomenon. The insights, formulated proposition and developed model stemming from the reflection of terminology and meaning of the phenomenon helps move the current technology-related phenomenon forward. They assist with the establishment of well-documented papers. A critical aspect if we aim to understand how management will look like in the era of this phenomenon.

What started out as a German initiative to strengthen the competitiveness of the German manufacturing sector resulted in a global phenomenon which has received an increasing amount of attention over the past years; a development that has been documented both in words and numbers. But contradictory to its popularity, the understanding of the phenomenon is surrounded by ambiguity. For not only did the interest in the phenomenon grow, so did the number of labels and meanings related to the phenomenon. Given the impracticality behind this combination (i.e. popularity and ambiguity), the confusion and lack of conceptualization of the phenomenon has received attention by scholars. With a recent study being the systematic literature review by Culot et al. (2020), the authors assessed definitions for the phenomenon, that is Industry 4.0 and similar concepts, in academic as well as non-academic articles. In light of the findings from this systematic literature review, the proposition written in the dissertation by Habraken (2020, p. 136) and the importance of establishing a more stable foundation from which to work with regarding the current phenomenon, this chapter reflects on the understanding of the phenomenon from both a terminology and meaning perspective. By reflecting on noticeable issues that are at play, steps can be constructed that will help move the phenomenon forward. In other words, this chapter does not offer specifics when it comes to the question of management in the era of the current phenomenon. The combination of novelty and diversity surrounding the phenomenon makes how management will look like in this era a topic that requires time and, importantly, well-documented efforts. In contrast, this chapter offers insights that will assist with the creation of answers to the question of management in the era of the current phenomenon. It does so by reflecting on the notion of the label the fourth industrial revolution and the existing yet unnecessary diversity in labels which creates an integration challenge, both of which address terminology, and the multifacets of the phenomenon as well as the topic of workability which are both grouped under the understanding of meaning. But first the understanding of terminology is addressed. Understanding of Terminology Made in China 2025, Make in India, Advanced Manufacturing, Smart Manufacturing, Factories of the Future, Industrial Internet, Industrie 4.0 (translations like Industry, Indústria & Pramonė 4.0), or… Smart Industry. They are all examples of, likely many more, labels that currently exist to highlight a phenomenon that is also often referred to with the term the fourth industrial revolution. Before turning to the apparent diversity, I first want to focus attention on the notion of the fourth industrial revolution. Fourth Industrial Revolution To start, let it be clear that the phenomenon in question can bring about fundamental changes (i.e. be disruptive). From this point of view, the terminology of a fourth industrial revolution is definitely appropriate. However, it is relevant to consider that a revolution is also tied to the concept of speed, as visible in understandings of the word ‘revolution’ – ‘are fast, disruptive and destructive’ (Blanchet, Rinn, Von Thaden, & De Thieulloy, 2014, p. 7) – and the word ‘industrial revolution’, ‘a rapid major change in an economy…’ (‘Industrial Revolution’, n.d.). When one takes this lens into account, the fit appears to become less suitable. The prior sentence includes the word ‘appears’ for, as Madsen (2019) points out, there is ‘relatively little evidence on I4.0 adoption rates in different parts of the world’ (p. 14). In addition, what is considered fast in this context is open to different interpretations. Consequently, a definite outcome regarding the speed of this phenomenon cannot be made. Nonetheless, available data do not hint at the phenomenon being a fast development. For example, in 2016, two years after the introduction of Smart Industry in the Netherlands, only 15% of the respondents in a Dutch survey among entrepreneurs indicated to have heard of the term Smart Industry (Smetsers & Borst, 2017). 1 Within the same survey conducted in 2020, still 72% of the respondents stated to never have heard of the term or, having heard of it but not knowing what it is (Vegter, Witvliet, & Reinhartz, 2020). Though it is possible that companies have Smart Industry elements in place while being unfamiliar with the terminology, this is expected to be an exception rather than the rule; especially with the phenomenon being promoted at national and regional level as well as by platforms such as the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK). The fact that respondents only represent small and medium sized enterprises (SME's), that is companies up to 50 employees, in addition cannot be used as a justification for the results since firms up to 50 employees account for 99% of all Dutch businesses in 2019, according to Statistics Netherlands (CBS) (2021). They make up the bulk of the economy and must therefore be considered when it comes to the speed of the revolution. The mention of barriers for adopting Smart Industry, like lack of time and investment budget, in the 2016 and 2020 survey further signals that the phenomenon does not have the speed associated with a revolution. The presence of barriers even transcends the Netherlands as can be understood from publications like Moktadir, Ali, Kusi-Sarpong, and Shaikh (2018) or Orzes, Rauch, Bednar, and Poklemba (2018). Lastly, results predate COVID-19, excluding it as an explaining factor. To conclude, the phenomenon does not appear to be fast or rapid. Neither should that be a goal in and of itself. Technology needs to serve a purpose, and not be introduced because it is available. However, from a terminology perspective, the applicability of the label fourth industrial revolution can be questioned when adding speed to the equation. From solely a disruption standpoint, the term is understandable. As its predecessors, the term fourth industrial revolution indicates the presence of a major change. Whether we need a separate term to stress this fact, especially with the number four embedded in labels such as Industry 4.0, is another discussion. Diversity of Labels Having addressed the essential distinction in the interpretation of the word revolution, I turn to the existing diversity in labels used to denote the phenomenon. For some labels the overlap with the initial, German terminology Industrie 4.0 is relatively clear and interchangeability can therefore be easily assumed. Other labels are more unique and, as a result, give the impression that the label represents something different; in other words, not related to the Industrie 4.0 phenomenon. But based on the following evidence, the distinction signalled by the use of unique labels can be considered a pretence: You should not bring a German term like Industrie 4.0 to the Netherlands. We don't really like German labels, it must always sound a bit English, and if you give it an original name it seems as if you invented something new. As if you invented it yourself. Then of course it is very smart to call it Smart Industry. (A quote from a Dutch Smart Industry expert; from the study discussed in Habraken & Bondarouk, 2019) Implementing advanced manufacturing technology services/Industry 4.0… (Sentence on the website of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, that is part of the US Department of Commerce 2 ) In response to the recent global reindustrialization tide and Germany's high-tech strategy Industry 4.0, the State Council of China announced the Made-in-China 2025 Plan in May 2015 and Both Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025 focus on the new round of industrial revolution and employ manufacturing digitization, CPS, IoT, and intelligent manufacturing. (Li, 2018, pp. 67–68) The analysis [a systematic literature review of academic studies providing a definition of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts] underlined how very few differences among definitions can actually be explained by the label used to describe the phenomenon. (Culot et al., 2020, p. 9) The diversity with which we are faced with today thus stems from: 1. translations of the original German label into ones native language and a more international applicable, or English, label; 2. a countries desire to create their own label or brand to denote, the countries specific approach regarding, the phenomenon that arose in Germany, and; 3. creations by companies, General Electric for instance promotes the term Industrial Internet (Evans & Annunziata, 2012). These origins are also what make the movement towards the use of a single label complicated. Countries and companies cannot simply change a promotional label which they have heavily invested in. And as long as countries and companies use their labels, so will, in all probability, the academics and consultants embedded within those countries/companies. As Habraken (2020) pointed out, the use of a single label among scholars will therefore only be established if this topic is discussed. An achievement which, given the broadness of the phenomenon (i.e. scholars from a wide range of disciplines are involved), is a challenge in and of itself. As a result, a question that arises is whether the obtainment of one label is of enough importance that it justifies tackling this huge challenge? Or, can we work with the current unnecessary diversity while at the same time reduce expected issues as much as possible, such as a lesser awareness of scholars conducting research in this domain leading to reinventions of the wheel. Though I am in favour of the establishment of a single label, it might be better to work with the situation that has emerged. Not just because of the complexity of the challenge, but also since striving for full awareness of all domain-specific knowledge is in general – thus probably also with a single label – a difficult task to achieve given today's knowledge generation and dissemination age. It, however, does not imply that we should abandon all attempts to improve awareness and integration. To assist this, existing developments like the presence of duplicate key words (i.e. the inclusion of several of the aforementioned labels as distinct key words) could be embraced and used to our advantage. For example, we could agree on counting a certain set of words as a single key word (e.g. to see inclusions like Industry 4.0, Smart Industry and Advanced Manufacturing as one entry). This would allow the retaining of multiple interchangeable labels while facilitating knowledge transfer across diverse labels, without interfering with the limitations, often placed on the available amount of key words. Understanding of Meaning As with the number of labels, diversity is also apparent regarding the description of the phenomenon in question. But the presence of various descriptions cannot be attributed solely to the existence of a multitude of labels. First, there are multiple definitions in existence, offered by both scholars and practitioners, with respect to one label. Take for instance the prevalent label Industry 4.0. In the paper by Culot et al. (2020), it is mentioned that 42 definitions of Industry 4.0 were found in the included academic sources and six definitions in the non-academic sources assessed. Bringing the number of descriptions for the label Industry 4.0 already to 48 based only on papers included in the systematic literature review by Culot et al. (2020). Second, Habraken (2020) showed that the label Smart Industry in the Netherlands has been described differently over time, by one source. Observations that in part are due to new insights, that is, descriptions changed with new knowledge. But another reason lies in the different facets, each containing various elements, that encompass the phenomenon. It, in other words, facilitates the emergence of variations. This presence of multiple facets also explains why the phenomenon is often coined as being ‘broad’ and ‘overarching’. In the next part, I will briefly elaborate on the different facets, using results from the systematic literature review by Culot et al. (2020) and the qualitative study pertaining to Smart Industry by Habraken and Bondarouk (2019). The inclusion of the latter paper stems from its analyses of the term Smart Industry which, despite the vast list of selected terms, was not considered by Culot et al. (2020). I am aware that this incites the question, what about all other related terms that were not incorporated? My intention with the addition was not to cover all existing labels, but rather arose from the use of the term Smart Industry in the title of this book. As a result, it was found to be a relevant inclusion to make. Multiple Facets In the paper by Culot et al. (2020), the notion of the multiple facets becomes evident by the fact that four coding categories were created, or needed, to refer to the constituting elements of the phenomenon: key enabling technologies, other enablers, distinctive characteristics, and possible outcomes. With key enabling technologies, the authors imply the main technological innovations supporting the change, or the technological drivers. Specifically the following 13 elements (not counting the unspecified element) – stated in order of popularity, with the number of observed occurrences indicated in brackets: Internet of Things (84), cloud computing (81), machine learning and artificial intelligence (64), cyber-physical systems (63), simulation and modelling (63), big data analytics (63), interoperability and cybersecurity solutions (62), 3D printing (51), visualization technologies (47), advanced robotics (39), new materials (17), energy management solutions (16), and blockchain technology (11). It is a category that is, in and of itself, broad since the phenomenon does not stem from a development in one domain but rather various fields. In other words, it is ‘not about a single breakthrough invention but comprises several “tech ingredients”…’ (Culot et al., 2020, p. 5). The category other enablers consists of the elements organizational enablers and business model innovation. Regarding the first, the following points are implied: organizational design should pursue higher inter- and intra-organization linkages, organizational structures should flatten out to accommodate distributed decision-making, and digital and strategic capabilities will be needed at all levels (Culot et al., 2020). These factors tie in with aspects that Habraken and Bondarouk (2019) classified under the heading preconditions (e.g. supporting infrastructure, people's ability to adapt and maintain value-adding capability, legislation-related issues). The element business model innovation, in contrast, was stated to be related to the increasing spread of smart products (i.e. products with integrated data-driven services or data-driven services that replace traditional product sales) and new forms of production such as ‘home manufacturing’ due to 3D printing, and offering activities via digital platforms (Culot et al., 2020). Based on this explanation, the element business model innovation appears to fit better under the category distinctive characteristics. The category distinctive characteristics is explained as containing descriptions of ‘how to do Industry 4.0’. Its elements in a sense represent the transitions or developments generated by the key technologies. Examples are process integration, predictability, real-time information transparency, virtual representation of the real world, and autonomy (i.e. self-thinking and/or reacting systems). The distinctive characteristics are portrayed in a more abstract manner by Habraken and Bondarouk (2019), via their three technology-based developmental streams that each contains the notion of digitalization – the establishment of connections, the ability to make more use of the value of information and the availability of contemporary physical and non-physical assets. The category possible outcomes consists of possible impacts of the phenomenon. It overlaps with an extensive set of impacts found by Habraken and Bondarouk (2019). Finally, the results from Habraken and Bondarouk (2019) included the presence of intended rationales. It addresses the intention behind the phenomenon, which was retaining industries competitiveness and alerting industry of emerging opportunities. The fact that multiple facets encompass the phenomenon is visually represented in Fig. 1. With 1A and 1B depicting the frameworks as developed by respectively Culot et al. (2020) and Habraken and Bondarouk (2019). Fig. 1C represents a model that combines insights from both frameworks. Opens in a new window.Fig. 1. Representing the Multiple Facets. 1A, is the framework inspired by Culot et al. (2020); 1B, is the framework by Habraken and Bondarouk (2019); and 1C, is the model developed based on the frameworks presented in 1A and 1B. Having addressed the different facets of the phenomenon, I will now turn to the topic of workability. A Workable Phenomenon The model presented in Fig. 1C cannot be considered a workable description. In other words, something cannot be part of a concept and at the same time facilitate, hinder or result from that concept. In that sense it is more reminiscent of a research field, depicting various directions of interest, than a concept. Removing the presumed interfering categories (rationales, conditions and outcomes), however, still leaves two potential categories. This raises the question of whether a workable construction of the phenomenon is to be understood as the key technologies or the distinctive developments? While there is no definitive answer to this question, I will present my view by taking inspiration from the manner in which the first, second and third industrial revolution are commonly understood. An assessment of the abundant, online industrial revolution diagrams and the mention of these revolutions in the papers by Davies (2015) and Drath and Horch (2014) shows that the main wordings are machination, mass production and automation, accompanied by the notion that these are driven by respectively steam and water power, electrification and the conveyor belt, and electronics and information technologies. Both categories thus also coexist in descriptions of these three industrial revolutions, but the brief reflection shows that emphasis is generally placed on the direction of the transitions or the developments, rather than the underlying technological advancements. Following this line of reasoning, current phenomenon can then be understood as the distinctive developments. Therefore this category will be addressed in more detail below. However, with the phenomenon still unfolding, its content may not be limited to these elements. It thus covers the prominent transitions that can, to date, be attributed to the prior stated key technologies. As a result, especially the key technology ‘energy management solutions’ appears not to be represented. Though, it could be questioned whether this is an issue of time and more insights, or setting boundaries with respect to the key technologies tied to the phenomenon. ‘Energy management solutions’ addresses the sustainability theme, making it potentially more relevant for it to be positioned under the general topic of sustainability. The elements of the phenomenon in question covered here are: Servitization The notion of offering services in itself is not new, but what is visible is an increasing usage of services as a means of building revenue; whether it be in addition to, or as replacement of the original product/value proposition. In their article entitled ‘What is servitization of manufacturing? A quick introduction’, Emerald Publishing Limited (2020) presents five examples, and the following quotes offer two more, respectively from a manufacturer of adapted bicycles, and of winter maintenance vehicles. We developed a business model in which we will develop services as well as products. We are currently working on an app for reading relevant data from the e-bikes; with that information we can organise the service towards the customer in a smarter – preventive – way. (Financial/HRM director at manufacturer of adapted bicycles; in Link Magazine, 2016) From a hardware supplier we become a caretaker with integrated solutions. In doing so, we respond to the megatrends: solutions instead of products, availability instead of ownership. (Director at manufacturer of winter maintenance vehicles; in Link Magazine, 2017) Platform Economy As with servitization, the platform economy is not new. What makes it a noteworthy development is the fact that they are ‘bigger, more virtual, more dynamic, and more intelligent than “platforms” of the past’ (co-author of the book ‘Platform Revolution’; in Manville, 2016). Recent innovations, thus, have led to a growth in and increased attention for the platform economy. The statement more intelligent, in the prior quote, indicates a connection with the next element (data usage), as explained with the following quotes: Platforms win, not just by facilitating such new interactions [e.g. joining more producers and customers], but also by aggregating and analysing the data of it all (Manville, 2016) and The explosion of data, and its use by platform businesses to keep learning is perhaps most significant. Uber, for example, is not just matching rides to travelers, but increasingly predicting and even structuring demand by algorithms that rebalance supply of available cars. (Co-author of the book ‘Platform Revolution’; in Manville, 2016) Data Usage Combine the vast and varied amount of (real-time) data that can now be collected and the different (new) ways in which data can be processed, with the notion that done purposefully there is value to be gained from data and the core of this element becomes clear – data can and are used more frequently for various reasons. From monitoring, understanding and decision-making (take for instance the Covid-19 situation) to prediction, as shown via the following examples: A smart factory with machines that are packed with sensors that measure productivity. They keep track of everything: process values, alarms, vision control images, temperature, humidity, energy consumption, failure, malfunctions, logs, checklists, etc. … The ultramodern injection molding factory that K. is now building has been developed entirely according to the Industry 4.0 concept. A factory that constantly monitors the condition of the machines, predicts maintenance and generates the big data with which it can produce more efficiently. (Verpakkingsmanagement, 2017) The robotic system provides a flow of data as well as milk, [this data flow is used] to keep track of the best producers and the cows that may eventually have to be culled. ‘We've got seven cows out of 113 that we're looking at’, Jim Austin said, as he pointed to the red bars lighting up an office computer screen. (Boyle, 2016) Another reason is traceability, for instance, to offer customers details about the path taken by products like food. A chapter in the book entitled ‘Blockchain chicken farm: And other stories of tech in China's countryside’ (Wang, 2020) presents a relevant case example. The improvement of services, for instance in the healthcare and tourism sector (Benjelloun, Lahcen, & Belfkih, 2015), is an additional reason that can be observed. The link between utilizing data and services is also evident in the above element of servitization since the manufacturer of winter maintenance vehicles is able to focus on availability instead of ownership by gaining insights into the deployment of their vehicles; ‘the firm has equipped their grit and salt spreaders with a controller that offers up-to-date information, accessible through a web application, on performance aspects, such as spreading quantities, and on service aspects such as usage in hours or kilometres driven’ (Habraken & Bondarouk, 2020, p. 7). Finally, a link with the next element can be made as ‘autonomous’ systems utilize data to function. To illustrate, autonomous mobile vehicles (AMV) are not restricted to fixed routes but navigate dynamically due to a blueprint of a location and live input of their surrounding (Fetch Robotics, 2018). To conclude, the element data usage can be seen as a standalone element leading to an increased focus on predicting, monitoring, assisted decision-making, etc. In addition, it ties to several of the other elements. ‘Autonomous’ Systems A fourth development is the presence of ‘independent’ systems. The brackets around the word independent are included to highlight that systems are more autonomic than before, but often still require human involvement, for instance, to assist it with dealing with changes in the environment or human-made errors in the systems input. In other words, full autonomy is not really the case yet. Autonomous systems can range from being interpreted as autonomous devices like the above AMV and the milking robot from an earlier example (Boyle, 2016). But it can also be understood as people-light processes. An example is given with the quote from a supplier of sheet metal: To do this [people-light process from order to production], you must be able to recognise a customer's drawing, convert it into a quotation using software, then automatically have the right materials removed from the warehouse, have it processed, packaged, etc. (Van Ede, 2015) The example highlights an autonomous process from customers to production. Firms could, however, extended it towards suppliers (e.g. autonomous ordering of parts) as well as decide to introduce a smaller scaled autonomous system. Human-Robot Interaction As Bartneck et al. (2020, p. 6) point out, ‘the notion of human interaction with robots has been around as long as the notion of robots themselves’. What makes this development important now is that robots have moved beyond merely being a tool, to being an interaction partner in numerous ways. The AMV can be considered an example here as it interacts with people in order to not run into them. More examples of human-robot interaction applications are addressed by Bartneck et al. (2020, Chapter 2), with some of the discussed types being: service robots (e.g. tour guides, receptionist, delivery or security robots); robots for entertainment; robots in healthcare and therapy (e.g. for senior citizens or rehabilitation); collaborative robot (co-bot) arms; and remotely operated robots. An example of a remotely operated robot are drones, when interpreted in terms of moving sensors (i.e. scanning or mapping a terrain or conducting inspection work). But drones can also be classified as delivery robots as shown by the following headline from a news article by Palmer (2020) – ‘Amazon wins FAA approval for Prime Air drone delivery fleet’. Reconfiguration As the word reconfiguration implies, this development is focused on the ability to rearrange settings, or the ease with which diverse outputs can be created. A well-known approach is additive manufacturing or 3D printing. This approach is featured in the quotes be","['reflections', 'understanding', 'smart', 'industry']"
Editorial and News,2020,"Although the UK food sector is currently facing major challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic (p24) and the approaching deadline for our departure from the EU, it must continue to focus on the implementation of actions, technologies and policies that will allow it to meet demanding climate change targets by 2050. Taking our eye off the ball could result in severe global consequences, such as excessive temperature increases, further loss of biodiversity and more extreme weather events damaging crops and livelihoods. Our September issue highlights recent work in the food and climate change arena. For the food industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, there needs to be a major focus on decarbonisation of energy used for heating. This may be achieved by a move to electrification and more efficient heating technologies, for example microwave heating and heat pumps, as well as the use of biogas and hydrogen to replace natural gas (p24). Investment funding in new ventures is helping to promote lower carbon technologies to reduce emissions, for example by generating energy from manure, using nanotechnology to increase crop yields while reducing carbon inputs, and replacing pesticides with biological control methods (p34). Life cycle analysis in key sectors of the food and drink industry will help to identify stages in the production and supply chain at which reductions in emissions can be achieved (p30). Modelling studies on future diets indicate that we need to reduce meat consumption and increase plant-based diets in order to mitigate climate change (p43). Sustainable nutrition is an approach that aims to enhance planetary and human health simultaneously by adopting a number of strategies including reduced consumption of meat, reducing food waste, regenerating agricultural land and eating local and seasonal food (p38). One way to reduce meat consumption gradually is the introduction of hybrid plant and meat products to the diet (p48). email mb@biophase.co.uk Letters to the editor about any of the articles published in Food Science and Technology are welcomed. The Government has released a new policy paper on ‘Tackling obesity: empowering adults and children to live healthier lives’1. The paper explains that we have known for decades that living with obesity reduces life expectancy and increases the chance of serious diseases, however, in the last few months it has become clear that being overweight or obese increases the risk of dying from COVID-19. In addition, the paper points out that obesity puts pressure on the NHS. It is estimated that overweight and obesity related conditions across the UK are costing the NHS £6.1bn each year. The latest figures show there were nearly 900,000 obesity related hospital admissions in 2018 to 2019. Excess weight is one of the few modifiable factors for COVID-19 and so the Government will be taking the following actions in a drive to reduce obesity: • introducing a new campaign – a call to action for everyone who is overweight to take steps to move towards a healthier weight, with evidence-based tools and apps with advice on how to lose weight and keep it off • working to expand weight management services available through the NHS, so more people get the support they need to lose weight • publishing a 4-nation public consultation to gather views and evidence on the current ‘traffic light’ label to help people make healthy food choices • introducing legislation to require large out-of-home food businesses, including restaurants, cafes and takeaways with more than 250 employees, to add calorie labels to the food they sell • consulting on its intention to make companies provide calorie labelling on alcohol • legislating to end the promotion of foods high in fat, sugar or salt (HFSS) by restricting volume promotions, such as buy one get one free, and the placement of these foods in prominent locations intended to encourage purchasing, both online and in physical stores in England • banning the advertising of HFSS products being shown on TV and online before 9pm and holding a short consultation as soon as possible on how to introduce a total HFSS advertising restriction online. Part one of the National Food Strategy, led by co-founder of the Leon Restaurants, Henry Dimbleby, has been published. It is the first independent review of the UK's food policy in nearly 75 years2. It contains urgent recommendations to support the UK through the turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to prepare for the end of the EU exit transition period on 31 December 2020. It makes recommendations to ensure firstly that a generation of the most disadvantaged children do not get left behind and secondly that the UK grasps the opportunity to decide the kind of trading nation it wants to be. The report concludes that the legacy of COVID-19 is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment, poverty and hunger; the effects of hunger on children are serious and long-lasting, and exacerbate social inequalities. It proposes that the Government must move quickly to shore up the diets of the most deprived children using existing, proven mechanisms. Recommendations include expanding the eligibility for the Free School Meal scheme, extending the Holiday Activity and Food Programme, extending the work of the Food to the Vulnerable Ministerial Task Force and increasing the value of Healthy Start vouchers to £4.25 per week. The CEOs of the Co-op and Waitrose have agreed, in principle, to supplement these vouchers with additional free fruit and vegetables. Most of the other major supermarkets and convenience stores are keen to follow suit. The report points out that Britain's exit from the EU means that, for the first time in nearly half a century, we can decide how we want to trade with the rest of the world. UK farmers and food producers have some of the highest environmental and animal welfare standards in the world. It suggests that there is justifiable concern about opening up our markets to cheaper, low-standard imports, which would undercut our own producers and make a nonsense of our progressive farming policies. Any blanket legislation requiring other countries to meet our own food guidelines is considered unlikely to succeed. We already import many food products from the EU that do not meet UK standards. A blanket ban would make it impossible to continue trading even with this most closely aligned of partners. The report recommends that the Government should only agree to cut tariffs in new trade deals on products which meet our core standards. Verification programmes, similar to those currently operated by the US Department of Agriculture to enable American farmers to sell non-hormone-treated beef to the EU, should be established so that producers wishing to sell into the UK market can prove they meet these minimum standards. At a minimum, these certification schemes should cover animal welfare concerns and environmental and climate concerns where the impact of particular goods are severe (for example, beef reared on land recently cleared of rainforest). The scope of the impact assessment should include: economic productivity; food safety and public health; the environment and climate change; society and labour; human rights; and animal welfare. The report would be presented alongside a government response when any final trade treaty is laid before parliament. The report goes on to suggest that the Government should adopt a statutory duty to give Parliament the time and opportunity to properly scrutinise any new trade deal. It must allow time for relevant select committees to produce reports on any final deal and allow a debate in the House of Commons. Part Two of the National Food Strategy will be published in 2021; it will analyse the economics and power dynamics of the food system, together with its benefits and harms. More detailed analysis is promised on health, climate change, biodiversity, pollution, antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic diseases and sustainable use of resources. The Government is to provide £12m funding to help launch an innovative high-tech food manufacturing campus in Derby, which will create up to 4,500 jobs and further employment in the supply chain throughout the local region whilst providing a sustainable, low-cost production base for food manufacturers4. It is expected to play a crucial role in the UK's broader recovery strategy and to reboot Derby's economy following the coronavirus crisis. The campus will include a shared energy plant, designed to reduce energy consumption by 30%, and plans to harness the latest technology to improve production efficiency, lowering costs by 20%. It will also embrace the latest scientific developments, such as vertical farming – where crops are grown indoors in stacked layers, mitigating the vagaries of the weather and eliminating the need for pesticides. A central distribution facility will allow manufacturers to consolidate both raw materials and finished goods, improving efficiency and lowering food miles. Work will start in the first quarter of 2021 and a planned opening will take place later that year. Full project realisation is expected by 2024. Scientists at Campden BRI have developed and validated a new test to assess the effectiveness of cleaning chemicals and cleaning practices on a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus5. With rigorous cleaning regimens regarded as vital in reducing virus transmission, the new test will provide companies with greater confidence in their abilities to clean effectively. It involves the use of a safe ‘surrogate’ virus and is classified at biosafety level one (BSL-1), which means it is safe to handle in a range of environments. Recent research has suggested that Phi6 is an appropriate surrogate for infectious enveloped viruses like coronavirus and influenza virus and so this was chosen as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Structurally this virus particle is very similar to SARS-CoV-2 - they are both about 100nm, they have a lipid (fatty) envelope and their genes are made of RNA. Phi6 is a virus that infects the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, it does not infect plants or animals, including humans. The test can be used by companies which want to compare the efficacy of different sanitisers or assess the effectiveness of their surface cleaning regimes. Because the surrogate is safe, it can be used to test for virus in factories, shops, hotels, restaurants, pubs, offices, warehouses and even on people's hands. Thirty-eight of the UK's largest producers, processors and retailers of meat have signed up to a new initiative known as ‘Meat in a Net Zero world’, developed under Courtauld Commitment 2025 and facilitated by WRAP3. Approximate scale of food waste and GHG emissions at different stages in the meat supply chain WRAP estimates that each year around 380,000 tonnes of meat intended for consumption goes uneaten, with the GHG emissions associated with this uneaten meat measuring more than 4m tonnes of CO2 equivalents. Much of this meat is discarded in the home, but there are important actions to take at all points along the supply chain. A dedicated Meat Sector Working Group was convened by WRAP under Courtauld 2025 that brought together key stakeholders to identify the areas of biggest impact and opportunities to overcome barriers and avoid moving problems along the supply chain. Meat in a Net Zero world aims to prevent more than 150,000 tonnes of meat worth £1.5bn from ending up as waste each year and to make an important contribution to the UK's target to bring all GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. The first step is to agree and adopt a consistent approach for measuring GHG emissions and common metrics that can be used within each sector (beef, sheep, pigs and poultry). These tasks will be addressed through the Meat Sector Working Group in combination with other industry forums. The initiative is supported by key trade bodies including the National Farmers Union (NFU), Agriculture and Horticultural Development Board (AHDB), the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), the British Poultry Council (BPC), the British Retail Consortium (BRC), Hybu Cig Cymru (HCC), the National Pig Association (NPA), Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) and the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA). Meat in a Net Zero world will help deliver against a number of industry initiatives including the NFU's Net Zero vision, the European Roundtable for Beef Sustainability/UK Cattle Sustainability Platform and the UK Roundtable on Sustainable Soya. Greater collaboration will also help accelerate progress towards achieving targets set out in Courtauld 2025 and the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 to halve per capita food waste by 2030. WRAP aims to ensure participating companies are held to account by publicly reporting on progress. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) between the University of Bradford and Rakusens Ltd, a Leedsbased, independent, kosher food manufacturer, was rated outstanding by Innovate UK and has been shortlisted for a KTP Best of the Best Award in the Engineering Excellence Category7. The company was experiencing large variations in product quality, taste and texture, which made it impossible to have a flexible planning process that allowed the company to achieve its full potential. The KTP project transformed production knowledge into a smart manufacturing process using artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, cloud computing and ‘industrial internet of things’ to produce consistent quality food products. The University team comprising Dr Savas Konur and Dr Yang Lan in the Faculty of Engineering & Informatics developed an intelligent process control system to harvest live data and monitor the production processes to achieve product consistency. This smart production approach transformed the company into a technology driven enterprise and allowed Rakusens to move over to the latest technology without the need to change its traditional machinery. By doing this, they preserved the manufacturing standards required of kosher tradition alongside expanding their production capacity. By replacing the centralised manual decision making with an intelligent computational decentralised modular system, the platform provides a smart control facility fulfilling the factory's strategic target on the production capacity and consistency. This project has allowed a highly traditional food manufacturing company still using machinery more than a hundred years old has moved over to industry. Production line at Rakusens Source: University of Bradford The Food standards agency (FSA) has published updated technical guidance for allergen labelling following changes for pre-packed for direct sale food6. These changes, which are now enshrined in legislation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, will come into effect from 1 October 2021; they complement existing labelling rules on providing allergen information to consumers. The changes were introduced after an earlier UK-wide consultation following the death of teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse as a result of an allergic reaction to sesame in a baguette she had eaten. 15-17 September, VITAFOODS VIRTUAL SUMMIT Venue online Web vitafoods.eu.com/virtualexpo/home.html 7-8 October 2020, VIRTUAL 1ST GLOBAL PLANTBASED FOODS & PROTEINS RESEARCH CONFERENCE Venue online Web bridge2food.com/webinars/virtual-1st-global-plant-based-foods-proteins-research-conference-2020/ 12-14 October, 2020 FOOD TECH MATTERS Venue online Web foodtechmatters.com/ 10-12 November 2020, 34TH EFFOST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE Venue online Web effost.org/effost+international+conference/34th+effost+international+conference+2020/default.aspx 19-21 November 2020, ICN2 SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NUTRITION Venue Rome, Italy Web fao.org/about/meetings/icn2/en/ 1-3 December 2020, FOOD INGREDIENTS EUROPE Venue Frankfurt, Germany Web figlobal.com/fieurope/en/home.html 6-9 December 2020, 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY – ACHIEVING LOCAL AND GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY: AT WHAT COSTS?

Reflections on the status and future of continuous professional development: Scandinavian anesthesiologists' view,2024,"Continuous professional development routines and preferences, as well as formal requirements, differ from country to country. In this report from a workshop on continuous professional development activities in the specialty in the Nordic countries, the current conditions and opportunities are described, and future goals are proposed. Continuous professional development (CPD) refers to the ongoing process by which healthcare professionals maintain, refine, and broaden their knowledge, skills, and competencies throughout their careers. CPD is essential for safe patient care. A recent systematic review revealed significant variations in both the requirements for CPD and the methods used to evaluate the outcome of CPD.1 In certain countries, participation in formal activities and registration of CME (Continuous Medical Education) points are mandatory, whereas in others the national medical associations only recommend participation in activities often with 10–15 days paid leave provided by the employer.2, 3 The responsibility for planning these activities varies, but is often shared between the individual and the head of department.4 Recent publications have addressed the need for healthcare professionals to become lifelong learners.5 The technological evolution and introduction of artificial intelligence make it necessary to be able to understand and apply this in a clinical setting. Another argument for learning for life is that our cognitive function decreases with age as well as our ability to see own incompetence, as we often work alone without receiving feedback.6, 7 The Scandinavian approach to CPD has been based on mutual trust and common goals of the employer and employee. A need for more formalized CPD programs and documentation of activities has so far not been recognized. In specialist training, however, there has been a paradigm shift toward goal-, and competence-oriented training, including learning and evaluation of competence in a clinical setting.8, 9 The question is whether we should promote a similar paradigm shift in CPD beyond specialist training.10 The healthcare systems in our countries are primarily public and are confronted with many common challenges such as a rising demand for services and an increasing shortage of healthcare professionals. The financial resources allocated to CPD are limited, necessitating the exploration of alternative educational approaches. A shared approach to CPD in our countries could pave the way forward. The first step was to bring anesthesiologists from all five Scandinavian countries together to discuss the future of CPD. The overall aim was to present the status of CPD in the Scandinavian countries, discuss the future of CPD for anesthesiologists, and develop a roadmap for planning and monitoring this development. The Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care's (SSAI) Educational Committee has supported the development of advanced subspecialty training programs for anesthesiologists over the years. A new focus area for the committee is how to support CPD in general. At the request of the committee, a working group consisting of one to two members from each Scandinavian country was established. The members were appointed by their national societies in 2023. Online meetings were held to gather information concerning the status of CPD in the countries and to prepare for a workshop in January 2024 in Malmö, Sweden. The workshop was supported by a grant from the Acta Foundation. A 1½ day program was sent to all participants in advance (Appendix A). After the welcome and introduction, participants wrote down their expectations for the workshop and shared this in plenum. The program included the following topics: the present status of CPD, an overview of the literature about CPD, goals and objectives for CPD, educational strategies, assessment of competence, implementation issues, and future research areas. Each topic was introduced with a 10–15 min presentation followed by group discussions. Notes were written on a flipchart (DØ and OT) and then condensed and recorded by CS. The notes were read by all participants. Eight participants were invited by the Educational Committee of the SSAI, representing five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). All were specialists in anesthesiology, representing different levels of experience. The expectations of participants included defining the goals of CPD, identifying CPD activities, proposing ideas for implementation, and creating a defined plan that could be of benefit to anesthesiologists, organizations, and patients. In addition, the participants emphasized the importance of SSAI's potential to expand beyond the scope of the National Societies by envisioning collaborative outcomes such as shared recommendations, which could serve as a road map for CPD across our nations. An overview of the existing specialist education revealed that each country has or is building a competence-based framework requiring documentation of competence through a logbook or portfolio. Some countries have adapted the CanMED seven roles of the physician and others have adapted only some of these.11 In all countries, clinical training is complemented with courses. In Iceland, the European Diploma (EDAIC) part 1 should be passed during the first 2 years of training, whereas in Finland and Sweden, the EDAIC or a similar national exam should be passed during the training period. In Norway and Sweden, national courses involve exams or tests of knowledge, while in Denmark two of the courses include an Objective Structured Clinical Examination to inform the trainee of their level of competence. The current state of CPD in the five countries showed many similarities. In general, the recommendations from the national medical associations are similar concerning the number of days for CPD, with 10–15 days of activities paid for by the employer recommended each year. In addition, Norway has 2.2 days of paid leave earned per month, resulting in 4 months every 5 years. In addition, the Finnish and Icelandic Medical Associations recommend 5 and 1 h per week, respectively, during usual working hours. The financial responsibility for, and the actual availability of the required activities differ between countries: a common problem is that it has become increasingly difficult to allocate 10 days for CPD and national surveys indicate that 5 days is more common. The pros and cons of more formalized CPD programs were discussed, including national experiences of portfolio systems encompassing workplace-based assessments and feedback in specialist training. Based on the literature and positive experience from specialist training, the workshop participants suggested continuing competency-based educational activities for specialist anesthesiologists, including a portfolio representing competence within several of the seven CanMED roles.11 The anesthesiologist must be a lifelong learner, which implies maintaining basic skills, refining specific skills, and learning new skills such as point-of-care ultrasound or videolaryngoscopy. The knowledge and skills needed are determined by the demands anesthesiologist's current clinical practice. Examples are shown in Table 1. There was unanimous agreement that this involves a broader perspective on competence beyond merely being a medical expert: social skills including communication, collaboration, and leadership, and cognitive skills such as situational awareness and decision-making. Scholarly and research activities were also mentioned as important. In addition, there was acknowledgment of the importance of taking responsibility for one's mental well-being and supporting others in this regard. The good listener. Openminded for input from the team. Knowing not to speak—and when to speak up. Coordination of complex tasks. Multiple contact during daily work. Involved in multiple specialties. Pivotal role/responsibility in a team of experts and different professionals. Lobbying, advocacy, campaign contributions, or the direct involvement of professionals in politics. Influence of the specialty on the hospital system. Governance, departmental leadership. Overview, have an overview of the situation. Diagnostic thinking. Ability to act within the span of new and few information, start making decisions. Re-evaluation. Dynamic thinking and problem-solving. Ability to change. Dynamic tempo. ""From coffee to emergency."" Things happening/you do things. Pattern recognition. System 1 – System 2. Capability to transition between the systems Emergency preparedness for infrequent but rare or mass-casualty effect. Being able to receive feedback from both more junior or senior colleagues as well as interprofessional feedback (ability and openness for learning). Openness for blind spots, learning from failures. Societal obligations. Responsibility for prioritization. Adjusting to younger generation. Attracting new doctor. Recruitment. Sustainable post-graduate education. Attractive careers. Flexibility. Conflict handling—big and small. Resources. Ethical issues. Following the development. Moving boundaries. Expectations to the anesthesiologist. Doing the right thing and—stop at the right level of expertise. Healthy working environment. Sustainable work-life balance. Accepting/respecting the different phases of life. The happy doctor, growth, inspiration, feeling competent. Mentoring. The participants suggested and discussed a wide range of educational methods, some of which should be mandatory each year. In addition to courses and conferences, more informal and frequent meetings nearer the workplace were discussed, including intercollegiate and interprofessional meetings, peer-to-peer feedback, and journal clubs. Simulation, online teaching, tactical decision games, and skill stations were also covered, some of which the participants thought should be mandatory each year. Simulation may be carried out both in situ, and at simulation centers depending on whether the aim is to involve the actual team and local environment, or to bring together participants from several specialties and departments, fostering discussions and stimulating team reflexivity on current practices as recommended by Schmutz and Kolbe.12, 13 Training for emergency situations should be included. Exchange programs between hospitals or departments were mentioned. Activities such as teaching, updating routines and guidelines, participation in quality improvement, and research projects were all seen as relevant CPD. Feedback constitutes an important part of workplace-based learning. In contrast to the instructional feedback provided when novices are supervised, a more reflective form of feedback is required to engage specialists. We recognize that giving and receiving feedback from colleagues (peer-to-peer feedback) can be difficult. The feedback provider must be genuinely curious as to why someone has chosen a particular approach to understand the mental model behind the action. This is in alignment with previous publications.14-16 The structure for debriefing after simulation-based training and being open-minded using curious questions can be applied to the clinical situation. The purpose is to benefit from the feedback, and often both the provider and receiver learn from the situation. For this to happen, the individual needs to feel psychologically safe and a learning culture should be fostered.17 The participants suggested that departmental training courses focusing on giving feedback might be necessary, allowing individuals to practice reflection techniques to make the transition to workplace-based learning successful. Prior to engaging in any educational activity, it is advisable to discuss the objectives: What do I aim to gain personally from this activity, and how can my colleagues and department benefit in terms of team and organizational learning? The SMART concept was mentioned, the abbreviation stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.18 This method is beneficial as it visualizes what is gained from educational activities. This is aligned with the idea of grounding future CPD systems in everyday activities.19, 20 The participants briefly discussed whether certification of certain tasks should be mandatory but did not go into details about this topic. Overall, the participants favored identifying gaps and peaks in professional performance by workplace-based learning and assessment over collecting CME points and formal re-certification. The workshop participants proposed some overall concepts for anesthesiologists' CPD in the Scandinavian Countries. Based on the literature and the positive experience from specialist training, it was proposed to develop a portfolio system with documentation of competency-based educational activities for specialists to support life-long learning. The CPD activities should be tailored to the anesthesiologist's clinical responsibilities. Supporting work-place-based learning includes training specialists to seek and provide reflective feedback, which involves promoting and preserving a psychologically safe environment for learning. A wide variety of learning methods could be used to address learning needs. Compulsory theoretical exams were not seen as a way forward, yet certain competencies may necessitate annual or biannual assessment. The suggested approach to CPD agrees with a paradigm shift in medical education toward more formalized workplace-based learning. In the following, we address the potential challenges and how the local and national societies and the SSAI can support such a paradigm shift in CPD. One important barrier to change can be that anesthesiologists might not believe in the need for CPD. To overcome this challenge, anesthesiologists must understand the need for change and be motivated to become lifelong learners. It is important to understand that it is meant as a way to refine existing skills and acquire new skills. Healthcare providers should recognize that CPD ensures a highly professional, competent, and resilient workforce capable of addressing both present and future challenges. Managers might not see the need for the above-mentioned mix of educational strategies, and some might have financial challenges in supporting the CPD activities. By investing in CPD initiatives, we enhance anesthesiologists' individual competencies with the intention of improving patient safety, outcomes, and the well-being of anesthesiologists. CPD should be anchored in the department and activities should be decided in dialogue with leadership. An example of a structure for a CPD conversation is seen in Appendix B. CPD is seen as a responsibility for both the individual and leadership. Local CPD activities should be in alignment with national or Scandinavian recommendations. Heads of department should be encouraged to engage in a dialogue with anesthesiologists, and to have a balanced perspective that addresses both short- and long-term individual and departmental needs. Financial constraints might inspire or force us to use new formats such as online learning. A national structure is necessary to support the development of educational methods and of an electronic version of the portfolio to be able to share CPD activity data. The SSAI has a history of organizing common post-graduate programs serving our aligned interests and goals. With a longstanding tradition of collaboration, the SSAI is well-equipped to facilitate the further development of CPD in the Scandinavian countries. Our workshop has illustrated that specialist training is based on the similar educational principles and that we could extend some of these principles for CPD. Our specialty is organized the same way and our cultures are alike. We find that the SSAI could facilitate the practical steps needed with respect to Medical Unions and authorities. CPD activities are the responsibility of SSAI's Educational Committee, and we suggest continuing the work initiated by this workshop. A first step could be collaborative, Scandinavian research projects testing some of these suggestions in practice before implementation. There are questions to be answered before such a paradigm shift can take place. How can we address the differences in ""in house"" CPD opportunities for larger and smaller departments? What type of support is required to facilitate workplace-based learning? Do anesthesiologists feel sufficiently psychologically safe to engage in peer-to-peer feedback and do they need training in promoting reflective feedback? What are the key elements that need to be in place for successful implementation? We do not have the answers to these questions but recommend initiating explorative studies addressing these questions to facilitate the implementation of workplace-based learning. The take-home messages from this study are seen in Table 2. The strength of this study is that the workshop was conducted with anesthesiologists with different levels of seniority from all the Scandinavian countries. The drawback is that only eight anesthesiologists participated in the workshop, which might question the generalizability. The strength is that the outcome of the meeting is in line with the educational literature and conceptual frameworks. We found that there is room for improvement in the way we structure CPD in the Scandinavian countries. It was proposed to develop a portfolio-based system tailored to the individual anesthesiologist to document competency-based activities, and to facilitate reflective practice and feedback. We suggest expanding our collaboration from the post-graduate programs to CPD. Potential challenges and unanswered questions need to be addressed to facilitate changes. Research projects are needed to explore leaders' and specialists' views on CPD activities, including how we can prepare for the future in departments with different challenges, setting new objectives, and using new methods. In addition, collecting experiences with workplace-based learning and reflective feedback for CPD would be beneficial. All authors participated in the workshop and provided input to the paper.

Day 1 12.00–13.00 Lunch Day 2 12.00–13.00 Lunch 14.00–14.15 Rounding and evaluation Surgery and Intensive Care Clinic Development plan for specialists in anaesthesiology Applies to all physicians in full- and part-time positions at the Department of Anaesthesiology, UNN. This plan is a personal document shared between you and your manager. The document is stored in your personnel folder. Part 1—Document between you and your manager. Sharing and discussing with your immediate colleagues is encouraged. Part 2—Document between you and the manager. The plan is completed by you and sent to your manager well in advance of your annual development meeting. This meeting is a confidential discussion between you and the immediate manager and replaces the traditional performance appraisal. The purpose of the development meeting is to establish a common understanding of your priorities and goals for the coming period. In addition, the conversation should be an arena for mutual feedback and clarification of matters that may affect you as a co-worker in terms of development and goal attainment. The plan should be a living document that is adjusted annually, or more often if there is a need/desire from one of the parties. Responsibility for following up any agreements made is shared by manager and employee alike, how this is to be done for different measures is clarified and noted in the document. If you find it challenging to complete part 2 (collaboration and working environment) prior to the meeting, this can be done during or after the meeting. After the development meeting, revise the document and send it over to your manager. Continuous overview of courses, conferences, secondments, etc. In this section, you can discuss everything from collaboration at all levels to how you think interactions with your manager works. Furthermore, it is important to cover the working environment—what is the culture like in your department? You can address both the physical and psychosocial working environment. Do you think you get the opportunity to participate and how much influence do you have? How do you contribute to the working environment—what can you do yourself? Have there been any changes that entail a need for adaptations? The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.","['reflections', 'status', 'future', 'continuous', 'professional', 'development:', 'scandinavian', ""anesthesiologists'"", 'view']"

Editorial and News,2018,"Our theme for March is new sources of protein for human food and animal feed. With the global population increasing and the rise of the middle classes, demand for meat is growing rapidly. There is an imperative need to find alternative, more sustainable sources of protein, such as vegetables, algae, microorganisms, insects and cell cultured meat, which use less ecosystem resources and less land. Conventional sources of protein will not be adequate to meet the demands of the growing global population. Insect protein has already begun to appear in human foods and research is underway to identify optimum species and production conditions (p18, p22). Insect protein also offers the potential to provide new functional ingredients for foods, with the ability to generate, for example, gels, emulsions and foams (p26). While in many eastern countries, insects are appreciated as delicacies, in western countries the adverse response to eating insects must be overcome if we are to provide sufficient protein for the future population. Aquaculture has been expanding to meet protein requirements, with fish being more efficient at retaining carbon and energy from feed than livestock (p26). The high cost of conventional animal feeds, such as soybean and fishmeal, is increasing the demand for new protein sources for feed. Insect protein is showing highly promising characteristics in terms of nutritional value and environmental footprint for both livestock farming and aquaculture, offering the potential to use waste feedstocks (p22, p26). Algae are also appearing as an alternative to fishmeal (p26) and as a source of protein for human nutrition – they are being offered as high protein snack bars (p36). Innovative research has identified a compound that is important in the production of meat flavour and this has led to the development of an alternative route for producing the compound using yeast fermentation (p32). As a result, a vegetarian burger has been launched in the US that looks and tastes like meat. It is likely that many of these different protein sources will increasingly contribute to future human and livestock diets. In this issue, we are introducing a new section on Brexit viewpoints (p16), in which individuals across the food sector will contribute opinions about the impact and planning of Brexit. Please get in touch with me if you are interested in contributing to this section. email mb@biophase.co.uk Food consumption will need to change to improve consumer health: • A decrease in the consumption of animal protein could be important for both health and the environment. • Policy-makers should tackle the perverse price incentives to consume high-calorie diets and introduce new incentives for affordable nutrition. • More clarity is needed about how to measure sustainability related to consumption of healthy diets. • Sources of food contamination must be characterised to tackle food safety concerns. • European countries must commit to collection of more robust data on waste in food systems and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce waste. Farming and agriculture have significant impacts on human health and the environment: • A revamp of the Common Agricultural Policy is required to focus on financing innovation rather than providing subsidies to farmers. • Europe's dependence on food and animal feed imports increases its footprint in many developing countries that will be most affected by climate change and environmental degradation. Work is needed to better understand market volatility and fair trade, and to increase resilience. • Changes to livestock management practices (e.g. sustainable intensification of production) could contribute to GHG mitigation. • Research is needed on increasing consumer acceptance of alternatives to traditional forms of animal protein, such as food from the oceans, lab-grown meat and insects. • The potential for meat that is cultured in vitro to have a lower environmental impact than livestock must be examined. • More effort is needed to understand the functions of soil in carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Europe should not stall on opportunities offered by genome editing, precision agriculture and the use of large data sets: • European policy-makers should capitalise on the scientific advances in genomics for animal and crop health and productivity. • Wild gene pools need to be protected and characterised. • Large data sets should be used to support innovation throughout the food system, for example in precision agriculture, and prepare for risk and uncertainty. Underpinning the scientists’ recommendations is a clear call to integrate research and innovation across the disciplines into all of these topics, where many questions remain from a scientific perspective. The report concludes that Europe must capitalise on opportunities to co-design research to understand better the relationship between food, water and ecosystem services. It recommends being more ambitious in identifying scientific opportunities to shape understanding of both supply- and demand-side challenges. ■ Food business operators (FBOs) in the UK will be required to put in place practical steps to manage acrylamide within their food safety management systems under new EU legislation which will apply from April 2018[2]. The legislation describes practical measures based upon best practice, mitigation measures and benchmark levels for the reduction of acrylamide in food. Acrylamide forms naturally during high temperature cooking and processing, such as frying, roasting and baking, particularly in potato-based products and cereal-based products. It is not possible to eliminate acrylamide from foods, but actions can be taken to try and ensure that acrylamide levels are as low as reasonably achievable. Mitigation methods have been drawn from the various codes of practice that have been developed by various sector specific trade bodies who have investigated how to reduce acrylamide in different foods. Benchmark levels are generic performance indicators for the food categories covered by the Regulation. They are not maximum limits and are not intended to be used for enforcement purposes. Industry guidance has been developed by various food sectors at national and EU level, including the acrylamide tool box maintained by Food Drink Europe. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) are working with the British Hospitality Association (BHA) and other trade associations to develop a best practice guide for FBOs in the catering and foodservice industry. This is expected to be finalised and available from the BHA in early 2018. The FSA is also developing guidelines to assist local authorities in the implementation and enforcement of the new requirements. Food Business Operators will be expected to: • Be aware of acrylamide as a food safety hazard and have a general understanding of how acrylamide is formed in the food they produce • Take the necessary steps to mitigate acrylamide formation in the food they produce, adopting the relevant measures as part of their food safety management procedures • Undertake representative sampling and analysis where appropriate, to monitor the levels of acrylamide in their products as part of their assessment of the mitigation measures • Keep appropriate records of the mitigation measures undertaken, together with sampling plans and results of any testing. The measures are intended to be proportionate to the nature and size of the business, to ensure that small and micro-businesses are not burdened. The new legislation applies to all FBOs that produce or place on the market the following foods: • French fries, other cut (deep fried) products and sliced potato crisps from fresh potatoes • Potato crisps, snacks, crackers and other potato products from potato dough • Bread • Breakfast cereals (excluding porridge) • Fine bakery wares: cookies, biscuits, rusks, cereal bars, scones, cornets, wafers, crumpets and gingerbread, as well as crackers, crisp breads and bread substitutes • Coffee: (i) roast coffee (ii) instant (soluble) coffee • Coffee substitutes • Baby food and processed cereal-based food intended for infants and young children. Different requirements apply to local and independent FBOs selling food directly to the consumer or directly into local retail, for example, independent cafes, fish and chip shops and restaurants. For larger centrally controlled and supplied chains with standardised menus and operating procedures, the controls of acrylamide can be managed from the centre. ■ The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) commenced a programme of unannounced inspections to review health and safety standards in food manufacturing businesses across the country from January 2018[3]. The inspections are focused on two of the main causes of ill-health in the sector: • occupational asthma from exposure to flour dust in bakeries, cake and biscuit manufacturers and grain mills and • musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) – predominantly lower back pain and upper limb disorders from manual handling activities and repetitive tasks across the sector. The inspections follow the release of HSE's Manufacturing sector plan, which prioritises the reduction of cases of occupational lung disease and MSDs. Exposure to flour dust is the UK's second most commonly cited cause of occupational asthma. MSDs are the most common type of work-related illness in food manufacturing with handling injuries accounting for around 20% of reported employee injuries. HSE insists that such ill-health can be prevented when organisations have proper risk control systems in place. The inspections will ensure measures are being taken by those responsible to protect workers against health risks and HSE states that it will not hesitate to use enforcement to bring about improvements. It is also calling on those working in the industry to refresh their knowledge of its advice and guidance, available on its website. A new Campden BRI consultation has identified the challenges to be tackled by the food industry using science and technology[10]. The consultation involved over 600 face-to-face contributions covering the entire food supply chain and including a survey of Campden BRI's 2,400 members in 75 countries. Some of the new challenges identified during the consultation were: • Sustaining product quality in the face of rising costs of operations and materials • Soil health – stronger recognition of soil as a resource and methods for its protection • Human microbiota – understanding and harnessing the role of gut microbes in diet-related health conditions • Anti-microbial resistance – addressing its significance for the food and drink sector • Cyber-security – managing the benefits and risks of the ‘connected world’ (e.g. Internet of Things, ’Big Data’ and AI [artificial intelligence]) Some of the needs raised are more long standing but continue to feature in the consultation. These include assuring product safety, encouraging consumer wellbeing through healthy diets, protecting consumers from food fraud, tackling industry's skills shortage and encouraging sustainable practices and reduced use of resources. 1 in 400 Number of disposable coffee cups recycled each year 5.5 bn Number of plastic bottles annually consigned to landfill The UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee has issued two new reports on plastic recycling in the UK addressing plastic bottles and disposable coffee cups lined with plastic. The first report, published in December 2017[4], reveals that in the last 15 years, consumption of bottled water in the UK has doubled such that water bottles now make up around half of all plastic bottles. We use 13 billion plastic bottles every year and only 7.5 billion are recycled. The remaining 5.5 billion are landfilled, littered or incinerated. Plastic bottles make up a third of all plastic pollution in the sea. In the recent BBC Blue Planet II documentary[5], David Attenborough highlighted the dangers for marine animals created by plastics in the oceans and the potential risk of plastic uptake to the whole food chain. The Environmental Audit Committee has recommended that the Government introduces a Deposit Return Scheme, providing an economic incentive for consumers to recycle plastic bottles. Deposit return schemes operate in several European countries, as well as parts of Australia and the US. The Committee heard evidence that a deposit return scheme could help remove 700,000 plastic bottles from being littered each day. Several major retailers including Tesco, Iceland and the Co-op have recently announced their backing for such a scheme[6]. The monies raised from the proposed scheme could be reinvested in plastic reprocessing facilities in the UK. The UK currently exports 280,000-320,000 tonnes of mixed plastic to China each year. Given the recent Chinese ban on mixed plastic waste from the UK, this investment is urgent to avoid a huge increase in landfill. Plastic bottle manufacturers continue to use mixed polymer plastics, such as sleeve wrappings and coloured plastics, which contaminate the recycling stream and reduce the value of the recycled material. The Committee also recommends that the Government should introduce a mandated minimum use of 50% recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) in new plastic bottles by 2023 at the latest. Government should act to reduce the number and type of plastics in use in the UK to incentivise production and use of packaging that can be easily recycled within the UK's current recycling infrastructure. It is proposed that the actions identified could cut usage of plastic water bottles by 65%. The second report, published in January 2018[7], recommends that the Government sets a target that all single use coffee cups should be recycled by 2023. If this target is not achieved, the Government should ban disposable coffee cups. Disposable coffee cups are made from paper and lined with plastic to make them waterproof. This plastic lining cannot be removed by most recycling facilities. 2.5 billion coffee cups are used and thrown away each year in the UK, but less than 1 in 400 – just 0.25% – are recycled. The Prime Minister has launched a 25-year environment strategy, which includes a pledge to eliminate all ‘avoidable’ plastic waste, such as coffee cups and drinks bottles[8]. She has promised to extend the successful 5p levy on plastic bags to smaller shops and seek evidence on a possible charge on single-use plastic containers, such as takeaway boxes. Other initiatives include a plan to urge supermarkets to introduce aisles without any plastic packaging, where all food is sold loose, along with new research funding for ‘plastics innovation’ and aid to help developing nations deal with their plastic waste. Iceland has become the first major retailer to commit to eliminating plastic packaging for all its own brand products within five years to help end the ‘scourge’ of plastic pollution[9]. It plans to replace plastic with other packaging materials, including paper and pulp trays and paper bags, which would be recyclable through domestic waste collections or in-store recycling facilities. Iceland has already removed plastic disposable straws from its own label range and is introducing new food ranges in early 2018, which will use paper-based rather than plastic food trays. ■ Public Health England (PHE) has launched the first Change4Life campaign to promote healthier snacks for children[11]. The new campaign encourages parents to look for ‘100 calorie snacks, two a day max’ to help them purchase healthier snacks for their children. Half of children's sugar intake, currently around seven sugar cubes a day, comes from unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks, leading to obesity and dental decay. On average, children are consuming at least three unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks a day, with around a third consuming four or more. The overall result is that children consume three times more sugar than is recommended. Some supermarkets are supporting the campaign. Tesco will help parents – instore and online – choose affordable, healthier snacks that are 100 calories or less. Coop will also provide tasty and healthy snacking products, making it easier for customers to make healthier choices. PHE's improved Change4Life ‘Food Scanner’ app also shows parents how many calories, sugar, salt and saturated fat is in their food to help make healthier choices easier. Parents can also get money-off vouchers from Change4Life to help them try healthier snack options, including malt loaf, lower-sugar fromage frais, and drinks with no added sugar. Many of the unhealthy snacks children consume regularly are high in sugar and also typically high in calories, for example: • an ice-cream contains around 175 calories • a pack of crisps contains around 190 calories • a chocolate bar contains around 200 calories • a pastry contains around 270 calories The ‘100 calorie snacks, two a day max’ tip applies to all snacks apart from fruit and vegetables, as children should also be encouraged to eat a variety of these to achieve their 5 A Day. With a third of children leaving primary school overweight or obese, tackling obesity requires wider action in addition to individual efforts from parents. PHE is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the products children consume most by 2020, with work to reduce calories due to start in 2018. ■ The NHS is taking action to remove sugary drinks from its canteens, shops and vending machines during 2018[12]. Although almost two thirds of NHS trusts are now signed up to a voluntary scheme to reduce sales of sugary drinks to 10% or less of sold beverages, 91 NHS Trusts are yet to join the voluntary scheme. Hospitals and suppliers have been warned that if they do not take action to reduce sales of sugary drinks by the end of March 2018, a ban will be introduced instead. Some NHS Trusts have gone further and have introduced their own bans on sugary drinks. As well as hospitals, 14 national suppliers have signed up to the voluntary scheme including WH Smith, Marks & Spencer, Greggs and the Royal Voluntary Service. ■ DIARY 20-23 March 2018 ANUGA FOOD TECH Venue Cologne, Germany Web anugafoodtec.com 16-18 April 2018 FOOD & DRINK EXPO Venue NEC, Birmingham Web foodanddrinkexpo.co.uk 19 April 2018 IFST Spring Conference 2018 (SC18) ‘Managing Food Risk: Future Tools and Technologies’ Venue University of Birmingham, UK Web ifst.org/events/SC18 14-16 May 2018 2nd EuroSciCon Conference on Food Technology Venue Rome, Italy Web http://food-technology.euroscicon.com/ 11-12 June 2018 World Food Science and Technology Congress Venue Athens, Greece Web https://foodsciencecongress.conferenceseries.com/ 28-29 June 2018 ICFSN 2018: 20th International Conference on Food Science and Nutrition Venue London, UK Web waset.org/conference/2018/06/london/ICFSN 15-18 July 2018 IFT 18: A Matter of Science + Food Venue Chicago, Illinois Web iftevent.org/ 23-25 August 2018 2nd International Conference and Expo on Food Science Venue Las Vegas, USA Web cenetrionline.org/conference/international-conference-and-expo-on-food-science","['editorial', 'news']"

Nursing leadership from the inside out,2025,"FigureThe purpose of this article is to share the codesign processes, content elements, and participant outcomes of a leadership development workshop that was tailored to fit five different healthcare organizations and systems. A Culture of Inquiry Framework informed the work by emphasizing psychological safety, building connections, and using a design thinking process in the context of improving care and enhancing work environments, particularly for nurse leaders. Values derived from the Culture of Inquiry Framework, which guided not only the content that was included but also the delivery methods employed, include practice-based inquiry and innovation that are designed close to the work of leaders, by and for leaders, and with honest appraisal of the clinical realities.1,2 Aspects of this leadership development program that differentiate it from many of the others available are that the program is delivered within the organization and that the CNO and executive teams tailor the program elements, which were the most impactful elements influenced by the Culture of Inquiry Framework. BACKGROUND Sustaining, expanding, and deepening the leadership skills of nurse leaders continues to be a challenge that has captured the attention of national nursing organizations.3,4 Experienced leaders are exiting the nursing workforce at an unprecedented rate, and newer leaders are stepping in with less time in clinical practice. All leaders face an increasingly complex healthcare landscape. According to the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) Longitudinal Nursing Leadership Insight Study, 12% of nurse managers reported an intent to leave their position in the next 6 months, and 23% reported that they might consider leaving. Reasons listed included the negative impact of work on their health and well-being, pursuing a promotion or new opportunities, and conflicts with other leaders or colleagues.5 The challenges of the workplace include faster turnover among newer nurses, fierce wage competition, technologic innovations, artificial intelligence, incivility in the workplace, and remnants of the global pandemic such as staffing challenges and lack of organizational trust. The data on nurse well-being have rightly come into a new focus, with an emphasis on integrating individual, team, and organizational approaches to attract, nurture, and retain leaders.6-10 Having a solid succession plan through effective nurse leadership development is also critical.11 The authors contend that such programs include well-being content and strategies. It's becoming clear that, although evidence-based resources to address individual and team well-being continue to become available at a hopeful pace, a one-size-fits-all approach isn't helpful or meaningful in fast-paced and unique clinical settings and cultures. Therefore, the method of codesigning a leadership workshop was used to address the unique needs of several pilot organizations, focusing on adapting the content and delivery with active and ongoing input from the CNOs and executive teams involved. Creating a safe learning environment (psychological safety); cultivating relationships between individuals, teams, and organizations (building connections); and using human-centered design (design thinking) provided a framework for advancing the work.1,2 WORKSHOP CREATION AND ITERATION A collaborative response to the nurse leader challenges mentioned above was cocreated and iterated with the purpose of addressing the challenge of providing information, support, and recognition for emerging and existing leaders. A nurse scholar, with ongoing feedback from CNOs and their leadership team members, designed an adaptable leadership workshop aimed specifically on programing for nurses. This emphasis on nursing is notable because nurses have a low utilization rate for employee-assistance program services despite concerning data regarding anxiety, depression, and burnout in nurses, as well as a higher rate of suicide among nurses compared with the public.12,13 Davidson and colleagues have done decades of research on this topic and widely support workplace wellness as one means to address the crisis in this group of caregivers that clearly warrants focused attention.14 ""Nursing Leadership from the Inside Out"" is an evidence-based, nurse-led workshop delivered within the cultural context of the organization, rooted in positive psychology, and designed to cultivate both individual and team well-being. The program was delivered to a pilot group of hospitals and healthcare organizations. The content focused on both the team and individual level, meant to provide experiential learning within a team context. The facilitators refreshed the workshop delivery method to fit each organization, which resulted in refined learning objectives, active learning experiences, and content modules. Specific questions on the evaluation form matched the learning objectives for each workshop. In advance of delivering the workshop, the design team met two to four times with each CNO to ascertain relevance to the organization and vet any emerging situations that might require attention in the workshop (such as workplace disruptions, leadership transitions, victories, or challenges). Communication with the design team and the CNO played an important role throughout and after workshop implementation to ensure relevancy, consistency with the mission/vision, and any desired follow-up. Evaluation of the workshops was deemed exempt from the corresponding author's institutional review board. NURSE LEADER PERSPECTIVES Each nurse executive had a slightly different reason for offering the workshop in their setting, as described here: Nurse executive 1. The CNE of a suburban teaching hospital was concerned about the increasing stress on the nurse manager while ""rebuilding"" their nursing teams as they emerged from the pandemic. Supporting the nurse leaders' well-being was critical to this effort as there was much focus on direct care nurse well-being but not on nurse leader well-being. ""The sessions provided an opportunity to increase nurse leader bonding through the cohort sessions and decreased the social isolation experienced by many as they felt 'the weight of the world' on their individual shoulders,"" said the CNE. ""Our managers have varying levels of experience, and this cohort format allowed everyone to learn from and support each other."" Nurse executive 2. The CNO of a large, urban academic medical center was concerned about the leader well-being and trauma-informed competency at both the manager and director levels. ""The opportunity for involvement in the design of content and logistics of the program was helpful in terms of tailoring an approach to both the individual and team leadership needs in the context of extreme fatigue,"" the CNO stated. ""It was apparent that a program on deep breathing, chair yoga, and meditation were not what was needed, and not enough to fully support healing and growth."" She anticipated the team approach fostered peer relationships and support, and the strategies were going to be immediately applicable. Nurse executive 3. ""In the aftermath of the pandemic, nursing leadership development has become even more critical as healthcare systems grapple with the emotional and spiritual trauma experienced by both patients and frontline healthcare workers. As the Chief Nursing Officer in an acute care hospital, I recognized that providing resources for nursing leadership development in a group setting would offer a unique opportunity to address the nuanced challenges they were experiencing,"" this nurse executive explained. ""The opportunity to foster a supportive environment where nurse leaders come together to share experiences, process emotions, and strategize effective approaches to healing and rebuilding seemed paramount to providing them with the tools they needed to further develop."" WORKSHOP FORMAT Depending on input from the CNO and executive team, the workshop was piloted in various forms, including online in three 2-hour sessions, online in three 45-minute ""lunch and learn"" segments, and in-person in one 7-hour retreat. The nurse scholar who codeveloped the content also facilitated each of the iterations above and participated in ongoing design, implementation, and evaluation discussions with the design team. At the conclusion of each session, a short evaluation survey was provided for participants in the form of a QR code and in a follow-up email. Evaluation surveys were used to provide feedback to the CNO and executive team and to the design team to guide changes in content and delivery formats to best meet participants' needs. Elements of the workshop Beyond the codesign process, one of the most critical workshop elements was to create and maintain a psychologically safe space so that participants were supported in pausing their work responsibilities while taking needed time to self-reflect and learn with their colleagues. Some of the important components in establishing such a workshop environment included: An introduction from the CNO clarifying the purpose and encouraging participation. The opening welcome to the sessions also included a request that participants refrain from cell phone use as much as possible to enable them to focus on the experience of learning together, and an assurance that the facilitator and design team had worked closely with the CNO and executive team in advance of the workshop to plan highly relevant content. A description of the alignment of personal, professional, unit, and organizational desired impacts. This portion of the session focused on individual-, team-, organization-, and system-level interventions, recognizing that higher-level efforts are required for systems change to occur. A reminder to remain open and nonjudgmental with participants. The facilitator stated and reinforced that alternative opinions, ideas, experiences, and perspectives were welcome and that diverse thought was seen as a strength. Introductions of the participants. Every workshop, regardless of virtual or in-person format, included ample time for each participant (15 to 40 people) to introduce themselves by name and the unit where they worked, their role (if they wished), and something they hoped to gain from the workshop. This time proved to be beneficial because, even in organizations with long-standing teams, there were often a few newer leaders who didn't know their colleagues. Community agreements and ground rules that included reminders about confidentiality, trust, willingness to engage with the content and experiences to the participant's comfort level, and supportive listening practices when participants shared perspectives. A brief centering practice upon arrival to bring the mind, body, and being into alignment with the present moment. Participation in this centering practice was voluntary. Learning priorities The workshop's learning priorities included: Emphasize the importance of strong leadership. Explore readiness to lead and sustain change. Appreciate the importance of leading the well-being of one's team. Engage skills of mindful leadership. Discuss the definition, meaning, and how to practice trauma-informed leadership. Review strategies for leading a fatigued workforce and identification of burnout among team members. Describe elements of psychological safety and a healthy practice environment. Emphasize the value of reinvigorating joy into one's work life. Key topics: Content outline Leadership. Most organizations employed a range of novice to more experienced leaders, so providing content and learning experiences that were relevant across the spectrum was important. The leadership content was framed by highlighting the rare but important opportunity to take the time to pause and examine accomplishments, areas for growth, and unresolved challenges prior to moving ahead. Specific examples encompassed: Remembering each person has a unique perspective and can tap into their authentic experience. Acknowledging that self-reflection as a leader provides the opportunity to align future steps with whole person well-being. Appreciating that one's unique leadership experience can enhance self-respect and dignity and provide a way of intentional caring for self and others. Discussing and applying concepts of self-stewardship, self-compassion, and self-regulation within the context of a leadership role. Readiness to lead and sustain change. Organizations have experienced a rapid succession of practice change projects and mandates, particularly since the global pandemic. Although leaders must implement change processes, the fatigue from multiple, often simultaneous, change initiatives can result in perceived resistance, reduced productivity, and difficulty prioritizing among leaders and those they lead. Of equal importance is sustaining change once the initial enthusiasm and motivation for change dissipate. We covered these topics by integrating change models with experiential learning and small-group dialogue followed by debriefing discussions. A helpful question we used for self-reflection and discussion was: ""Consider your personal readiness to change. How ready are you to make significant changes in your life? This could be personal or professional changes, or a little of each."" Answer choices included: 1 = not at all ready, 2 = a little ready, 3 = somewhat ready, 4 = ready, and 5 = already practicing. During debriefing, questions posed were: ""What factors went into your response? What dimensions of your life are you most ready to change? When you are asking staff to change practice behaviors, how do you balance empathy and accountability?"" Leading the well-being of teams. Individual- and team-level well-being and resilience approaches were discussed, within the context of acknowledging the diversity of responses, backgrounds, and cultures. The discussion addressed the current state of the workforce and offered selected evidence-based strategies from the literature to navigate the complexity and demand.15 Mindful leadership. The concept and practice of mindfulness was introduced as an evidence-based strategy for burnout prevention, a skill for individual/team and organization well-being, and a leadership development tool. Mindfulness-based approaches were described and experienced, including micropractices, self-awareness, stewarding energy and effort, values clarification, and authentic yet appropriate communication.16-19 Trauma-informed leadership. The distinction and meaning of ""Big T trauma and little t trauma"" and relevance to nursing were discussed. The exploration included the impact not only on patient care but also on leading a workforce that has experienced various types of personal, professional, societal, inherited, and intersectional trauma. Trauma is personal, unique, and dynamic, and leaders can learn language, behavior, and approaches to acknowledge trauma effectively.20,21 Leading exhausted/burned-out workforce. Participants learned strategies for identifying energy leaks and depletions in themselves and others, as well as assessing sources of energy and vitality. The workshop focused on building sustainable practices and leading by example by prioritizing personal wellness (being a ""real model"" not a ""role model,"" which often implies perfectionistic attitudes). Examples of strategies included: Begin each huddle with a 2-minute mindfulness, gratitude, or grounding exercise. Start one's day by listening to a short meditation, self-compassion exercise, peaceful music, or a square breathing exercise during the daily commute. Encourage frequent breaks that incorporate a mindfulness exercise or getting outside of the work environment. End the workday with positive reflection, even if mired in a conflict or challenge. Promote and normalize available internal mental health and wellness resources. Psychological safety and healthy practice environment. Psychological safety has been recognized as critically important for a positive healthcare work environment. It's described as ""a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.""22 Leadership skills include establishing an open and respectful communication culture, being as transparent as appropriate to build trust, setting clear expectations, reframing failure and mistakes as opportunities for learning and growth, and taking a supportive and consultative approach to leadership. Reinvigorating joy. Making joy in one's personal and professional life a priority is a strongly supported lifestyle behavior.23-25 People intrinsically seek joy. Joy connects people more powerfully than almost any other human experience. Research in other sectors, including business and sports, indicates that joy arises from a combination of harmony, impact, and acknowledgment. In healthcare, similar strategies can be employed as those used with sports teams, including: Harmony: Every player has a distinct role in achieving the goal. Impact: Team harmony leads to impact, which further fuels joy. Acknowledgment: Great coaches instruct their players to immediately point to the teammates who created the scoring opportunity. Workshop culmination. Joy was intentionally discussed at the end of the workshop for several reasons. The participants' comfort level typically deepened individually and as a group over the shared experience and discussion; thus, they were ready to discuss the rare (in healthcare) topic of joy as it pertains to them and their teams. The facilitator also presented the opportunity for participants to craft a personal/professional action plan that puts into place one or more of the topics covered in the workshop. Time was provided for participants to create accountability and support plans with colleagues. Finally, time was provided for participants to complete the evaluation, focusing on the key learning priorities. OUTCOMES Results of the evaluation surveys were shared in aggregated form with the CNO individually at the conclusion of the workshop(s). Likewise, evaluations were shared with the content codesigners to inform and guide future workshops. Results of the workshop evaluation surveys are presented here. Each workshop was guided by slightly different learning objectives and points of priority, so the evaluation surveys also varied slightly to reflect the specific objectives. In addition to the graphs for the quantitative questions, selected quotes from the open-ended questions are included. Average outcomes data for both virtual and in-person modalities 99% of participants believe the program met the learning objectives. 97.19% of participants believe that participating in this program positively impacted their personal well-being. 94.46% of participants believe that participating in this program made them feel valued by their employer. 90.2% of participants believe that this program would have a meaningful impact on their leadership practice. 96.38% of participants believe that this program has cultivated a sense of community and belonging. 91.7% of participants believe that this program has positively impacted their engagement, joy in practice, and intent to stay with employer. 92.5% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend this program to another nurse colleague. Tables 1-3 represent the percentage of participants that agreed or strongly agreed with the corresponding statement pertaining to satisfaction with program components.TABLE 1:: Average scores of in-person and virtual modalitiesTABLE 2:: In-person single-day workshopTABLE 3:: Virtual delivery modelSelected open-ended responses from all workshop evaluations ""This program allowed me to take time to care for myself and deepen relationships with my colleagues. This was a much-needed reset."" ""This was a great project but should go to in person if possible."" ""Great to meet other leaders and work on this together."" ""Best experience ever. I loved it!"" ""Excellent program and I feel very grateful to have participated."" ""Our jobs are difficult. This was just what I needed to feel reinvigorated."" ""Great program. Would love to do it more often."" ""I loved the mindfulness activities that were included. Long-term check-ins would be appreciated as well."" ""This was a good program to learn strategies to help improve my well-being so I can be a better leader."" ""Wonderful program and facilitator! So important for nurse leaders to understand this content and apply to leadership practice."" ""Follow-up from our leaders on how to support these practices would be great. Practice what we have learned."" Overall, most of the responses were positive. In addition to responses included here, participant comments demonstrated that conducting the workshop in person is ideal for community building and strong impact, providing follow-up support and reinforcements are important for sustainability, and ensuring organizational support for leader well-being is crucial. Nurse executives and their teams also provided input on noteworthy outcomes and sustainability efforts. One of the organizations reported that year-to-date turnover for the roles of those who attended went from 30.7% to 11%. Another organization reported that this program was part of the nursing leadership support efforts that resulted in a 40-point increase in ""likelihood to recommend my department for work"" during the 2 years postimplementation, which was based on responses from managers who participated. Sustainability efforts included providing a ""round 2/refresh"" for managers who went through the program initially, as well as offering the program to a new cohort of newer managers/leaders who were not in place at the time of initial program launch. Additionally, nurse executives reported doing group check-ins to emphasize key points. DISCUSSION The evaluation surveys indicated a high level of agreement that the learning priorities were met and that the facilitator was effective and had pertinent expertise. Likewise, the results show a positive impact on personal well-being, feeling valued by the employer, increased leadership skills, sense of community and belonging with other leaders within the organization, and intent to stay with the current employer. Most respondents were highly likely to recommend the workshop to colleagues. The open-ended comments also reflect a strong degree of satisfaction, learning, and enthusiasm for the program. Some participants expressed a preference for in-person experiences rather than virtual. Using a collaborative, iterative, leader-informed design based on the Culture of Inquiry Framework, ""Leadership from the Inside Out,"" is research-based, yet dynamic and adaptable for a variety of learner groups. Lessons learned include the importance of close communication with the design team, CNO and executive team throughout the planning and implementation, as well as after the workshop for evaluation purposes. In-person workshops were very well received, and participants were better able to be fully present with each other and the learning environment. The results indicate slightly higher participant satisfaction ratings with in-person compared with virtual on most evaluation survey questions. On the other hand, the virtual workshops were less costly and allowed participants to join from remote locations. The topics and active learning experiences included in the workshop were rated as highly relevant and practical for leaders from a diversity of positions, length of time in role, and clinical background. Intentional engagement strategies used for the virtual workshops included frequent breakout sessions with two to three individuals per room, having a cofacilitator monitor the chat function to amplify any comments or questions, and ample time for questions and answers throughout the sessions. Additionally, individual action plans, journaling responses, and summation at the end of each session provided individuals with the opportunity to reflect and personalize the content. Having the CNO participate in all, or part of, the workshop increased buy-in and clarified alignment with nursing organizational goals; however, CNO presence may have provided a potential barrier for some participants to express concerns or criticisms during the workshop. It became clear how critically important it was to codesign the workshop to fit the priorities, culture, and specific challenges of each organization in real time. Although the topic areas didn't vary dramatically, some areas were emphasized, reduced, or left out, depending on guidance from the CNO and executive team. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK There are many opportunities to expand this work. Based on program evaluation data and national workforce trends, future directions may include an expanded emphasis on the link between leadership and well-being at all levels (individual, team, organization, and systems). An important cohort to target is new graduate nurses or those 1 to 2 years out of school who are at an elevated risk of leaving their positions or the profession altogether. Another opportunity is to codesign and deliver programs and workshops with interprofessional teams, with a dedication to diversity, equity, belonging, and inclusion. INVESTING IN LEADERS As nurse leaders navigate an era of universal challenges in maintaining a healthy nursing workforce, marked by decreased tenure and heightened complexity of patient needs, it's imperative to include innovative approaches to enhance nursing leadership skills and foster well-being. This article describes a customizable, nurse-led, evidence-based program that can be further tailored to meet the needs of other organizations. Key learning priorities, facilitation approaches, and program evaluation data were included. Participants were enthusiastic about the content and delivery methods, as evidenced in the program evaluation results. One of the key differentiators of this program is that it's tailored to the specific organization and delivered in a way that is specifically guided by the CNO and nurse leadership team, making important inroads into the unique culture of the organization. A powerful framework to guide leadership development is the Culture of Inquiry.2 Organizations should strongly consider integrating the Culture of Inquiry Framework into the implementation of programs aimed at improving nursing leadership and well-being. By fostering a culture that values curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning, the Culture of Inquiry Framework empowers nursing leaders to adapt to evolving challenges, drive positive change, and promote resilience within their teams. Through embracing this framework, leaders can create environments in which nurses feel supported, engaged, and equipped to deliver high-quality care amid the complexities of modern healthcare. Committing to a Culture of Inquiry in the nursing workplace is a powerful step in ensuring that every nurse can thrive and make a meaningful impact on patient outcomes. There's also a need for successful and innovative programs like the one discussed for the leader workforce that, in general, is less tenured relative to the past decade. Investing in solid leadership development across the career span translates into positive patient, staff, and organizational outcomes. Exciting opportunities exist for tailoring, implementing, and evaluating experiential programming to positively impact leadership development from novice to expert clinical leaders.","['nursing', 'leadership', 'inside']"
Artificial Intelligence and Employee Well-Being,2024,"AI for employee well-being with AI disrupting psychological and physical healthcare within organizations, the area of employee wellness is no different. Using AI tools, organizations can build healthier workspaces to increase productivity and improve the satisfaction of employees.

Perceived Air Quality and Productivity in the Office Building,2020,"Abstract Problems of perceived quality of the environment find its reason especially when monitoring performance and productivity of work. Thus, verification of the degree of environmental quality impact on employee performance comes into consideration. The results of two independent studies involving 50 subjects, and using similar procedures and blind exposures have shown that increasing the air quality (by decreasing the pollution load or by increasing the ventilation rate, with otherwise constant indoor climate conditions) can improve the performance of simulated office work (text typing, addition and proof-reading). Performance testing was performed in the open space office of an office building at three air exchange intensities: n 1 = 0.5 h −1 , n 2 = 1.5 h −1 and n 3 = 2.5 h −1 . Other physical environmental parameters that could have affected the assessors’ performance were maintained in the range: indoor air temperature θ ai = 22 - 24 °C, relative air humidity φ ai = 40 - 60%, air velocity v ai ≤ 0.25 m.s −1 , noise level load L = 40 - 50 dB (A), daylight - diffuse radiation component. The present results document the productivity benefits of providing good indoor air quality and indicate that providing indoor air of a higher ventilation level will increase productivity.","['perceived', 'quality', 'productivity', 'office', 'building']"

Personal Protective Equipment Detection Using Computer Vision Techniques,2023,"Abstract The intensive use of chemicals, machines and electrical assets introduced unsafe conditions to the workplace. An unsafe condition is a physical condition that can cause an incident, such as operating without training, defective supplies and poor housekeeping. Such conditions might cause serious injury or even death. As well as the human impact, unsafe conditions have a significant impact on operational excellence and the financial state of a company. Companies are committed to ensure a safe environment by setting safety polices, conducting safety training, fire prevention systems, safety manuals and signboards and providing safety gears. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is safety equipment that can maintain the safety of employees in hazardous conditions, such as hot surfaces and toxic chemicals that can cause serious injuries and illness. PPE is sometimes referred to as the last line of defense. Some workers might not comply with safety policies or refuse to wear the PPE. To overcome the manual safety checks and compliance of employees, in this paper we propose an AI-powered computer vision automation solution leveraging the state of the object detection model. Computer vision is the field that mimics human vision to extract purposeful information from videos and images. Computer vision brings about various functionalities to perform tasks such as object detection, object classification, object identification and object verification. The proposed solution is developed by using a computer vision technique that detects various types of PPEs in real time. The main purpose of this project is to detect a presence of eight classes (person, helmet color: Red, Yellow, Blue and White, head, vest, glasses). The best results were achieved by applying the tunned YOLOv5 on a set of construction site images with corresponding annotations in YOLO format. The proposed solution automates the process of detection and monitoring PPE and employee behavior in operation fields in real-time. Automating the detection can reflect the business value by reducing the timeframe for tracking, creating a safe environment that in turn can increase the productivity and safety of the workers and reduce the costs of operations. The proposed solution includes all the components of data ingestion, data processing, object detection model and deployment on the edge device or server to improve safety.","['personal', 'protective', 'equipment', 'detection', 'computer', 'vision', 'techniques']"
Causes of Cardiovascular Hospitalization and Death in Patients With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy (from the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial [ATTR-ACT]),2021,"In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), tafamidis significantly reduced mortality and cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations compared with placebo in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). This analysis aimed to assess the causes of CV-related death and hospitalization in ATTR-ACT to provide further insight into the progression of ATTR-CM and efficacy of tafamidis. ATTR-ACT was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized study. Patients with hereditary or wild-type ATTR-CM were randomized to tafamidis (n = 264) or placebo (n = 177) for 30 months. The independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee determined whether certain investigator-reported events met the definition of disease-related efficacy endpoints using predefined criteria. Cause-specific reasons for CV-related deaths (heart failure [HF], arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, sudden death, stroke, and other CV causes) and hospitalizations (HF, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and other CV causes) were assessed. Total CV-related deaths was 53 (20.1%) with tafamidis and 50 (28.2%) with placebo, with HF (15.5% tafamidis, 22.6% placebo), followed by sudden death (2.7% tafamidis, 5.1% placebo), the most common causes. The number of patients with a CV-related hospitalization was 138 (52.3%) with tafamidis and 107 (60.5%) with placebo; with HF the most common cause (43.2% tafamidis, 50.3% placebo). All predefined causes of CV-related death or hospitalization were less frequent with tafamidis than placebo.

All patients provided written informed consent. The independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee conducted a blinded review of all potential study endpoints to determine whether investigator-reported events met the definition of disease-related efficacy endpoints using predefined criteria. All cases of death during the study were reported to the Endpoint Adjudication Committee, which reviewed the case to determine the cause of death. Death due to any cause was included in the primary efficacy evaluation (together with a heart transplant and implantation of a durable CMAD, which were counted as death for the efficacy analyses). All deaths were reviewed to determine if they were CV-related or not, with CV-related causes recorded as HF, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, stroke, and other CV causes (see Supplementary Table 1). At each visit, it was reported by the investigator if the patient had been hospitalized (including the reason for hospitalization), with all hospitalizations reported to the Endpoint Adjudication Committee. Hospitalization for endpoint adjudication was defined as a nonelective admission to an acute care setting for medical therapy that resulted in at least a 24-hour stay (or a date change if the time of admission/discharge was not available). Hospitalization reports were also reviewed by the Endpoint Adjudication Committee to determine if they were CV-related or not, with CV-related causes recorded as HF, arrhythmia, MI, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and other CV causes (see Supplementary Table 2). The hazard ratio for time to mortality was derived from a Cox proportional hazards model with genotype (ATTRv and ATTRwt) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) baseline classification (NYHA classes I and II combined, and NYHA class III) in the model. Frequency of all-cause hospitalization was compared using a Poisson regression model with treatment, genotype (ATTRv and ATTRwt), NYHA baseline classification (NYHA classes I and II combined, and NYHA class III), treatment-by-genotype interaction, and treatment-by-NYHA baseline classification interaction terms as factors adjusted for treatment duration.7Maurer MS Schwartz JH Gundapaneni B Elliott PM Merlini G Waddington-Cruz M Kristen AV Grogan M Witteles R Damy T Drachman BM Shah SJ Hanna M Judge DP Barsdorf AI Huber P Patterson TA Riley S Schumacher J Stewart M Sultan MB Rapezzi C Tafamidis treatment for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.N Engl J Med. 2018; 379: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar Comorbidities, numbers of deaths, and hospitalizations are shown using descriptive statistics.

In TOPCAT, there were 526 total deaths, 111 adjudicated as sudden death (21.1%), and 67 adjudicated as HF (12.7%). Based on this comparison, it appears that in patients with ATTR-CM, in contrast to other patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, the predominant cause of death is HF. The frequency of CV-related hospitalizations per year (per patient) with tafamidis (0.48) compared with placebo (0.70), with the relative risk ratio for the treatment difference, were previously reported as part of the predefined secondary outcomes from ATTR-ACT.7Maurer MS Schwartz JH Gundapaneni B Elliott PM Merlini G Waddington-Cruz M Kristen AV Grogan M Witteles R Damy T Drachman BM Shah SJ Hanna M Judge DP Barsdorf AI Huber P Patterson TA Riley S Schumacher J Stewart M Sultan MB Rapezzi C Tafamidis treatment for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.N Engl J Med. 2018; 379: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar The high number of CV-related hospitalizations per patient reflects the extraordinary impact of amyloidosis in the evolution of the disease.

The majority of CV hospitalizations in both groups were due to HF, followed by arrhythmias, with a higher prevalence in the placebo groups; this was similar to other contemporary HF clinical trials. ATTR-CM is a systemic disease and is associated with a large and complex number of comorbidities in this elderly population. Consequently, adjudication of events, in particular the main reason for hospitalization, is always challenging. However, all events were adjudicated blindly by an experienced endpoint adjudication committee with predefined criteria to classify CV causes. Counting the number of repeated hospitalizations during follow-up may be misleading if, as was the case, mortality is high. Nevertheless, higher mortality imposes a bias on the total number of hospitalizations, which may be artificially more frequent in the group with a lower death rate. In spite of this possible bias, total and CV-related hospitalizations were less frequent with tafamidis compared with placebo. In conclusion, among patients randomized in ATTR-ACT, all adjudicated causes of CV-related death and hospitalization were less common with tafamidis than with placebo, with most deaths CV-related. HF was the most common cause of CV-related death and hospitalization. Upon request, and subject to review, Pfizer will provide the data that support the findings of this study.

An ethical imperative: Safety and specialization as nursing priorities of WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer,2019,"Cancer is a leading cause of global childhood mortality from noncommunicable diseases, affecting approximately 300 000 children/adolescents (0-19 years old) annually.1 Of these children/adolescents, approximately 89% live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with an average 30% estimated survival rate, less than half the rate in high-income countries (HIC).2 This inequality galvanized the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer in September 2018 to improve survival rates to 60% by 2030.3 WHO has designated 2020 as the Year of the Nurse and Midwife and highlights that nurses, together with midwives, constitute the largest group of health workers4; therefore, strengthening nursing is critical to meeting this target. Although WHO initiatives for nursing have generally prioritized primary care,5 the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer is aiming for highly specialized care in LMIC. To achieve the 2030 target, implementation and scale-up require recognizing the needs and capacities of health professionals, including nurses. Nurses in LMIC are frequently exposed to occupational hazards due to work environments that lack the required resources for safe care, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) for handling chemotherapy.6, 7 The absence of specialized education, coupled with frequent rotation of trained staff, leaves nurses ill-equipped to safely deliver care for children/adolescents with cancer.8 The Nurse Specialists of the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer join public calls for all nurses (particularly those in resource-limited settings), to be provided with protection when managing hazardous drugs as well as oncology specialization training to ensure optimal nursing care.9-11 It is an ethical imperative that nurses are strengthened and equipped with knowledge and skills required to care for this vulnerable population and provided a safe environment for doing so. Baseline standards for the provision of safe and effective nursing care in LMIC have been published by the Paediatric Oncology Developing Countries (PODC) Nursing Working Group of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP).12 The standards provide a framework for promoting a positive practice environment for care delivery (Table 1) and have received widespread endorsement (https://siop-online.org/baseline-nursing-standards/). Nurse-to-patient ratios at different care levels: Intensive care unit: 1 nurse to ≤ 2 patients ≥ 2 weeks theory/clinical skills training Learning objectives Knowledge/skills validation ≥ 3 to 4 weeks clinical preceptorship Hand hygiene supplies Chemotherapy PPE Chemotherapy prepared by pharmacist Chemotherapy is a standard treatment required to cure most childhood cancers. Nurses, pharmacists, and physicians who prepare chemotherapy,13, 14 as well as hospital support personnel (e.g., cleaners and waste management staff) and families who are exposed to chemotherapy and hazardous waste, face immediate and long-term health risks, including cancer, miscarriages, and infertility.15, 16 Adverse effects from hazardous drug exposure are entirely preventable with proper use of PPE for chemotherapy administration and biosafety cabinets for preparation, especially in settings without closed system transfer devices for chemotherapy administration as mandated in many HIC.17, 18 Cost and supply chain challenges can be major barriers to reliable availability of essential devices and technology in LMIC.19 Nonetheless, the cost of securing PPE for safe handling of chemotherapy and hazardous drugs and materials is minimal in comparison with other costs of scaling up cancer treatment.20 It is not ethically defendable to invest in contemporary pediatric cancer treatment while failing to protect nurses and other health professionals from avoidable health risks in their work environments as recommended in numerous international guidelines.11, 18 Given that PPE has been secured for infectious disease management (e.g., Ebola21) and other public health threats,22, 23 obtaining these resources to deliver chemotherapy safely is surely achievable. There has been a persistent failure in LMIC to ensure access to PPE for safe preparation, administration, and disposal of chemotherapy for nurses,8 pharmacists, and physicians.24, 14 This includes chemotherapy-tested gloves, masks, protective eyewear and disposable impermeable gowns,11 and at minimum, a level 2B biosafety cabinet with appropriate ventilation.25 There is also a lack of appropriate training for health professionals in safe handling practices,26, 27 although there are increasing efforts to address this.28, 29 Investing in health workforce specialized education and training is supported by WHO Education Guidelines.30 Given the complexity of pediatric cancer diagnoses, treatment, and care, nurses require specialized education and clinical training to deliver safe, quality care and reduce risk for patient harm.31, 10 Specialized nursing education in all settings where children/adolescents with cancer are cared for, including operating rooms and intensive care units, improves quality and outcomes while strengthening broader health services.32 Many train-the-trainer programs in pediatric oncology nursing have been conducted since the 1990s. However, few of these programs have established sustained specialized nursing education in either an in-country school of nursing or a hospital clinical setting, although successful programs have been established in Pakistan, Egypt,10 Jordan,33 Lebanon,34 and Latin America.35 Ultimately, successful specialized nursing education programs (from diagnosis through survivorship or palliative care) are those with local ownership and integration in officially recognized nursing education systems. In too many countries, nurses are rotated between departments or for mandatory public health service,32, 36 hindering achievement of increasing competence and expertise.12 Pediatric oncology units require a dedicated nursing team with knowledge and experience in administering chemotherapy, monitoring side effects, managing oncology emergencies, and providing patient/family education. Developing this unique skill set is an inefficient investment unless arbitrary rotation of nurses is stopped, because knowledge and expertise is lost when nurses leave the unit. Nurse rotation also threatens retention and is a serious issue in LMIC37 where nursing shortages are acute,38, 39 specifically in pediatric oncology units. Historically, clinician exposure to health risks has been inherent to communicable disease treatment and guiding ethical principles have been articulated. Kass et al.40 write about key ethical concepts for Ebola that are relevant for cancer care (Table 2). Children/adolescents suffering from cancer in LMIC have the right to curative treatment. However, it would be ethically questionable to scale up diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer as part of the WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer in LMIC, if the ability of nurses and other health professionals to deliver such services safely is ignored. Access to PPE for safe handling of chemotherapy and the appropriate education and skills to deliver safe pediatric cancer care are sine qua non. WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer has a crucial role in improving global access to appropriate childhood cancer care; we argue it is an ethical imperative to ensure (a) adequate protective equipment for all those handling hazardous drugs and (b) that specialized pediatric oncology nursing education and nonrotation of nurses is officially recognized, prioritized, and locally integrated worldwide. There has been a strong focus on standards of accountability for health care in LMIC,9, 41 but historically, a lack of prioritization, or even neglect, of protective measures for nurses and others has been evident. We must promote standards, identify incentives, and provide a solid rationale to institutions and governments to prioritize access to PPE for all those handling hazardous drugs, and, in parallel, advance specialized nursing roles and education to develop proficiency in pediatric oncology nursing care and optimize patient outcomes.42 The Nurse Specialists of WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer urge WHO Member States and facilities delivering cancer treatment to prioritize safe nursing work environments and specialized education to improve overall population health. Health policy makers and hospital administrators can improve nurse recruitment and retention by creating a positive practice environment ensuring nurse occupational health and safety.43 Promoting such environments through safe chemotherapy handling, specialized education, and nonrotation of nurses in WHO Member States is essential to improve the safety and outcomes of children/adolescents with cancer globally.

The Impact of Information Technology On Data-Driven Decision Making In Human Resource Management,2024,"In the contemporary landscape of human resource management (HRM), the integration of information technology (IT) has revolutionized data-driven decision-making processes. This shift is characterized by the increased reliance on data analytics, cloud computing, and advanced software applications that enable HR professionals to harness vast amounts of data effectively. As organizations strive for agility and competitiveness, the role of IT in HRM has become pivotal, influencing various aspects such as recruitment, performance management, employee engagement, and talent development. The first major impact of IT on data-driven decision-making in HRM is the enhancement of recruitment processes. Traditional hiring methods often relied on subjective assessments and limited candidate data. However, IT solutions, such as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and AI-driven recruitment tools, have enabled HR managers to analyze candidates’ qualifications, experiences, and fit with organizational culture based on data-driven metrics. This not only improves the quality of hires but also reduces time-to-fill positions and enhances overall recruitment efficiency. Performance management has evolved significantly due to the integration of IT. Performance appraisal systems now utilize real-time data analytics to track employee performance against key performance indicators (KPIs). This allows HR managers to make informed decisions about promotions, training needs, and workforce planning. The implementation of continuous feedback mechanisms, facilitated by IT platforms, fosters a culture of transparency and engagement, enabling employees to take ownership of their development. IT has transformed employee engagement strategies through the use of data analytics. Organizations now leverage employee surveys and feedback tools that provide insights into employee satisfaction and engagement levels. By analyzing this data, HR professionals can identify trends, address concerns proactively, and implement targeted initiatives that enhance workplace culture and retention rates. Such data-driven approaches ensure that decisions are aligned with employee needs and organizational objectives. The role of IT in talent development cannot be overstated. Learning Management Systems (LMS) and data analytics tools provide HR managers with the capability to assess skill gaps and monitor training effectiveness. By analyzing learning outcomes and employee progress, organizations can tailor development programs that align with both individual career paths and organizational goals. This strategic alignment is crucial for fostering a skilled workforce capable of meeting future challenges. Despite these benefits, the reliance on IT in HRM also poses challenges, particularly regarding data privacy and security. As organizations collect and analyze large volumes of employee data, they must navigate complex regulations and ethical considerations to protect sensitive information. This underscores the need for robust data governance frameworks that ensure compliance while fostering a culture of trust within the organization. In conclusion, the impact of information technology on data-driven decision-making in human resource management is profound. By leveraging data analytics and advanced IT tools, organizations can enhance their recruitment processes, improve performance management, boost employee engagement, and foster talent development.It is essential for HR professionals to address the challenges of data privacy and security to maximize the benefits of IT in HRM. As technology continues to evolve, the synergy between IT and HRM will play a critical role in shaping the future of work.","['impact', 'information', 'technology', 'data-driven', 'decision', 'making', 'human', 'resource', 'management']"
Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) Response to Eculizumab Treatment in Patients from the Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Registry (P1-5.020),2023,"<h3>Objective:</h3> To quantify the proportion of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who responded to treatment with eculizumab, as assessed by the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale, and to investigate potential predictors of response in clinical practice. <h3>Background:</h3> Eculizumab is effective in improving functional ability and muscle strength in patients with gMG, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. To optimize treatment outcomes, it is important to understand the differences in characteristics between responders and non-responders. <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> Patients were enrolled in a gMG registry that collects clinical practice data on the effectiveness of eculizumab in patients with gMG in the USA. The analysis population included patients with MG-ADL total scores both prior to eculizumab initiation, and at or after enrollment in the registry. Response to eculizumab was defined as an improvement of ≥ 3 points in MG-ADL total score; non-response was an improvement of &lt; 3 points, no change or worsening in score. Predictors of response analyzed included patient demographics, disease characteristics and treatment duration. Analysis data cut-off was July 5, 2022. <h3>Results:</h3> In the analysis population (n = 80), 87.5% of patients were White, 58.8% were male and mean (standard deviation; SD) age at diagnosis was 54.7 (19.9) years. At the time of analysis, 65% of patients met the definition of response to eculizumab treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in demographics between responders and non-responders. Responders had a significantly higher MG-ADL total score before treatment compared with non-responders (mean [SD] 9.1 [3.4] vs 6.4 [3.4]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Duration of eculizumab treatment was similar between responders and non-responders (mean [SD] 1.8 [1.2] years vs 1.7 [0.9] years, respectively). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Most patients analyzed responded to eculizumab treatment. Of the predictors analyzed, a higher MG-ADL total score before eculizumab was indicative of response. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Greene has received personal compensation for serving as an employee of Alexion, Inc.

Developing a Molecular Taxonomy for Traumatic Brain Injury: A Perspective to Enable the Development of Diagnostics and Therapeutics,2015,"Biomarkers in MedicineVol. 9, No. 7 EditorialFree AccessDeveloping a molecular taxonomy for traumatic brain injury: a perspective to enable the development of diagnostics and therapeuticsAndreas Jeromin, Andrew IR Maas, Andras Buki & Stefania MondelloAndreas Jeromin*Author for correspondence: E-mail Address: andreasjeromin@gmail.com Atlantic Biomarkers, LLC, Gainesville, FL 32607, USA, Andrew IR Maas Department of Neurosurgery, Antwerp University Hospital & University of Antwerp, 2650 Edegem, Belgium, Andras Buki Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pécs & Clinical Neuroscience Image Center of Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS), Pécs 7623, Hungary & Stefania Mondello Department of Neurosciences, University of Messina, Messina 98125, ItalyPublished Online:15 Jul 2015https://doi.org/10.2217/bmm.15.22AboutSectionsPDF/EPUB ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack CitationsPermissionsReprints ShareShare onFacebookTwitterLinkedInRedditEmail Keywords: biomarkersclassificationtaxonomytraumatic brain injuryTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability and one of the greatest unmet needs in medicine and public health [1,2]. It is considered ""the most complex disease of our most complex organ"", strikingly heterogeneous in terms of mechanisms, pathology, severity and treatment, with widely varying outcomes [3]. To date, traditional, unidimensional and insensitive methods discretely categorize TBI as mild/moderate/severe giving little insight into the disease phenotype and individual specific molecular pathophysiology behind the injury. On the other hand, characterization and classification of TBI would require multidimensional approaches able to encompass the clinical reality of TBI consisting of a continuum of severity and a spectrum of pathobiological processes. Thus, there is a glaring need for more objective and informative criteria to support 'softer' clinical criteria and enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis and treatment. Prodigious advances in genomics, proteomics and biomarker development provide unparalleled opportunities for unraveling TBI heterogeneity and complexity, in addition to refining disease characterization, holding promise for precision medicine to enhance patient care and outcomes (National Research Council 2011).Drug development in TBI has also faced challenges due to the heterogeneity of the target population, inappropriateness of conventional clinically based classification of TBI, lack of mechanistic measures of efficiency and safety of the treatment, limited translational value of preclinical data to human studies and the use of variable and insensitive outcomes measures [4]. Consequently, developing a molecular taxonomy for TBI might have a substantial value in drug development setting as well as in clinical trials, which include: • Indicating whether a TBI patient is likely to benefit from a treatment and monitoring the biochemical effects of the therapeutic interventions ('theragnostic' biomarkers);• Reducing diagnostic uncertainty and screening for discrete and specific disease mechanisms, enabling enrollment in clinical trials of more homogeneous patient cohorts;• Being used as a surrogate end point in a clinical trial;• Generating data regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms and describing novel molecular patterns that can represent an innovative approach for drug discovery.Markers for reliable diagnosis, accurate classification and to track disease course are indispensable for research development and patient care.The current status of biomarkers toward an improved taxonomy for TBIBiochemical markers have been proposed to offer additional value for better characterization and categorization of TBI in individuals, potentially leading to more targeted pathways for clinical management and care by tailoring intervention to patient-specific pathophysiology and phenotype [3]. Three main directions of clinical research on biomarkers in TBI can be recognized in the acute and sub-acute phases. In the more chronic phases, biomarkers may indicate ongoing progressive damage with neuronal and glial cell loss.Biomarkers can potentially be used to differentiate between neuronal and glial damage [5], thus reflecting the central pathogenic processes in TBI, but also extend to inflammatory, neurodegenerative and regenerative processes and alterations of the blood–brain barrier.Discoveries and progress in the evaluation of multimodal biomarkers in TBI have been previously described [6] and are not the subject of this article. Based on the specific clinical utilities and applications, different technologies and modalities (imaging and blood-based biomarkers) serve complementary roles and their comparative value will have to be established in prospective studies. An integrated multidisciplinary approach using biomarkers and imaging-based assessments to improve diagnosis and classification is required. This vision is now being realized within the International Initiative for Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR), a collaboration of funding agencies [7]. For example, in the USA, the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot Study, a NINDS-funded multicenter, prospective, collaboration has tested and refined Common Data Elements and explored neuro-imaging standards, and best practices for genetics and biomarkers in TBI studies [8,9]. Several international collaborative efforts are starting or ongoing in Europe such as CENTER-TBI [17,10] and TBICARE [18].Biomarker panels are providing new insights into the biology of disease. Broader definitions include general laboratory values, genetic disposition, metabolomic data and results of neuroimaging studies (CT, MR, DTI, etc). To date, a variety of putative markers with potential clinical utility in TBI and which provide opportunities for the development of a classification scheme based on molecular profiles have been discovered [11–14]. Ideally, biochemical biomarkers for TBI should be brain-specific and also appear early after injury. Nevertheless, many general lab assessments, which are routinely performed, may provide important therapeutic and prognostic information. Some laboratory parameters may mainly reflect the degree of injuries, but others may be related to progressive damage and delayed recovery processes. For example, coagulopathy can cause more rapid increase of contusional lesions, hyperglycemia may aggravate pathophysiological pathways and hyponatremia may enhance cerebral edema. Despite a large number of biomarker studies in TBI, there is no hard high level evidence that biomarkers can make the key transition from technically demanding research tools to robust clinical management tools that can be used in everyday practice. Besides relatively small patient numbers in studies, other specific issues confound an easy and simple transition. These include heterogeneous characteristics of patient population, brain specificity, transport from brain to blood, influence of sample handling and requirements for analytical standardization. Different transport mechanisms (resorption into capillaries versus drainage into the CSF) will influence time profiles and biomarker levels may not only depend on the extent of cellular damage but also in particular on the degree of edema formation, which may be indirectly related to blood pressure.Initiatives in other CNS disorders to develop molecular taxonomies & their relevance to TBISimilar strategies are being developed in other CNS diseases such as neurodegeneration (AD, PD), oncology and other therapeutic areas. CSF biomarkers which track the key elements of Alzheimer's pathology, have been developed [15] to the point that revised diagnostic criteria for AD incorporating biomarker information as diagnostic adjuncts in predementia stages have been published by the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute of Aging of the NIH [19]. Importantly, such efforts demonstrated a substantial biological variability for biomarkers in addition to intercenter and interlaboratory variation (due to preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical factors) across studies, highlighting the need for extensive standardization at different levels. To overcome this situation, several standardization efforts have been initiated and an international quality control (QC) program by the Alzheimer's Association was launched in 2009 [16] to monitor analytical variability for CSF biomarkers and to provide a network where sources of variation could be identified. The TBI community should learn these lessons and use as a foundation to guide further biomarker development and improvement.Future perspective & ConclusionThe current unidimensional approach to TBI classification has caused us to be like the prisoners chained in Plato's cave watching shadows projected on the wall. A multimodal biomarker profile offers opportunities to characterize and refine categorization and risk stratification of patients with TBI by informing on the pathological characteristics of the injury, and pathophysiological response of the brain.However, only an integrated approach combining use of biochemical and genetic markers and advanced imaging with clinical examination will determine the release from the cave and allow us to perceive the true form of TBI. This improved multidisciplinary approach has potential to revolutionize our understanding of TBI and offer a real knowledge that may be translated into new therapeutic strategies, ultimately optimizing patient outcomes and decreasing healthcare costs.Financial & competing interests disclosureA Jeromin is an employee of Atlantic Biomarkers and Quanterix Corp.

Strategic aspects of digital business transformation,2024,"The article formulates the essence of the concept of ""digital transformation of business"". The main strategic aspects of digitalization in the modern conditions of the functioning of international companies are substantiated. Based on the results of the research, the challenges of digital transformation were identified, and various types of digital business models were analyzed. The reasons that exacerbate problems in the field of digital transformation of business are formulated. Stages of the process of digital business transformation based on change management are recommended. The differences between digital marketing and digital branding are identified. Digital business transformation is the process of implementing digital technologies to improve all aspects of the company's activities, including optimization of business processes. Among the reasons that exacerbate problems in the field of digital transformation of business can be named: lack of a clear strategy and vision; employee unpreparedness; insufficient budget; cultural barriers; insufficient integration with existing systems; insufficient attention to cyber security; inadequate monitoring and evaluation. Digital business models have great potential to revolutionize almost all sectors of the economy. For companies that want to remain competitive, it is important to understand how to use digital technologies to create new value for customers and develop new business models. The use of digital marketing and branding tools is about strategic, customer-driven business transformation that requires end-to-end organizational change as well as digital adoption. Digital transformation drives the organization to better manage change as a whole, essentially making change a core competency as the enterprise becomes customer-centric system. Digital transformation has become an integral part of modern business. It allows companies to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, improve operational efficiency and create new opportunities for growth and scaling. Companies that do not adopt digital technologies risk being left behind by their competitors. Digital tools allow to optimize business processes, improve the quality of products and services, as well as offer customers new opportunities, improve communications with them, and create a more personalized experience for customers. Automation of routine tasks, optimization of business processes, use of cloud technologies – all this allows to reduce costs and increase productivity. At the same time, digital technologies (AI, Internet of Things) open up new opportunities for creating innovative products and services.","['strategic', 'aspects', 'digital', 'business', 'transformation']"
ELISPOT assays and their diagnostic potential in Lyme disease and Lyme neuroborreliosis,2020,"Dear Editor, We have read the research article entitled ‘Prospective comparison of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays for the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis’ by van Gorkom T et al., published in Clinical and Experimental Immunology [1]. We want to congratulate the authors for the publishing of this article, and make some remarks and contributions. In the article mentioned above, two assay systems for detection of reactive T-cells against a certain stimulus, in their case Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (B. burgdorferi), respectively the determination of T-cells from suspected neuroborreliosis patients were compared. The positive antibody index (AI) for the detection of intrathecal B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies is, at the moment, the only available Borrelia-specific laboratory diagnostic procedure for neuroborreliosis determination according to the guidelines by the European Federation of Neurological Societies [2]. However, this intrathecal antibody production can be false-negative in 21–45% of all patients, or remains positive for long time periods after antibiotic treatment [3, 4]. Approaches for overcoming these problems are for example measuring intrathecal levels of CXCL13 as potential biomarkers [5]. The idea of using a well-defined, established T-cell based system like the LymeSpot assay for determining neuroborreliosis patients would be a precious contribution to the current diagnostic situation. As manufacturer of one of the tested systems, we stayed in close contact with the first author and have had some interesting discussions about the study in the past. Based on discussions on a highly scientific level, as well as collegial and cooperative interaction, we want to state our point of view regarding the authors’ claim that: ‘Both the in-house and the LymeSpot assay are unable to diagnose active Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) nor to monitor antibiotic treatment success’ in this letter. One key point of the LymeSpot assay is, that the intended use is not for the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in patients, as this disease is immunological completely different to other Borrelia-caused disease patterns like Lyme arthritis or Lyme borreliosis (LB). In this letter, we would like to give a short, but more differentiated explanation on the kit and the intended use. The ELISPOT detects the number of antigen-specific T-cells based on their cytokine production and measures cell-mediated immune responses: in-vitro confrontation of lymphocytes with specific antigens (e.g. from a certain pathogen) [6]. A significant T-cell reactivity upon stimulation with Borrelia proteins is well-known and well-proven; it correlates with the clinical pattern and symptoms [7, 8]. As of right now, the EliSpot technique is the gold standard [9] for different applications in the field of infectious diseases, for autoimmunology, for transplantation diagnostics [10, 11], allergy (therapy monitoring) [12] and for vaccination studies. LB, which was first described in the 1970s, represents the most frequent vector-borne disease in many European countries and in the United States [13, 14]. B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of LB belongs to the family of Spirochaetaceae. Comparable with other Spirochaetaceae infections, LB occurs in three stages, early localized, the disseminated and the late stage. A broad and wide range of clinical symptoms and incubation times mark the three stages of LB. Each stage can be skipped and self-limitation in each stage is possible. The incubation period differs from 3 to 32 days in the early stage of LB, to several weeks or months in a late stage or stage of manifestation. According to this, the diagnosis/detection of LB is delayed [15]. While a protective effect of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi was shown in literature, the systemic manifestation of LB has been reported in spite of high antibody titers. These argue for the role of cell-mediated immunity in the processing of LB [16-18]. As mentioned, the LymeSpot, and therefore the detection of Borrelia-specific T-cell reaction, could be helpful with unclear serological results, unclear (remaining) clinical symptoms, evaluation of therapy (especially in late stage) and therapy monitoring, as indicated in the intended use [18, 19]. With the EliSpot (iSpot), 235 patients suspected for or with reported tick bites in the past were tested for reactive T-cells after stimulation with Borrelia antigens (AID GmbH ELSP5905 Borrelia B31 lysate; concentration: 5 μg/ml (ready to use); purified bacterial lysate from B. burgdorferi strain B31; and ELSP5946 Borrelia Osp-Mix; concentration: 5 μg/ml in AIM-V (ready to use); pool of 9 mer – 11 mer peptides from OspA (B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, B. garinii), native OspC (B. afzelii) and recombinant p18). Of these 235 cases, 30 samples were tested as positive (SI ≥ 3) and 18 as borderline (SI 2–3). This corresponds to a prevalence of 20, 4% within the tested patient cohort. Bases for the test were the above mentioned rules for EliSpot evaluation (negative control ≤ 10 spots, positive control ≥ 50 spots) and the AID developed scheme for LymeSpot interpretation (EliSpot with Borrelia B31 and OspMix antigens). The scheme is included in the kit and antigen package insert. From our point of view, an interferon (IFN)-y ELISPOT as only cytokine used in the study from van Gorkom et al., with Borrelia-specific antigen stimulation of peripheral blood cells is not sufficient to describe a complex immunopattern like in neuroborreliosis, compared to Borrelia patients with other clinical appearance. As the authors describe, spot numbers increase when testing CSF, which makes much more sense in case of neuroborreliosis compared to testing the peripheral blood cells, as ‘the accentuated response in the CSF reflects an autonomy of the intrathecal B. burgdorferi-specific T-cell response’[8]. In the ‘EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of European Lyme neuroborreliosis’ [2], for the diagnosis and confirmation of neuroborreliosis, the determination of an intrathecal Borrelia antibody titer is crucial, as serum antibody titers are not necessarily correspond with the disease state. The function of the blood–brain barrier together with a seroprevalence ranging from 4 - 21% in the normal healthy population underlines the importance of specialized diagnostics, for example T-cell reactivity in CSF in suspected neuroborreliosis and not from sera. Furthermore, it has been shown for other CNS infections such as VZV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 that stimulation of liquor cells (or cells from other extra sanguine fluids) alone has a limited significance as diagnostic tool due to the limited number of antigen-presenting cells and might lead to false-negative results; therefore, the specific immune cells need co-stimulation from blood cells to detect specific T-cell immune answers [20]. Beside this approach, combination of different cytokines beside IFN-y could elucidate T-cell reactivity in cases of neuroborreliosis patients from sera, which is a current focus in a research project with the University of the Saarland. ‘not much is known about the T-cell dynamics after treatment and controversial data have been published regarding this subject. Therefore, this needs to be further elucidated, and we are currently following the active Lyme neuroborreliosis patients both serologically and immunologically (through Borrelia EliSpot) at different time-points up to two years after inclusion’. The study population of active LNB included in the study by Gorkom et al. [1] included 6 out of 18 patients with suspected LNB because of the lack of intrathecal antibodies against Borrelia. The interesting study population in this case would be the correlation of the remaining twelve patients with definite active LNB and the EliSpot result, which was missing in the results and discussion part, at least their Table 1b, which is not included but shortly mentioned in the manuscript. We would like to point out that this approach for monitoring is exactly the kind of data which is needed but still missing in the most clinical trials regarding Borrelia patients. Only with characterized groups, follow ups for longer time periods and the use of different diagnostic methods it will be possible to improve Borrelia diagnostics and gain a clearer understanding of individual immune reactions to this spirochete. ""One approach for example is an ongoing clinical study, the VICTORY project. VICTORY is a prospective two-gate case–control study. We strive to include 150 patients who meet the European case definitions for either localized or disseminated LB. In addition, we aim to include 225 healthy controls without current LB and 60 controls with potentially cross-reactive conditions. We will perform four different cellular tests in all of these participants, which will allow us to determine sensitivity and specificity. In LB patients, we will repeat cellular tests at 6 and 12 weeks after start of antibiotic treatment to assess the usefulness as ‘test-of-cure’. Furthermore, we will investigate the performance of the different cellular tests in a cohort of patients with persistent symptoms attributed to LB"" [21]. We would also appreciate such well-considered studies for patient groups to clarify the diagnostic potential and usefulness of cell-based test systems adjusted to a highly challenging immunological subject as the neuroborreliosis.

Special issue on responsible IS research for a better world,2022,"The notion that there is a moral obligation for researchers to make the world a better place is not new, yet one seldom encounters substantive research that practically espouses such a view. Noting the lack of such research, Walsham (2012) made an impassioned call to arms in a short article titled 'Are We Making the World a Better Place with Information Systems?'. Providing further evidence of the critical need for responsible research, scholars have formed a new virtual organisation named 'Responsible Research in Business and Management' (RRBM). RRBM has the avowed focus of 'inspiring, encouraging, and supporting credible and useful research in the business and management disciplines' (http://rrbm.network). In 2019, the ISJ issued a call for papers for a special issue to encourage our colleagues to contribute to making the world a better place. Following Majchrzak et al. (2016), we suggested that contributing authors should not limit their research designs and thus contributions to the scholarly community but should also consider the practical and policy implications for a wide range of practitioners (not only managers) as well as the broader social world. Finally, they could also consider the non-human world of the environment, given our focus on making the world a better place through IS research. Thirty-nine papers were submitted to the special issue and six have, after extensive revision, been accepted. They are introduced below. We suggest that there are many different ways in which responsible research can lead to a better world. Beyond the interests of individual organisations, scholars also need to consider the grander scheme of how research can make the world a better place, not only in economic terms, but also socially, personally and environmentally. Occasionally we see articles in which it is clear that the authors are pursuing an agenda that aims to contribute to 'making the world a better place'. Examples include: Zheng and Yu's (2016) study of the socialised affordances of social media in the processes of collective action, with a detailed examination of the 'Free Lunch for Children' charity in China; Tim et al.'s (2017) exploration of how the boundary-spanning competences of social media function as a digital response mechanism in natural disasters; and Díaz Andrade and Doolin's (2016) account of how Information and Communication Technologies contribute to the social inclusion of newly settled refugees. But these examples are too few and far between. Apart from articles that demonstrate the beneficial impacts of social media and IT more generally, a stream of 'critical social IS research' emerged in the 1990s focusing on the social and ethical implications of technology in organisations and society. Critical IS researchers have explored how IS that was deployed with the objective of increasing efficiency and instrumental rationality often also increased managerial or social control, surveillance and domination, with negative social consequences in organisations and society (see Howcroft & Trauth, 2005). Thus, the purpose of critical IS research has been to contribute knowledge with transformative and emancipatory potential in order to make the world a better place. Although recognised as a third research stream (Chen & Hirschheim, 2004; Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991) that addressed practically, socially and ethically relevant questions, critical IS research has remained somewhat outside the mainstream. It is pertinent to note that the ISJ was one of a few premier journals to advance critical research by publishing a Special Issue 'Exploring the Critical Agenda in IS Research' (Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2008). The ISJ further published a Special Issue on 'The Dark Side of IT Use' (Tarafdar et al., 2015a; Tarafdar et al., 2015b) that examined negative phenomena associated with use of IT, phenomena that are often hard to articulate and investigate because institutions are reluctant to acknowledge their existence given their investments in IS infrastructures and IS enabled business models. Notwithstanding these attempts, it does not seem to be an exaggeration to suggest that, for most IS researchers, the notion that they can make the world a better place with IS is far from both their intellectual comfort zone and their scholarly intentions. For instance, Clarke and Davison (2020, p. 484), writing about personal data markets, suggest that 'the research published in this area commonly treats the interests of marketing corporations as objectives, whereas those of consumers are conceptualized as constraints on the interests of the corporate players, and as challenges to the corporations' business models. … Much of the empirical research undertaken in this genre comprises laboratory experiments designed to help clarify how corporations can minimize the cost of persuading consumers into trading off their privacy for a service, for convenience, or for a token amount of money'. Some scholars take this a step further and suggest that customers can be persuaded to disclose confidential and private information voluntarily (i.e. without any compensation) if the organisation is able to establish a dyadic and reciprocal relationship with the consumer. As Zimmer et al. (2010, p. 404) note, individuals have the 'inherent tendency to socially orient themselves toward another. … People are biologically wired to respond in kind to polite social advances provided those advances follow socially acceptable guidelines'. Organisations can thus leverage these inherent tendencies to solicit private information. But does research that suggests ways in which individual privacy can be undermined really help to make the world a better place? Meanwhile, research into 'green IS' often takes the view that a green image can help the corporate bottom line, yet fails to consider whether there are any net benefits for the environment (cf. Elliot & Webster, 2017). Similar concerns afflict other instances of IS research, notably in the management-employee tensions that characterise the implementation of enterprise systems, AI, data analytics, or robotic process automation systems. We are not suggesting that IS researchers should shun these topics, but we do suggest that researchers need to consider whose interests they are privileging, protecting, and harming. There are multiple valid stakeholders: organisations, employees, customers, ecosystem players, ignored customers, those negatively impacted by a company, and whole classes of individuals whose lives are made far worse by the ignorance, reallocation of resources, and misplaced attention devoted when only those stakeholders with primary transactional exchanges are considered, that can be the focus of research. Unfortunately, researchers often unconsciously succumb to the interests of the hegemonic forces (usually corporate entities) embodied in the de facto powers associated with the contexts that they investigate (Davison, 2018). Another example of a missed opportunity to make the world a better place relates to the technology-based start-ups that continue to drive entrepreneurship. McKendrick (2017) suggests that the rapid growth of this sector depends on a variety of technological factors such as: cloud services, low cost open source software, and big data analytics capabilities. In parallel, social entrepreneurship also continues to grow (Zimmer & Pearson, 2018), yet there is little evidence that the latter is a focus of IS researchers, who seem instead to be enchanted by the technology. If we are to make the world a better place, it is imperative to study both the technological drivers and the social aspects of entrepreneurship in the context of a broader ecosystem. In striving to make the world a better place, IS researchers often too easily simply criticise digital enterprises and initiatives (especially in developing countries) for their generation of unequal outcomes, exploitation of employees, provision of inadequate working conditions and engagement in a host of other unethical practices (Sandeep & Ravishankar, 2018). We suggest that this does not constitute the production of responsible research because it provides no theoretical or practical guidance for managing and understanding the many and diverse positive and negative impacts of digital transformation. The Senior Editors for this special issue are Robert Davison (Managing Editor), Andrew Hardin, Ann Majchrzak and MN Ravishankar. We extend grateful thanks to our advisory committee members: Geoff Walsham, Cynthia Beath, Niels Bjørn-Andersen, and M Lynne Markus. We also greatly appreciate the hard work done by the many Associate Editors who worked on the special issue: Alan Wang, Alex Wang, Antonio Díaz Andrade, Bernd Stahl, Christy Cheung, Dimitra Petrakaki, Felix Tan, Frank Chan, Helle Zinner Henriksen, Israr Qureshi, Jonas Hedman, Julien Malaurent, Martin Wiener, Mira Slavova, Ning Su, Rahul De, Richard Heeks, Silvia Masiero. The accepted papers represent what we believe are exemplars of responsible IS. The review and revision process helps us clarify the five criteria of high quality responsible IS research. (1) An information system should be examined which is being used for social good, or the social good value of the information system under study is given a priority. (2) Perspectives representing the full range of stakeholders are studied beyond those engaged in the immediate transactional exchange related to the system. The perspectives should include those disaffected by the system, those ignored by the system, those receiving secondary negative and positive impacts and those affected in any way such that the system's creation and introduction to a varying degree, succeeds or fails to succeed at making the world a better place. (3) Theory is developed specifically for that social goods context. The theory takes into account the compassionate needs of the multiple stakeholders involved. (4) Efforts are made to generalise and abstract the theory back to the mainstream IS literature on IS in general. While such abstraction will lose the excitement to some degree of the research, the effort will help to make clearer how the study of responsible IS is similar and yet unique from mainstream IS. Such differentiation will help to build a community of IS researchers who will eventually (in our dreams) usurp the subcommunities in the IS discipline who prefer to stay focused on narrow economic interests of firms. (5) The discussion includes IT design principles and implications for the subdiscipline of responsible IS. As a relatively immature subdiscipline, the more specific policy-based guidance we can create both for us as researchers and preferably for policymakers, the more useful will be the subdiscipline to turning the tide from world-harming IS to world-enhancing IS. The first exemplar in our special issue is by Giddens et al. (2023), a team that is comprised of two academics and a practitioner. They meet the first criterion by examining how resources affect the use of an information system designed to counter domestic sex trafficking in the USA. Meeting the second criterion, they use a qualitative approach and the conservation of resources theory as a lens to understand the different perspectives of a domestic sex trafficking app, yielding a nicely theorised set of four different types of perspectives. They meet the third criterion by depicting a theory specifically for social goods types of apps in which the heavily constrained resources that are available in social goods are narrowly distributed based one's organisation and technology capabilities. They meet the fourth criterion by generalising their theory to what they call a Resources Model of Information Technology Use that highlights four types of users based on varying levels of organisational and technology resources. Finally, they meet the fifth criterion by describing such an example of IT design principles in the context of resource constrained organisations that are introducing new information technologies as responsible IS research practices. In the second exemplar in this special issue, Nussbaumer et al. (2023) note that large scale disasters present decision makers with complex life and death decisions. They meet the first criterion of responsible IS research by examining a decision support system that is used in the context of emergency management. They meet the second criterion by considering the ethical issues central to their context, while ensuring that they take into consideration the needs of a variety of stakeholders, viz.: researchers and practitioners in public health, and particularly emergency management; the potential victims of a disaster, that is, members of the public. For the third criterion, they adapt an existing theory (ethics by design) to the context of emergency management, ensuring that the interests of a variety of stakeholders are central. Thus, the authors build on the growing body of literature on ethics and technology usage while shifting the discussion toward ethical IS design and development. With respect to the fourth and fifth criteria, the authors demonstrate how an ethics-by-design approach was applied in the development of a decision support system to support strategic level emergency management decision makers. The resulting framework guides the selection of ethical values and demonstrates practical replicable strategies for delivering ethical design that considers multiple stakeholder perspectives. Though firmly grounded in the domain of emergency management, the paper concludes with a discussion on how the ethics-by-design approach could be applied in other contexts. In the third exemplar article of this special issue, Mettler et al. (2023) observe that making the world better through ICT also implies that marginalised groups of society can benefit from and get access to digital services. The authors meet the first criterion of responsible IS research by examining how assistive technologies (AT) can be made more accessible to the people who need them (potential users, family members and caregivers): these technologies usually considerable training as well as advanced technical setup that may discourage less technically-aware or financially disadvantaged people, especially the elderly. The second criterion relates to stakeholders: the authors focus on the end users of the AT devices, and examine the benefits of a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach that democratises access to AT. As a design science project, the article does not respond to normative criteria related to theory. Instead, they demonstrate that participatory and engaged design research with a wide variety of stakeholders is beneficial for the acceptability of the product and the DIY-process. The building instructions and the code for a homecare remote monitoring systems are freely downloadable from the authors' website. The findings are of particular value in societies where elderly people neither choose to live at home with extended families who could care for them nor live in care facilities, but instead prefer to have an independent life at home. With respect to the fifth criterion, the findings are of particular relevance to the growing sub-discipline of health information systems, with a particular focus on the needs and interests of patients and their families and caregivers. In the fourth exemplar article, Ahuja et al. (2023) examine the problems associated with fragmented solutions to grand challenges, such as lack of access to education and healthcare, commonly experienced by marginalised communities. They suggest that responsible innovation (RI) is required, recognising that some digital platforms are adept at generating economic value yet also exploit and exclude certain people and thus fall short on some aspects of the 'social good' criterion for responsible IS research. The authors address the second criterion by addressing the legitimate needs (social and economic) of the full range of stakeholders, with a particular focus on marginalised groups in two distinct locations: a city in southern India, and a community of First Nations people in Canada's far North. In this respect, a salient ongoing issue within IS research and practice relates to the lack of imaginative digital solutions where marginalised populations are seen as equal stakeholders so that solutions are designed to be not only inclusive and non-exploitative but also are feasible economically and socially. Responding to the third criterion concerning theory, the authors utilise the RI framework to demonstrate how digital platforms can adopt RI dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness to address the needs of marginalised populations in India and Canada. The RI framework has been criticised for being abstract and difficult to operationalise. The authors address this issue by demonstrating the operationalization of the RI dimensions within platforms and their ecosystems in our case studies. This then addresses the fourth criterion, as other IS researchers will be able to learn from this operationalization of the RI framework. Finally, addressing the fifth criterion, the authors consider how their study will be of value to practitioners engaged in social innovation, economic development and other services for marginalised communities. The emphasis on responsible innovation that empowers marginalised people, whether in a developing country of the Global South or in a remote area of the Global North, is clear. The authors suggest that their insights from two cases are of value to policy makers who seek to deploy platforms in remote or rural areas in the context of post-COVID recovery, with positive economic, social and environmental impacts. In the fifth exemplar of responsible IS research, Ramadani et al. (2023) dwell on the long-standing question of whether centralised or decentralised strategies are more suitable when attempting to address a developing nation's societal or economic challenges through ICT. They respond to the first criterion for responsible IS research by focusing on the social good associated with health IS in Indonesia. With respect to the second criterion, their inclusion of the local community as a stakeholder, in addition to officials at the supranational and national level, is critical. The third criterion relates to the theoretical perspective adopted. The authors conceptualise ICT-enabled development as a multi-level social process and adapt Coleman's (1990) 'bathtub' model to empirically investigate the interplay of centralization and decentralisation as the two macro-level strategies, as well as how two polar cases at the micro-level link such strategies to their own local actions. The relevance of the study for IS in general (criterion 4) relates to the centralization-decentralisation dichotomy: centralization alters the configuration of local ICT resources and imposes new local rules, while decentralisation complements centralization by enabling local communities to better comply with new local rules, develop local human capital, pursue decentralised ICT initiatives, and, eventually, address local health objectives, which then helped actualize national development objectives. The authors then address criterion 5 by reflecting on the design principles implicit in their study, noting the complementarity of centralisation and decentralisation strategies, and explaining the value of local experimentation. By investigating ICT-enabled national development as a multilevel social process, the study demonstrates that micro-level actors are agents of change capable of autonomously adapting to either strategy offered (e.g., decentralisation) or imposed on (e.g., centralization) them. In the sixth exemplar article, Senyo et al. (2023) observe that while an increasing number of studies have examined the impact of financial technology (FinTech), the issue of how FinTech supports economic empowerment for informal business, which is identified as the 'social good' context for the first criterion of responsible IS research, is relatively neglected. The authors selected the mobile money context of Ghana for the study, noting that some 88% of the Ghana workforce is in the informal sector. Regarding the second criterion, the authors collected data from four distinct groups of stakeholders, reflecting a variety of perspectives: the national bank as regulator; two mobile network operators who provide mobile money services; eight FinTech firms which develop mobile money applications; and fifteen informal business owners, who need mobile money to run their digital business activities. With regard to the third criterion for responsible IS research, the authors draw on institutional logics and a case study of mobile money to develop a theoretical model of mobile-money driven economic empowerment that is of particular value to often-neglected people at the bottom of the economic pyramid as it will help them to create and run informal businesses. The model considers the dynamics that play out between logics, actors and mobile money across three dimensions: regulatory, payments infrastructure and the informal economy. Although the model is developed based on the Ghanaian context, it is applicable to the informal sector and economic empowerment more generally and thus is relevant for other subdisciplines in IS, but particularly the Information and Communication Technologies for Development space, addressing criterion 4. It is also relevant to the sustainable development goals (1, 8 and 9) of the United Nations. Finally, the authors elaborate design principles from their case, noting that the mobile money applications were originally developed for individual consumer use, but ended up being of significant value to the informal business sector as well. We created this special issue not for researchers, but primarily for reviewers in the field of IS. The conduct of responsible IS is not as simple as the study of the economic value of a marketing campaign as is increasingly published in our flagship IS journals. Nor is responsible IS simply the conduct of an open-ended grounded research effort of the implementation of new technology, with little prior expectations or biases. Instead, the subdiscipline of responsible IS consists of researchers with very clear theoretical and ethical objectives: to increase the possibility that IS does good for the world: anything less than that is a disappointment. We suggest that responsible IS represents a new paradigm for IS research: one in which traditional evaluation criteria that prioritise large N, generalizability, and simple scientific validity and reliability assessments do not apply. Instead, reviewers for responsible IS papers should prioritise and encourage the multi-perspective data collection, conflicting objectives, messiness of stakeholder roles, and needs of the underserved that are endemic to such research. What should set a greatly constructed responsible IS paper apart is that it helps to clarify the nature of the problem that is being addressed. It should help to describe ways in which IS is helping the world to be better, and it should serve as inspiration to other researchers to jump into the messiness of such a research domain. Let us worry less about whether a data point has been collected well, and worry more about whether we are contributing to a better future for generations to come.","['special', 'issue', 'responsible', 'research', 'better', 'world']"
Improvement in Cognitive Processing Speed With Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (P6-3.005),2023,"<h3>Objective:</h3> To examine the effect of ofatumumab on cognitive processing speed (CPS). <h3>Background:</h3> In the phase 3 ASCLEPIOS I/II (NCT02792218/NCT02792231) trials, ofatumumab significantly reduced inflammatory disease activity and relapses, as well as delayed disability worsening, in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> We analyzed the change in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score (baseline to Month 24; derived from a mixed model for repeated measures), proportion of patients with ≥4-point sustained improvement on SDMT (by categorical analysis), and time to first 6-month confirmed cognitive improvement (6mCCI; ≥4-point improvement on SDMT) in the overall population and in a subgroup of recently diagnosed (RD; within the last 3 years) patients. Time to first 6mCCI was analyzed in a subgroup with/without (SDMT score ≤43 or &gt;43) baseline cognitive impairment. <h3>Results:</h3> Ofatumumab significantly improved SDMT scores from baseline to Month 24 vs teriflunomide in both the overall (n=492 with ofatumumab; n=468 with teriflunomide; mean age, 38.2 years) and RD populations (n=245 with ofatumumab; n=238 with teriflunomide; mean age, 35.9 years). Mean (SE) SDMT change from baseline was 3.50 (0.358) with ofatumumab and 2.39 (0.365) with teriflunomide in the overall population (p=0.030); these values were 4.29 (0.489) and 2.56 (0.492), respectively, in the RD population (p=0.012). The percentage of patients with ≥4-point sustained SDMT improvement was 25.0% (233/946) with ofatumumab and 19.6% (180/936) with teriflunomide in the overall population (p=0.005); these values were 26.9% (118/443) and 20.2% (91/454), respectively, in the RD population (p=0.018). Ofatumumab numerically increased the probability of time to first 6mCCI (hazard ratio [95% CI]) in the overall population (1.14 [0.96–1.36]), RD subgroup (1.19 [0.93–1.52]), and patients without baseline cognitive impairment (1.23 [0.98–1.56]). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Ofatumumab was associated with more clinically meaningful improvements in CPS vs teriflunomide in both populations. Early initiation of ofatumumab may enhance CPS improvement in patients with RMS by suppressing inflammation. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Benedict has received personal compensation in the range of $10,000-$49,999 for serving as a Consultant for Novartis.

Fatigue and Other Patient-Reported Outcomes in Patients With RRMS who Switched to Ocrelizumab: 4-Year Data From CASTING-LIBERTO (P6-3.010),2023,"<h3>Objective:</h3> To report changes over 4 years in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (PwRRMS) who were switched to ocrelizumab after suboptimal response to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). <h3>Background:</h3> PwRRMS may experience increased symptom severity (particularly fatigue), impaired working capacity and compromised quality-of-life (QoL) despite treatment with DMTs. The CASTING study (NCT02861014) examined changes in PROs over time in PwRRMS who were switched to ocrelizumab after suboptimal response to ≥6 months of other DMT treatment; eligible patients were enrolled into the LIBERTO (NCT03599245) open-label extension study. <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> PwRRMS completing the 2-year CASTING study were offered enrolment in LIBERTO and continued ocrelizumab 600mg every 24 weeks for a further 2 years. Severity of symptoms, employment status and health-related QoL were assessed using SymptoMScreen, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29). Spearman correlation coefficients (SCC) determined changes between SymptoMScreen total score, fatigue item and WPAI domain scores, as well as MSIS-29 (physical/psychological sub-scores), from baseline to Year 4. <h3>Results:</h3> At Year 4, relative to baseline, statistically significant improvements were observed in overall SymptoMScreen score (14.4% [12.4]–11.9% [11.5], [SD] p&lt;0.001) and SymptoMScreen fatigue item score (2.1% [1.6]–1.7% [1.6], p&lt;0.001). Trends toward improvements were observed in other SymptoMScreen items, MSIS-29 scores (physical, 21.16% [20.60]–17.47% [20.12]; psychological, 32.03% [23.68]–23.03% [21.68]) and WPAI scores (work productivity, 22.94% [26.74]–16.52% [21.41]; activity impairment, 29.71% [27.72]–22.93% [26.51]). Changes in SymptoMScreen fatigue item (highest at baseline relative to other domains) correlated with changes in WPAI work productivity sub-score (SCC: 0.327) and MSIS-29 (physical/psychological sub-scores; SCC: 0.563/0.502). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> PwRRMS who switched to ocrelizumab after a suboptimal response to prior DMTs reported improvement in their overall symptom limitations (total SymptoMScreen) and fatigue over 4 years, which may contribute to improved work productivity and QoL. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Kister has received personal compensation in the range of $5,000-$9,999 for serving as a Consultant for Genentech-Roche.

"A rapid, fully automated and highly sensitive <scp>ADAMTS</scp>13 gold particle immunoassay using a routine biochemistry analyser",2015,"Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are pathological conditions, characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and organ failure due to platelet thrombi (Moake, 2002). Two typical phenotypes of TMAs are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and haemolytic uremic syndrome, both of which are life-threatening generalized diseases. TMAs, however, occur more frequently in association with a variety of underlying clinical conditions, including pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, malignancy and transplantation (Lämmle et al, 2005). Therefore, the differential diagnosis of TMAs is critically important and often urged in clinical practice. Among the TMAs, TTP is now well defined by severe deficiency of the activity of the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving protease, termed ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13) (Sadler, 2008). However, currently existing assays for ADAMTS13 activity are tedious and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, we have developed a rapid, fully automated and highly sensitive assay for ADAMTS13 activity, termed ADAMTS13 act-GPI. ADAMTS13 act-GPI is performed using gold particle immuno-agglutination with a biochemistry analyser, such as a Hitachi 7170 automatic clinical analyser (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), which is commonly found in routine laboratories. The principle of this novel assay, which consists of two reaction steps, is illustrated in Fig 1A. The first step involves the digestion of the substrate GST-VWF73-His (Kokame et al, 2003) by plasma ADAMTS13 for 4·93 min between Points 2 and 3. The second step involves the measurement of particle agglutination generated by immuno-reactive lattice formation with the cleaved substrate (GST-VWF10) and two gold particles, coated with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IgG) or anti-N10 mAb (IgG) (Kato et al, 2006), respectively. Anti-N10 mAb specifically recognizes the Y1605 residue, which is exposed when the substrate VWF73 is cleaved by ADAMTS13. The degree of particle agglutination is continuously monitored by the change in absorbance (Fig 1B). The decrease in absorbance at 546/660 nm from 335·43 s to 590·04 s is represented as ∆Abs, and a calibration curve was obtained for ∆Abs and ADAMTS13 activity (Fig 1C). This novel assay can be completed in almost 10 min. Two reagents are essential for ADAMTS13 act-GPI. One is the substrate GST-VWF73-His, which is dissolved at a concentration of 1·0 μg/ml in 10 mmol/l PIPES buffer (pH 5·5) containing 10 mmol/l CaCl2, 5 mmol/l benzamidine, 1 mmol/l transamin, 0·4% argatroban, 0·01% Tween 20, 10% immobilized murine plasma and 3% chondroitin sulfate sodium. The other reagent is a mixture of two kinds of colloidal gold particles, coated with anti-GST mAb (IgG) and anti-N10 mAb (IgG), respectively, prepared according to the method of De Roe et al (1987) using gold particles with a mean diameter of 50 nm. The mAb-coated colloidal gold particles are suspended in 5 mmol/l HEPES buffer (pH 7·5) containing 30 g/l mannitol, 2 g/l EDTA-2Na and 0·08% Tween 80. The detection limit for ADAMTS13 activity with ADAMTS13 act-GPI was determined to be 0·4% of normal, defined as three standard deviations (SDs) above the mean for samples with 0% activity (n = 8). Intra-assay reproducibility with three plasma samples (at 9·1%, 37·2% and 75·9% of plasma ADAMTS13 activity) determined by eight serial measurements was 1·5%, 0·5% and 0·4%, respectively. The inter-assay reproducibility of the same three samples determined on eight different days was 0·9%, 1·0% and 1·0%, respectively. Furthermore, no interference was found with the presence of unconjugated bilirubin (337·0 μmol/l), conjugated bilirubin (359·0 μmol/l), haemoglobin (4·88 g/l), chyle as a turbidity of sample (1550 formazin turbidity units; FTU), or rheumatoid factor (500 IU/ml) in the plasma samples, which were spiked with substances included in Interference Check A and RF plus (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) (data shown in Fig S1). The specificity of this assay was confirmed by measuring plasma samples that were pre-incubated with two anti-ADAMTS13 mAbs, a neutralizing mAb (A10) and a non-neutralizing mAb (C7) (Yagi et al, 2007). Furthermore, EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mmol/l completely abolished ADAMTS13 activity by chelating metal ions (data shown in supporting information, Fig S1). Comparative studies of ADAMTS13 activity were performed using three methods: ADAMTS13 act-GPI, ADAMTS13 act-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a modified FRETS-VWF73 assay (Kokame et al, 2005; Kremer Hovinga et al, 2006). For this purpose, the initial determination of ADAMTS13 activity and its inhibitor (neutralizing antibodies) was performed using a chromogenic ADAMTS13 act-ELISA kit (Kainos Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma samples used for this study were obtained from the following four groups: 20 genotyped patients with congenital TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, USS) (Fujimura et al, 2011), 30 patients with primary acquired TTP (aTTP) with severe deficient ADAMTS13 activity and positive ADAMTS13 inhibitors (>1·0 Bethesda U/ml), 120 patients with a variety of TMAs based on clinical and laboratory data, with more than 3% ADAMTS13 activity by ADAMTS13 act-ELISA, and 30 normal individuals aged 20–40 years (15 females and 15 males). The calibrants were prepared by pooled normal plasma (prepared from 30 males and 30 females aged 20–40 years) sequentially diluted with heat inactivated pooled normal plasma. Plasma levels of ADAMTS13 activity determined by ADAMTS13 act-GPI in the aforementioned four categories are shown in Fig 2A. The correlation in plasma ADAMTS13 activity levels between ADAMTS13 act-ELISA (x-axis) and ADAMTS13 act-GPI (y-axis) is shown in Fig 2B, with the regression line (y = 1·1488x − 3·3263) and the correlation coefficient (r = 0·941). Further, the correlation in plasma ADAMTS13 activity levels between FRETS-VWF73 (x-axis) and ADAMTS13 act-GPI (y-axis) is shown in Fig 2C, with the regression line (y = 1·129x − 3·2741) and r (0·969). The plasma ADAMT13 activity levels, determined by three methods in four groups, are shown in Table S1. In Fig 2D, the correlation in plasma ADAMTS13 inhibitor titres determined by ADMTS13 act-ELISA (x-axis) and ADAMTS13 act-GTI (y-axis) is shown in 30 aTTP patients and 30 healthy individuals, with the regression line (y = 0·8795x − 0·0955) and r (0·988). Although these three ADAMTS13 activity assays operate on totally different principles, the values obtained using these assays were highly correlated. We propose that ADAMTS13 act-GPI could be useful in clinical practice because automation has the advantages of rapidity, high-throughput performance and decreasing human contact with infectious materials.

DIGITAL MEASUREMENT OF EMPLOYEE STRESS AND FATIGUE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTS: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY USING AICOACH,2023,"Effective fatigue management in the workplace is associated with employee well-being, safety, and productivity. Fatigue, often resulting from inadequate rest and high workloads, can lead to decreased cognitive function, diminished job performance, and increased risk of accidents, thus affecting both individual health and organizational efficiency. For this, we introduced an innovative approach to understanding and addressing workplace fatigue. By analyzing the interrelationships between employees self-reported fatigue levels, their perceptions of managing fatigue, and their engagement with an AI-based coaching tool (AiCoach), we sought to uncover patterns that could inform more effective fatigue management strategies. Using advanced sentiment analysis adapted for the context of fatigue and Granger-causality tests, we examined these dynamics over time. Our findings highlight the importance of immediate perceptions of fatigue in predicting engagement with management interventions, underscoring the need for real-time monitoring and adaptive strategies in managing workplace fatigue.

Bringing RPA to the next level using AI,2020,"Introduction: Artificial Perspicacity (AI) is transmuting the digital landscape in every field it reaches. The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) revolution goes hand in hand with the advances that Artificial Astuteness is making to transform industries ecumenical. Ultimately, Artificial Perspicacity augments RPA and its implements to surpass prospects. With this already established, it’s valid to verbally express that the world is gearing up for the robotic revolution. Albeit we are already experiencing many of its applications, there’s still plenty of potentials to tap into. What is RPA precisely? RPA or Robotic Process Automation is software technology, as dictated by business logic and structured inputs, aimed to program applications or robots to perform rudimental tasks, just like humans would, in an automated setting. RPA bots can mimic virtually any human action, emulating and integrating actions with digital systems to execute a business process. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enables organizations to engender virtual workforces that increase process efficiency, truncate errors, and cut operational costs. However, even when enterprises implement RPA, many are challenged with scaling it across the organization and identifying all the potential business processes that can and should be automated for maximum ROI. This presentation will discuss how companies overcome these challenges utilizing AI powered process revelation. Automation has been transmuting the nature of work for over a decennium. It has superseded labour intensive tasks, undertaken perpetual ones, escalated the haste of engenderment and engendered incipient streams of work. Most organizations are already on RPA journey, which has resulted in productivity amendment, cost savings, process time amelioration with perpetual and rule-predicated processes. The commencement of the peregrination involves POCs, pilots, and initial automations. The next frontier is about scaling the 
deployment and adoption of cognitive technologies such as AI, analytics, machine learning that emulate human comportment. The transition involves transformation from running RPA on a few processes to scaling up RPA across the enterprise. This session would deal with strategies & challenges in enterprise wide adoption of Automation - crossing over from RPA to RPA+Cognitive , identifying the right operating model & establishing governance, Leadership & aptitude development , orchestrating stakeholders and board level endorsement. According to Investopedia, Robotic Process Automation is the “software that can be facilely programmed to do rudimentary tasks across applications just as human workers do.” Consequentiality of Robotic Process Automation According to insights developed by McKinsey&Company, RPA offers the potential ROI of 30-200% in the first year of avail alone. This staggering figure is met with the verbal expression made by Leslie Willcocks that “RPA takes the robot out of the human.” Companies and employees are taking notice, which is why everyone is so agog to invest in robotics and its emerging technologies. In essence, RPA is consequential because it is transforming the way businesses operate by availing automate perpetual tasks that are a component of a quotidian routine with a higher degree of efficiency than if performed by a human. Akin to cognitive automation, chatbots, and artificial perspicacity, RPA performs significantly more expeditious and more cost-efficaciously than human resources. Many fear that RPA implements and technologies can be perilous as they take jobs out of human hands. But you shouldn’t authentically worry as there is more to gain than lose when it comes to RPA. To put it into further context, implementing Robotic Process Automation into your workplace can avail with tasks such as monitoring customer activity to discover opportunities to upsell, monitoring client comportment to identify areas of opportunity, truncating cycle times in perpetual tasks to gain competitive advantage, capturing and analyzing bulks of information to provide more expeditious replication times, and more. In a wide range of industries that span healthcare, indemnification, finance, and more, there are many cumbersomely hefty-hitters that have already adopted RPA implements into their processes, including Wal-Mart, Ernst & Puerile, Walgreens, American Express, and more. These early-adopters have benefitted from minimizing staffing costs and human errors with the implementation of RPA technology.","['bringing', 'next', 'level']"
Efficiency Measurement: An Application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) on Natural Gas Marketing Companies in Bangladesh,2025,"Performance evaluation is crucial for companies to monitor their efficiency and economic status. In the context of the natural gas marketing companies in Bangladesh, their profitability has declined, leading to challenges in meeting demand. The main objective of the study is to measure the efficiency and total factor productivity changes. For five natural gas marketing companies, 10 years of data were analyzed to measure efficiency. Both non-financial indicators (input purchase units, workforce, No. of customers, length of distribution network, output- sales units) and financial indicators (input capital, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, total assets, output- profit) are used to measure efficient by applying Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist DEA. Based on the result, newly established companies are more efficient, and the total factor productivity growth is better. To become more productive and move up to the position of an efficient company, the inefficient one should cut down on its excessive input components. The management should optimize employee use and renovate the distribution network with new technology. Innovation in technology and infrastructure development, such as AI systems for operation, leakage findings and maintenance, pressure control, online metering, and metering for all types of customers, can improve technological efficiency and reduce system loss.","['efficiency', 'measurement:', 'application', 'data', 'envelopment', 'analysis', '(dea)', 'natural', 'marketing', 'companies', 'bangladesh']"
"Leveraging Technology and data Analytics in Performance Management- An Exploratory Study on its Evolution: the when, now, and hereafter",2024,"In the words of Douglas Conant of the Campbell Soup Company, "" To win in the marketplace, you must first win the workplace ."" Embedding performance management as a cultural cornerstone is imperative for any organization aspiring to succeed in the marketplace. Campbell's theory of performance (Campbell 1990) defines performance as behaviors or actions relevant to the organization's goals and measurable in terms of contribution to those goals. These behaviors are distinguished from effectiveness, which is the impact of behaviors on outcomes. Performance management ensures efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity by facilitating planning, monitoring, and evaluating individual and organizational performance to achieve strategic goals. Performance management involves goal setting, feedback, coaching, and evaluation to align employee efforts with strategic goals and foster accountability and continuous improvement. Historically criticized for its rigidity and lack of timeliness, performance management has evolved, propelled by technological advancements and data analytics (Swan 2015). This abstract summarizes the critical role of technology and data analytics in transforming performance management systems. It highlights the shift from traditional methods to modern, agile, and data-driven practices, emphasizing the potential of emerging technologies to revolutionize the field further. The study spotlights the importance of adopting these innovations to enhance managerial effectiveness, employee satisfaction, and organizational competitiveness in the digital age. Despite their limitations, the traditional performance management methods laid the foundation for modern performance management systems. The evolution of performance management from criticized models lacking flexibility to agile, data-driven systems has been facilitated by technology, enabling organizations to access real-time performance data and sophisticated analytics tools for proactive decision-making and personalized feedback (Pulakos et al. 2015). This shift marks a departure from static evaluations to adaptive practices empowered by technological advancements (Buckingham and Goodall 2015). Integrating technology and data analytics has revolutionized performance management, leveraging AI and machine learning to analyze vast datasets and uncover patterns in employee performance (Buckingham and Goodall 2015). These advancements have led to the emergence of performance management software, data analytics tools, real-time feedback platforms, and mobile applications, streamlining processes and fostering continuous improvement (Mone et al. 1998; Stone et al. 2009; Pulakos et al. 2015; Davenport and Harris 2007; Garris et al. 2002). These innovations enable organizations to adopt agile, data-driven, and employee-centric approaches to drive better performance outcomes and gain a competitive advantage in the digital age. Organizations worldwide increasingly turn to digital solutions to streamline processes, improve transparency, and enhance effectiveness in the current performance management landscape. For instance, IBM offers an employee feedback and review application that facilitates 360-degree feedback, allowing employees to provide input to their peers, managers, and subordinates. Airbnb utilizes employee performance management software to facilitate feedback and reviews, fostering a culture of open communication and collaboration. Amazon's performance management philosophy, ""radical candor,"" emphasizes the importance of open, honest, and transparent communication between managers and employees, promoting a workplace performance management culture. The future of performance management holds exciting possibilities with the advent of innovative technologies such as neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for real-time feedback on cognitive performance, predictive analytics, and machine learning algorithms for forecasting performance trends, genetic testing, and personalized medicine for tailored wellness programs, virtual reality (VR) training simulations for immersive learning experiences, blockchain technology for transparent record-keeping, and quantum computing for complex data analysis. This exploratory study would employ a mixed-methods approach to investigate the impact of technology and data analytics on performance management. Recommendations include adopting performance management as a culture, investing in performance management software, data analytics tools, and real-time feedback platforms, prioritizing data-driven decision-making, and fostering a culture of innovation and agility. ""By integrating performance management as a cultural cornerstone, organizations can leverage digital innovations to refine and amplify their practices, thus fostering organizational success in an ever-evolving digital landscape.""","['leveraging', 'technology', 'data', 'analytics', 'performance', 'management-', 'exploratory', 'study', 'evolution:', 'when,', 'now,', 'hereafter']"

Introducing Identification Technology in Manufacturing Companies and Their Impact on Business Economics,2017,"1.IntroductionIn the competitive and dynamic environment of manufacturing companies, logistics is an important strategic factor for maintaining the competitiveness of companies. The use of identification technologies in the manufacturing process of companies contributes to increasing the logistics performance. Identification technology used in manufacturing allows management employees to have an almost immediate overview of all ongoing production processes in manufacturing. The use of identification technology ensures smooth logistics processes taking place in manufacturing. Using identification technology saves time in the manufacturing processes, brings about cost savings, and thus has a major direct impact on earnings. Manufacturing companies, particularly in the field of engineering, food, pharmaceutical supplies, or the chemical industry, are users of the GS1 system1 both on the global and local level. These companies are also involved in the formation and development of GS1 standards and are key players in terms of their implementation into business practices. GS1 is a global, non-profit association, dedicated to the creation and implementation of global standards for the use of identification technologies and solutions focused on improving the efficiency of the supply chain globally and across sectors. The GS1 system is the most widely used standard for supply chains in the world. It enables the use of automatic data collection means in all the important points of the supply chain. Thanks to the standards for electronic communication, the physical flow of goods can be effectively supplemented with the sharing of structured master and transactional data between business partners (GS1, 2017).The use of identification technologies in manufacturing companies not only helps to identify the product and to specify what material the product is made of, it also provides information on who its supplier is or other properties of the product. Identification of the product also prevents possible confusion. In order for the product to be included in the information flow, a record of its movement must be made (receipt, issue, transfer). The use of automatic identification is becoming one of the most effective methods of acquiring data.In a system where most of the information is processed by computers, great demands are placed on those parts of the system where the collection, creation and transmission of data occurs. In order for the efficiency of these systems to be further increased, it is precisely this problem that must be solved in an effective way (Benadikova and Mada and Weinlich, 1994).A large amount of individual data and information that does not have too much self-explanatory value arises every day from the manufacturing process, sales, purchasing, logistics flows or any economic operations. The purpose for collecting such an amount of data in each firm is primarily the need for the future use of this information. The future use of information primarily means gaining a competitive advantage and hence economic benefit for the company. Therefore, in order to use the information gathered, it is necessary to put it into context and especially store it in a way so that you can quickly manage to find it again.Automatic identification (AI) is a new type of communication, which uses passive components passing through the logistics chain for the marking, transmission and following automatic identification of information related to these components (Freedom and Latyn, 2003). Automatic identification systems are used where the automation of processes in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector is required. While AI was previously used mainly in retailing, it is currently also used in the area of manufacturing and the management of production processes, monitoring manufacturing operations and material flow, the receipt of goods, storage, handling, and others. (Macat and Sixta, 2005, Svoboda and Latyn, 2003). …","['introducing', 'identification', 'technology', 'manufacturing', 'companies', 'their', 'impact', 'business', 'economics']"

Deep Learning Reconstruction of Lesion-Free Representations of the Brain in Multiple Sclerosis Patients (P11-3.006),2023,"<h3>Objective:</h3> The purpose of this study is to recover 3D-T1 weighted brain MRI scans from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients to reproduce a homologous representation of their lesion-free brain. <h3>Background:</h3> In population-level studies, the comparison of MS brain MRIs with their synthetic lesion-free counterpart may highlight disease-specific variability which may provide insights into MS pathophysiology. <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> A generative adversarial network (GAN) based on StyleGAN2 was trained to generate synthetic healthy brain scans from a 512-dimensional latent variable. Then, each MS brain was projected to this latent-space to recover the latent variable that generates the synthetic 'healthy' brain which is the most similar to the MS brain. For model training, 3500 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs from healthy adults were pooled across the HCP, OASIS2 and IXI datasets. For evaluation, scans from 2398 MS patients from ADVANCE (NCT00906399) and ASCEND (NCT01416181) trials were used. All scans were skull-stripped, resampled to 2-mm isotropic voxel spacing, and intensity-normalized via min-max mapping to the range [−1, 1]. Model evaluation included visual inspection and quantitative measures: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Metric (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the original MS brain scans and their synthetic lesion-free counterpart, excluding lesion mask areas. <h3>Results:</h3> We applied our method to 3D T1-weighted MRIs of MS patients to recover lesion-free brains with an isotropic resolution of 2mm. The generated lesion-free brain scans showed no MS lesions and displayed great similarity to the diseased brain outside of the MS lesion areas, as highlighted by the following metrics: SSIM = 0.99, PSNR = 34.5, MSE = 1.49e-3. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Our method reconstructed realistic lesion-free representations of 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans of MS patients. This method could be generalizable to other neurological diseases. <b>Disclosure:</b> Mr. SPINAT has received personal compensation for serving as an employee of Therapanacea.

Robot-assisted transcranial Doppler versus transthoracic echocardiography for right to left shunt detection: “Real World” First-Look (S20.003),2023,"<h3>Objective:</h3> To determine if device trial results (NCT04604015) are generalizable to routine practice. <h3>Background:</h3> Right to left shunt (RLS), including patent foramen ovale (PFO), is a recognized risk factor for stroke. A multicenter, prospectively enrolled device trial of robot-assisted transcranial Doppler (raTCD) vs transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for RLS/PFO detection was completed. This demonstrated raTCD detecting all and large RLS at approximately 3 times the rate of TTE (any RLS: raTCD 64% vs TTE 20% [absolute difference 43.4% (95% CI 34.3%–52.5%), p &lt; 0.001]). <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> We conducted a multi-site retrospective review of prospectively collected ""real-world"" clinical data of raTCD for RLS diagnosis. All patients referred for a clinical study at the participating sites who underwent raTCD were included. Outcomes included demographics and rate of RLS detection, all and large (Spencer Logarithmic Scale ≥3), and the results were compared to the results of BUBL. <h3>Results:</h3> 350 patients underwent raTCD across three participating sites. The mean age was 56 ± 13 years compared to 59 ± 14 years in BUBL (p = 0.03, 95% CI 0.20–5.49). Both cohorts were 46% female. The clinical population had any RLS on raTCD in 54% (189/350) compared to 64% in BUBL (p= 0.14, 95% CI −0.02–0.18). Large RLS was detected in 26% (91/350) of the clinical population as compared to 28% in BUBL (p = 0.89, 95% CI −0.08–0.11). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> The same raTCD device that was safe and 3 times more likely to diagnose RLS than TTE in a device trial detected all and large RLS in clinical practice at a rate similar to that demonstrated in the device trial, supporting the notion that raTCD may allow providers to achieve the known sensitivity of TCD for RLS and PFO detection without the need for an experienced operator to perform the examination in routine clinical practice. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Rubin has received personal compensation in the range of $500-$4,999 for serving as a Consultant for NovaSignal.

BENJAMIN SACHS INTERVIEWED BY MARTHA MINOW,2022,"To address the role of law in the ways that work and employment are sites of opportunity but also inequality in the United States, the AJLE editors turned to Professor Benjamin Sachs, Kestnbaum Professor of Labor and Industry at Harvard Law School and Faculty Co-Director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. With thanks for the help from Madeleine Matsui’s research and the OnLabor blog, https://onlabor.org/, founded by Professor Sachs, here is a lightly edited version of the interview conducted by Martha Minow on February 3, 2022.Martha Minow: The current rate of unionization among workers stands at an all-time low of 10.3%. In your article Constructing Countervailing Power: Law and Organizing in an Era of Political Inequality, you propose that social movements and labor law can be used to counter the outsize political power wielded by the wealthy. How can and should labor law proceed: should there be more focus on strengthening unions or on alternative organizations and efforts?Benjamin Sachs: Let me start by saying that there’s an obvious chicken-and-egg problem here, which is true in so many contexts. In my view, we need labor law reform to facilitate the growth of strong organizations of working people, but we need strong organizations of working people in order to lay the political groundwork necessary for labor law reform.And in a more nuts-and-bolts way, we have a filibuster problem. There was a labor law reform effort during the Obama administration that would have made a huge difference, but it was blocked by filibuster. The Pro Act would make a huge difference; it’s being blocked by filibuster.1 The political issue is profound.But, setting aside the political challenges, our Clean Slate Report lays out in 127 pages our answer to your question.2I’d sum it up by saying we need a complete rewriting of the rules that govern the collective organization of workers.The law aspires to enable working people to build countervailing power, but it fails. And yet that’s exactly what we need labor law to do today. We need a law that enables workers to build countervailing power everywhere corporate power affects their lives. That means a law that allows workers to build power at the level of the workplace, it means at the level of the industry and in the corporate boardroom, and it means in American politics also.Such a law would strengthen existing forms of worker organization, and it would give birth, hopefully, to new forms, from Works Councils at the level of individual firms to more encompassing sectoral unions that would represent all the workers in a sector or an industry. A law that did these things could help us build a more equitable politics and a more equitable economy.That’s no small task, but it’s what’s needed.Minow: What opportunities does federalism open for experimentation at the state and local levels to strengthen the labor movement nationally going forward?Sachs: We might make some progress in some states and cities if we could loosen up the rules of preemption. I’ve actually done some recent writing on this topic,3 pointing out a statutory mechanism that the federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, might use to free states to experiment. I have some optimism about that!Minow: What about preemption and other elements of current law?Sachs: Well, as you know, the Supreme Court has constructed a stifling preemption regime.That regime, at first look, chokes off all avenues for meaningful experimentation by states and cities. But there are some exceptions to the preemption rules that leave states and cities some room, interstitial though it may be, to innovate.A major exception, which probably deserves not to be called interstitial, is that any workers who are excluded from the federal law are not off-limits to the states. So if you’re excluded from the National Labor Relations Act coverage, states have the authority to act on your behalf.This includes agricultural workers, domestic workers, undocumented immigrant workers, and under current law probably gig workers. So there’s room there, but—and this is my as-yet untested theory—there’s this little-known provision of the federal statute, section 14(c), which says that if the Board decides that labor disputes in a particular industry are unlikely to affect interstate commerce then the Board has authority to cede jurisdiction to the states over that industry in that state.4 The section has been interpreted to mean essentially that there’s a small-business exception to the National Labor Relations Act. But it can be read differently, and it can be read in a way that if a state offers to, or does in fact, regulate the industry in a way that minimizes the chance that labor disputes in the industry will affect interstate commerce, the Board could cede jurisdiction to a state.On this view, the statute thus contemplates a federal-state partnership between the Board and a state that’s willing to protect organizing and bargaining rights. For example, if the state of California says, we’re willing to take on regulating the labor relations in, say, the fast-food industry, we’re going to give workers these following rights, we’re going to implement the following rules, and we think that that will eliminate or limit the prospect for labor disputes. If the Board agrees, the statute gives the Board the discretion to authorize California to go and do it.Minow: In the meantime, the COVID-19 pandemic has both exposed and exacerbated the gaps in privileges and protections between vulnerable essential and service-sector workers and better-off workers who were able to work from home and adapt to dangerous conditions. A survey of essential workers during the pandemic showed that union members had safer workplace practices and conditions than nonunion members. Is there an opportunity now for the labor movement and union organizing to draw attention to the benefits of union organizing and membership, as well as the tendency of strong unions to reduce inequality?Sachs: I love that question. There’s a lot about the pandemic that ought to spur, and in fact has spurred, worker organizing.On the downside, it shows just how bad things have gotten for so many workers and how, on the one hand, they’re being rightly told that they’re essential and that they’re heroes, and on the other hand, they’re showing up and being required to work in deadly work environments. The upside is that the tightening labor market and conditions have increased worker activism and worker militancy in many sectors across the country, leading to the upsurge in organizing, at Starbucks and at Amazon, for example, including the recent historic union victory at the Amazon warehouse on Staten Island. But it shouldn’t be so hard to organize a union. And that’s labor law’s fault.Minow: So what can we learn from the recent union victories at Amazon and Starbucks?Sachs: I think what the campaigns have in common is incredible bravery of a group of workers who have put up with too much for too long. And the other thing that they have in common is massive corporations’ willingness to deploy every resource, legal and illegal, at their disposal to stop workers from forming a union.The victories are of historic significance because these are, in the contemporary economy, bellwether industries much as auto companies were bellwether industries in the 1930s when union victories ushered in a new era in United States political economy. But again, it shouldn’t be so hard to win a union-organizing campaign. Workers shouldn’t have to put everything on the line to get a union. And the fact that it is so hard is a failure of labor law.Minow: How important is the strike tool for those who are allowed to use it?Sachs: Gosh, it is labor’s most important tool. It is often, and in many instances desirable that it is, held in reserve.But it is labor’s most important tool. Without access to this tool, the labor movement is going to be weakened. And again, we have a story about law. Workers do enjoy a statutory right to strike, but thanks to a Supreme Court doctrine that’s now decades old, employers have a right to “permanently replace” striking workers. This is kind of a sad joke among labor law practitioners and scholars: the law says you cannot be fired for striking; you can just be permanently replaced. In other words, the right to strike has been eviscerated in profound ways.In many contexts now we are seeing an upsurge in strike activity, and you know, there were massive strike waves before there was the Wagner Act.Minow: That tight market in some labor markets may be helpful. It’s risky, obviously. The teachers in Chicago were effective in threatening around COVID-related practices.What do you view as the most urgent reforms that are needed to adequately support and protect growing numbers of gig workers? Is the California reform helpful, and if so, how? What’s promising for gig workers?Sachs: It is a complicated question. My view is that gig workers—like Uber drivers, like DoorDash delivery drivers—are appropriately classified as employees under existing law.Workers and industries ought to be able to have flexible employment relationships, but the definition of “employee” is capacious enough that you could have an Uber-like work system with workers treated as employees. Uber drivers, like everybody else, ought to have the right to form a union.But, as my other comments will indicate, I’m not a huge fan of the existing labor law. Even if we succeeded in classifying gig workers as employees, that wouldn’t be enough to solve the problems that you’re alluding to. The gig sector is one where I think [the] sectoral bargaining approach [might be successful]. Maybe even a tripartite sectoral organizing approach is worth trying. The idea would be instead of organizing firm by firm or bargaining unit by bargaining unit, you would have a union or a group of unions that represent all workers in the gig space. The union or unions would then sit down with the employers in the gig space and maybe also with a state government, and bargain standards and rules for the sector.One of the great virtues of collective bargaining, including sectoral collective bargaining, is that it is flexible, and it is responsive to the needs of a given industry. I’d be optimistic that if you had that kind of structure in a state like California, you could come up with rules that worked for the industry but also protected the workers.Minow: Really interesting. In the meantime, the definitions of “employee” may have become somewhat outdated with work-from-home since the pandemic. And more and more people have digital-related jobs.Sachs: So, you know, work always changes. Work is always changing and evolving, and the law needs to respect that and respond to that. But the fact that someone is working from home should not determine their employment rights; if their terms and conditions of work are set by a firm, then we want to count them as an employee of that firm.I am very worried that the remote work will be our new subcontracting, franchising, and independent contracting. It’s what David Weil describes as the “fissured workplace,” subdividing work and undermining the protections of labor law.5 We have to be on guard about that possibility.Minow: Also the digital revolution: what do you think about the role of AI in the workplace? It’s been much criticized for amplifying bias in hiring and employment, though the Wall Street Journal has a story today about how it can reduce bias.6 In the meantime, digital platforms like LinkedIn and other devices bypass employment laws such as those against racial bias—employers can see a photo before they even decide to interview a candidate. What is promising and what’s worrying about these new technologies when we think about inequality?Sachs: I don’t consider myself an expert on AI, though increasingly I think I need to become one. We have had a marvelous series on the blog written by a Harvard Law student, Hannah Hilligoss.7 What she taught me and convinced me and what seems right to me is that algorithmic hiring methods do not eliminate bias and can inject new forms of bias and compound existing forms of bias. Just like we need better mechanisms for rooting out bias in human hiring, we need to do that for the algorithmic processes too.Minow: Here’s a question I have after watching, actually, a relatively successful effort by a union. Something good recently—the diversity within the relevant group included sharp conflicts over what to bargain for, and it is really hard to navigate, so when some people are working twelve-hour shifts and other people don’t have that situation but instead have worries about objecting to an employment practice without facing retaliation. What are the lessons that can be learned from all these years of union work? We know histories of racism and sexism, and other differences within the employee groups. People allegedly in the same industry really had very different interests, and who speaks for whom?Sachs: That’s a very thorny and important question. One way it’s dealt with, or how unions attempt to deal with it, is by forming smaller bargaining units that have different contracts for different kinds of workers. The upside of separating bargaining like that is that you can be more responsive to the needs and interests of a smaller group of people. The downside is, as you disaggregate bargaining units, you disaggregate power. And so you can be more focused but less effective.Another approach is to have one bargaining unit, one union, so to speak, and negotiate for different job categories. Inevitably, if there’s one table and one contract, the temptation or the risk is that the interests of one group are traded off against the interests of the other. There’s a certain inevitability to that, but it needs to be addressed and mitigated.Some trade-offs we can’t allow. And what segments of the union movement did allow for too long was prioritizing the interests of white workers over the interests of workers of color and prioritizing the interests of male workers over the interests of women workers. The union movement has better addressed these issues in recent years but still has work to do in order to resolve them more fully.When the question is, how do we deal with the somewhat conflicting interests of new hires versus folks who have been around for a much longer period of time, the principles of solidarity are critical.Minow: What about people who are under pressure from their supervisors to lie in order to make it seem like the contract and the law is complied with, when it is not?Sachs: This is one powerful example, of many such examples, of what happens as a result of the power differentials in the workplace, which are far too vast.At the end of the day, you address that by addressing the power differential. Again, that’s what labor law is supposed to be about.Minow: One of the tools to help is transparency—making workplace interactions more visible—but this also could lead to more constraints on workers as they are monitored or otherwise face surveillance. What do you think about that?Sachs: Transparency is important, but even transparency fails if there’s not a relatively equal distribution of power. So I would return to the question of how you empower workers to demand their own rights in the workplace.Minow: Given features of our current situation, what are your predictions or your assessments: opinion-poll support for the workers suggest support for labor,8 and President Biden is perhaps the most pro-labor president in a long time. And the tight job market should help increase leverage for workers. What policy options are possible now? What would you most like to see progress on?Sachs: This in some sense the million-dollar question today. The tight job market will help workers, but workers need a way to institutionalize their power to institutionalize their voice.A tight job market empowers individual workers in certain ways that are real, and I’m grateful for those. But in order to effect systemic change, we need to equip workers with some kind of institutional mechanism to channel that power. That’s what unions are. Institutions now don’t have to be unions like those we’ve had for the last fifty years, but there must be some form of collective organization of workers. To get that you need law; I mean, that’s what labor law is.I was disappointed the PRO Act failed, and I don’t think there’s really much of a chance of that passing given the filibuster. There’s some hope that some of the enhanced penalties that were in the PRO Act will make it through the reconciliation process. And, again, in my view, what we really need is a fundamental reform along the lines we proposed in Clean Slate.9In the meantime, we do have the most progressive general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board ever. Jennifer Abruzzo has been phenomenal. She is trying to rewrite the way that the prosecutorial arm of the agency operates; she is using every possible mechanism she can within the constraints of this broken law to advance the interests of working people. She deserves enormous credit. President Biden deserves credit for appointing her. If there’s one person in the federal government who is really the strongest advocate for unions and working people in my political memory, it’s Jennifer Abruzzo. She should get credit for what she’s doing.Minow: I have so many more questions. I can’t resist one about globalization and the downward pressure on all kinds of jobs—pay, conditions—because of globalization. It affects white-collar jobs, all kinds of jobs.Sachs: It feels like an age-old question at this point. I don’t have a pat answer to the really important question. There are industries that are more or less insulated from global economic pressure, though. If you want to hire an Uber driver in San Francisco, your Uber driver has to be in San Francisco.At the end of the day, if the labor market is bigger than a domestic jurisdiction, which it undoubtedly is, then unionization efforts and labor legislation or employment standards legislation need to be global also.Minow: And I guess my last one concerns occupational health and safety. The Supreme Court has told us that the transmission of COVID in the workplace is not enough to justify workplace protections.Sachs: I hope this doesn’t seem like a non sequitur, but your question reminds me of a student’s reaction to Clean Slate’s proposal for sectoral bargaining. She said, “But won’t the Supreme Court reject such an effort as a non-delegation problem beyond the scope of administrative authority because it is beyond what Congress has specified?” Of course it’s important to think through those doctrinal questions very carefully. It’s true that if you’re going to design progressive legislation, it ought to be designed in the manner that’s least likely to be invalidated by the Supreme Court. At the same time, the justices have so many tools, now, that they’re willing to deploy: the First Amendment, the Takings Clause, non-delegation, you name it—so any progressive legislation is just at risk.We need a new kind of answer to your question. It may be what do we do about the Supreme Court; it may be thinking more and more about popular mobilization. It’s a long-winded way of saying it’s not just OSHA, it’s nearly every area of law. With powerful tools in their hands—like the First Amendment, like the Takings Clause, like non-delegation—the Supreme Court can strike down nearly all progressive legislation. We need a response that’s as broad as the challenge.Minow: Then there’s money in politics, and John Coates’s research says that half the First Amendment cases benefit corporations and trade groups.10Is there anything else I should have asked you? Thanks for electrifying students and pointing them to meaningful careers.Sachs: Let’s talk another time about what the coming generation can do.","['benjamin', 'sachs', 'interviewed', 'martha', 'minow']"
Evidence for Survival Benefit in ALS with CNM-Au8 Treatment Across Three Study Populations (P8-8.004),2023,"<h3>Objective:</h3> To investigate the efficacy of CNM-Au8 for treatment of ALS. <h3>Background:</h3> CNM-Au8 is a suspension of catalytically active gold nanocrystals shown in models to enhance neuronal metabolic energy. Two trials, RESCUE-ALS and the HEALEY ALS Platform trial (Regimen C) did not show benefit on primary or secondary endpoints. Survival analyses from both studies and an expanded access program (EAP) were investigated. <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> Survival analyses were conducted from the two placebo-controlled trials: (i) long-term follow-up of RESCUE-ALS (Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT)), and (ii) 24-week HEALEY ALS platform trial (Phase 2/3 perpetual multi-center, RCT). Also presented are data from a single-center EAP compared to ENCALS predicted survival. <h3>Results:</h3> In RESCUE-ALS, while primary analyses did not reach significance over 36-weeks, analyses of all-cause mortality comparing participants originally randomized to CNM-Au8 30mg to those initially randomized to placebo and followed up to 31.5 months demonstrated a significant survival benefit with CNM-Au8 treatment, resulting in &gt;70% decreased risk of death (5 vs. 14 events, log-rank hazard ratio = 0.291; 95% CI: 0.118 to 0.718, p=0.0115). In the HEALEY-ALS platform trial Regimen C, primary analyses did not show a benefit. Exploratory analysis showed a &gt;90% reduction in risk of death alone or death/permanently assisted ventilation (PAV) at week 24 for the 30mg dose, but not 60mg, when adjusted for baseline imbalances in risk (Regimen C: PAV and death, 4 vs. 1, p=0.028, death only, 3 vs. 1, p=0.057; unadjusted for multiple comparisons). Survival data from the EAP of CNM-Au8 30mg will be presented. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Despite the absence of effect on primary and secondary analyses in the RESCUE-ALS and HEALEY ALS Platform trials, the survival results are notable. Exploratory long-term follow-up from RESCUE-ALS and 24-week treatment in the Healey ALS platform trial provide evidence for enhanced survival with CNM-Au8 30mg. EAP data will be presented. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Berry has received personal compensation in the range of $500-$4,999 for serving as a Consultant for Biogen.

E102 Transcriptomic effects of methotrexate on natural killer cells in psoriatic arthritis,2025,"Abstract Background/Aims Despite limited evidence and highly variable responses, methotrexate remains a commonly used treatment for peripheral joint disease in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Its widespread use is largely attributed to its established efficacy in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, along with its accessibility and affordability. Its first-line use is often a prerequisite to accessing newer, targeted therapies with a stronger evidence base in many international healthcare settings. However, the precise immunological mechanisms by which methotrexate exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in PsA remain unclear. We aimed to determine the effects of low-dose methotrexate therapy on the transcriptomic profile of key immune cell sets in a treatment-naïve, new-onset psoriatic arthritis cohort. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 19 newly diagnosed, DMARD-naïve, adult psoriatic arthritis patients from the MONITOR-PsA (Multicentre ObservatioNal Initiative in Treat-to-target Outcomes in Psoriatic Arthritis) cohort at baseline. Samples were collected at baseline and 12 weeks after methotrexate initiation. CD4+, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA was extracted from each cell population and bulk RNA-sequencing performed. Gene expression analysis of matched pre- and post-methotrexate treatment groups was undertaken and transcriptomic profiles compared (DeSeq2). To elucidate the biological processes involved in the transcriptional response, datasets were subsequently analysed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results A range of differentially expressed genes (log2FoldChanges (LFC) of &amp;lt; -0.5 or &amp;gt; 0.5 and p-adjusted value of &amp;lt; 0.05) were identified across all cell types of interest, following 12 weeks of methotrexate therapy (dose range: 15-20mg once weekly). The majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the lymphocyte (CD4, CD8 and CD56) compartments were downregulated by methotrexate. The greatest number of DEGs were seen within the natural killer (CD56) cell compartment, with a total of 106 DEGs identified. Of these differentially expressed genes, 100 were downregulated and 6 upregulated. In comparison, methotrexate had a lesser effect on CD4 and CD8 T cells and a minimal impact on the monocyte (CD14) compartment, with only 4 DEGs identified. Functional analysis using GSEA, identified DEGs implicated in cell proliferation, cytokine production and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway within the NK compartment. Conclusion This study demonstrates that low-dose methotrexate therapy in psoriatic arthritis patients, significantly modulates gene expression, particularly within the NK cell compartment. Substantial downregulation of genes involved in key immune processes such as cell proliferation and cytokine production was observed. In contrast, monocytes exhibited minimal transcriptional changes. These findings offer new insights into the immune-modulatory mechanisms of methotrexate in PsA, particularly highlighting its novel therapeutic effects on natural killer cell modulation, an area that has been relatively underexplored. These results could potentially guide the development of future therapeutic strategies, broadening treatment options for psoriatic arthritis. Disclosure L.J.

Causal Attributions (Framing),2024,"Causal attributions are an element of a frame (Entman, 1991). Furthermore, a causal attribution organizes the anatomy of a problem within a text. Hereby, causal attributions provide explanations of problems in terms of their expectations, the underlying reasons or the causes that led to one or more problems depicted in the text. Entry connected to framing devices cultural motifs Field of Application/Theoretical Foundation The causal attributions variable is used in both deductive and inductive framework analyses (e.g., Boesman &amp; Van Gorp, 2018; Cools et al., 2024; Van Gorp, 2007, 2010). Frame analyses with a socio-constructionist approach (Van Gorp, 2007) discuss a strong correlation of causal attributions with cultural motifs (Gamson &amp; Modigliani, 1989). However and in the context of journalistic articles in particular, the main aim tends to depict the facts and problems of an event that is being discussed and to be able to understand and solve it. To that, causal attributions are – presumably – more closely linked to the problem definition than to the cultural motifs. In other words, not every problem may be underpinned by a cultural dimension in a press release, but it is far more likely to be underpinned by a causal attribution. References/Combination with other methods of data collection Causal attributions refer to a causal interpretation of an event or an actors’ statement, while also highlighting certain aspects of cultural motifs. This may be a result of “discursive negotiation”. Example studies: Pentzold &amp; Knorr (2024); Pentzold &amp; Fischer (2017); Van Gorp &amp; Vercruysse (2012) Information on Van Gorp &amp; Vercruysse, 2012 Authors: Baldwin Van Gorp and Tom Vercruysse Research questions: What are the dominant frames used to represent dementia and what alternative frames could be proffered? Object of analysis: An inductive frame analysis to examine the various ways in which the media define dementia both in news aggregates and in audio-visual material from the internet. The aim is to find indications of how and what conceptions people gain of dementia through news, audiovisual material, novels, and public health brochures. Hereby, the analysis followed an initial three-step coding procedure: First, the authors conducted the material inductively by coding key terms, with regular feedback moments to discuss potential divergences. This first phase ended when no new frames were detected, followed by an axial coding procedure of the whole material during phase two. Here, every new passage from the material had to be connected to at least one frame package so to verify the pre-defined frames from phase one. Third and lastly, frame packages were created by linking both reasoning devices and framing devices with a cultural theme. Time frame of analysis and analyzed media type: The sample consisted of a representative selection of Belgian newspaper coverage from March 1, 2008 to July 1, 2010. In addition, books about dementia (n=20) were examined together with (audio-)visual material (n=14) based on the search results for “dementia” on www.imdb.com and www.youtube.com. Finally, public health brochures of dementia were part of the sample (n=15). Information about variable Variable/name definition: Frames/frame packages that define dementia Scale: Nominal Level of analysis: In the beginning by paragraph level, then the whole text as the frames began to emerge more clearly. Sample operationalization: A frame / frame package consists of seven elements. These are the following: (1) cultural theme; (2) definition of the problem; (3) cause (why is it a problem?); (4) consequences; (5) moral values involved; (6) possible solutions/actions; (7) metaphors, choice of vocabulary. Values: The qualitative analysis resulted in a total of twelve frame packages (six frames and six counter-frames). Each consists of a central cultural theme, a definition of dementia, the causes and possible consequences, the moral evaluation and possible future scenarios of dementia. (1A. Dualism of body and mind vs. 1B. Unity of body and mind; 2; The invader; 3. The strange travelling companion; 4A. Faith in science vs. 4B. Natural ageing; 5. The fear of death and degeneration; 6. Carpe diem; 7A. Reversed roles vs. 7B. Each in turn; 8A. No quid pro quo vs. 8B. The Good Mother) Reliability: First, both authors coded independently of each other and met to discuss differences. This resulted in tentative frames which were used for further qualitative research of the material. Then, the frames found were discussed with experts (in a workshop setting). Codebook: Description of the sample (newspapers and audiovisual material) can be found at the end of the article (appendix of Van Gorp &amp; Vercruysse, 2012). Information on Pentzold &amp; Knorr, 2024 Authors: Christian Pentzold and Charlotte Knorr Research questions: With which imaginaries do journalistic reports make sense of Big Data? (RQ1) How do these imaginaries evolve over time? (RQ2) To what extent are the imaginaries similar or different across countries? (RQ3) Object of analysis [and analyzed media type]: The project Framing Big Data (DFG 2021-2024) analyzed the media-communicatively articulated frames on “Big Data” in online newspapers and magazines from three countries: South Africa, Germany, and the United States. No visual material was collected or examined. In total, material from 26 newspapers and magazines was analyzed. The time frame ranged from 2011 to 2020 (N=1,456). Articles had to contain the keywords “big data” or “dataf*” (e.g., datafication, datafied) in the headline, sub-headline and/or first paragraph (sampling criteria). To analyze the frames manually, it was assumed that frames are organized according to three levels analysable in a press text. First, the reasoning devices, followed by – secondly – the framing devices (references, argumentation patterns, idioms, metaphors, topoi) and – thirdly – the cultural motifs. Coming from a socio-constructionist approach, a cultural motif is the anchor of an idea expressed in a text (Van Gorp, 2010, p. 7). It is connected to a social problem. To understand this connection, the problem definition, causal attribution, treatment recommendation, and moral evaluation associated with the coded cultural motif were analyzed (cf., Van Gorp, 2010, p. 91-92; Entman, 1991, p. 52). These four elements are the reasoning devices of a frame. They are accompanied by the so-called framing devices which are stylistic devices, catchphrases, metaphors, and references. To that end, for the manual frame analysis on Big Data in the press aggregates, we developed codes for framing devices (1), reasoning devices (2), and cultural motifs (3). All three elements form part of a frame package (Van Gorp, 2007, 2010). To build the frame packages, we followed procedures of both block modeling and cluster analysis. First, a block modeling was conducted – as introduced by White for structural analyses (White et al., 1976) – to prepare the data set for the cluster analysis. Then, the coded cultural motifs, the reasoning devices, and the framing devices that correlated strongly in the data set (a total of 9 variables and 34 codes) were chosen. With that, a hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward method) was conducted (Matthes &amp; Kohring, 2008, p. 268). Binary variables were calculated for each of the codes of the nine variables. Time frame of analysis: 2011, Jan 1 – 2020, Dec 31 Codebook: Public_Codebook_FBD_fin.pdf Information about the variable Variable name/definition: Causal Attributions Scale: Nominal Level of analysis: Whereas the formal categories in the manual content analysis were coded at the level of a single news item, the individual frame elements were coded at the level of propositional units. A propositional unit (= analysis unit) can be connected to several codes that are assigned to either a framing device, a reasoning device or a cultural motif. Not all but some frame elements had to be present in the news item, and at least one reasoning device. Furthermore, at least one reasoning device should be tied to a framing device and/or cultural motif to prove that the propositional unit contains semantic relationships and not just elements of “raw text” (van Atteveldt, 2008, p. 5). Sample operationalization Causal attributions are part of reasoning devices that include a problem definition, a causal attribution, a treatment recommendation, and a moral evaluation. To identify a causal attribution, we asked: What causes, reasons or expectations are associated with big data while others are ignored? How does an articulated cause, reason or expectation shape a concrete problem of big data while hiding others? Either as expectations (following the conviction/hope etc. to …) OR reasons (in order to…) OR as causes (because of …) for big data. (multiple causal attributions can be coded per article; but only one per propositional unit) Values: see Table 1. Reliability: α = .669 [Krippendorff’s alpha, intercoder reliability. A total of seven reliability tests were conducted, five of them during the coding phase and two as part of two pretests. Five coders were involved in four tests, four coders were involved in three tests. All tests were conducted in the period July 2022 to December 2022]. Table 1 Values used for the variable causal attributions described for Big Data (Pentzold &amp; Knorr, 2024).

Towards Data Justice Unionism? A Labour Perspective on AI Governance,2021,"The dual occurrences of constant data collection and use of artificial and autonomous systems in the workplace are having a profound impact on workers’ lives. Workers are subjected to constant surveillance that not only monitor worker productivity but factors unrelated to work. At the same time, machine learning systems are using these data to transform how work is being allocated, assessed and completed and as a result, worker lives and value in the workplace and beyond. Yet governance frameworks for AI have thus far been advanced with a noticeable absence of worker voice, unions, and labour perspectives. In this chapter I will discuss how concerns about data and data infrastructures need to be situated as part of a workers’ rights agenda, the role of the labour movement in advancing alternative governance frameworks, and the potential for data justice unionism.","['towards', 'data', 'justice', 'unionism?', 'labour', 'perspective', 'governance']"
MODERN LABOR LAW: A REVIEW OF CURRENT TRENDS IN EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL DUTIES,2024,"This review delves into the dynamic landscape of contemporary labor laws governing the relationship between employers and employees, and encapsulates the evolving facets of labor rights and organizational responsibilities in the current milieu. The shifting paradigm of labor law reflects a growing emphasis on safeguarding employee rights. Recent trends indicate a heightened focus on inclusivity, non-discrimination, and diversity in the workplace. Legislative reforms and judicial interpretations have sought to fortify the rights of marginalized groups, encompassing gender, race, sexual orientation, and disability. Concurrently, the emergence of remote work and the gig economy has prompted reevaluations of traditional employment classifications, engendering debates on the extension of protections to freelancers and independent contractors. Moreover, organizational duties have undergone transformation, aligning with the evolving societal expectations. Compliance frameworks have adapted to address ethical considerations, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility, amplifying the obligations of employers beyond profit-centric objectives. This evolution extends to the duty of care owed to employees, encompassing mental health support, workplace safety, and accommodation for work-life balance. The review also analyzes the interplay between statutory regulations, judicial precedents, and societal shifts, charting their impact on the employer-employee relationship. It examines the complexities arising from the globalization of labor markets, addressing the challenges of harmonizing diverse legal frameworks and cross-border employment dynamics. It also scrutinizes the implications of technological advancements, such as AI-driven employment decisions, on labor rights. It probes the legal and ethical quandaries arising from the proliferation of surveillance technologies in the workplace, balancing the interests of productivity and privacy rights of employees. The insight presented in this review provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted landscape of modern labor law, capturing its intricate tapestry of rights, obligations, and the evolving contours of the employer-employee nexus amidst contemporary socio-economic dynamics.&#x0D; Keywords: Labour Law, Employee Right, Compliance, Organizational Duties, Review.","['modern', 'labor', 'law:', 'review', 'current', 'trends', 'employee', 'rights', 'organizational', 'duties']"
"National Surveillance for Health-Related Workplace Absenteeism, United States 2017-18",2019,"ObjectiveTo describe the methodology of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) system for national surveillance of health-related workplace absenteeism among full-time workers in the United States and to present initial findings from October through July of the 2017–2018 influenza season.IntroductionDuring an influenza pandemic, when hospitals and doctors’ offices are—or are perceived to be—overwhelmed, many ill people may not seek medical care. People may also avoid medical facilities due to fear of contracting influenza or transmitting it to others. Therefore, syndromic methods for monitoring illness outside of health care settings are important adjuncts to traditional disease reporting. Monitoring absenteeism trends in schools and workplaces provide the archetypal examples for such approaches.NIOSH’s early experience with workplace absenteeism surveillance during the 2009–2010 H1N1 pandemic established that workplace absenteeism correlates well with the occurrence of influenza-like illness (ILI) and significant increases in absenteeism can signal concomitant peaks in disease activity. It also demonstrated that, while population-based absenteeism surveillance using nationally representative survey data is not as timely, it is more valid and reliable than surveillance based on data from sentinel worksites.1In 2017, NIOSH implemented population-based, monthly surveillance of health-related workplace absenteeism among full-time workers.MethodsEach month, NIOSH updates an influenza season-based time series of health-related workplace absenteeism prevalence among full-time workers with the previous month’s estimate (i.e., with a 1-month lag).Data for this surveillance system come from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly national survey of approximately 60,000 households administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPS collects information on employment, demographics and other characteristics of the noninstitutionalized population aged 16 years or older.A full-time worker is defined as an employed person who reports that they usually work at least 35 hours per week. Health-related workplace absenteeism is defined as working fewer than 35 hours during the reference week due to the worker’s own illness, injury, or other medical issue. Because the CPS questions refer to one week of each month, absenteeism during the other weeks is not measured. These one-week measures are intended to be representative of all weeks of the month in which they occur.Monthly absenteeism prevalence estimates for the current influenza season are compared to an epidemic threshold defined as the 95% upper confidence limit of a baseline established using data from the previous five seasons aggregated by month. Point estimates that exceed the epidemic threshold signal surveillance warnings; estimates whose lower 95% confidence limits exceed the epidemic threshold generate surveillance alerts. Estimates of total absenteeism are calculated as are estimates stratified by sex, age group, geographic region (HHS service regions), and occupation.All analyses are weighted using the CPS composite weight and estimates of all standard errors are adjusted to account for the complex design of the CPS sample.ResultsDuring the period October 2017 through July 2018, the prevalence of health-related workplace absenteeism among full-time workers began at 1.7% (95% CI 1.6–1.8%) in October, increased sharply beginning in November, peaked in January at 3.0% (95% CI 2.8–3.2%), and declined steadily thereafter to end at a low of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3–1.5%) in July. The January absenteeism peak significantly exceeded the epidemic threshold, signaling a surveillance alert. Absenteeism remained elevated in February, but not significantly, signaling a surveillance warning. (Figure 1) Peak absenteeism in the 2017-2018 influenza season exceeded that of all of the five previous seasons except the 2012-2013 season. (Figure 2)Analyses stratified by sex generated surveillance alerts for male workers in January and February. Surveillance alerts were also signaled for the following strata: workers aged 45–64 years in January and February; workers in HHS Region 6 in January and February and Region 9 in December and March; and workers in management, business, and financial occupations and installation, maintenance, and repair occupations in January and in production and related occupations in February.Unlike surveillance alerts, the numerous surveillance warnings generated in stratified analyses are not reported due to small sample sizes in several strata.ConclusionsResults of initial analyses for the 2017–2018 influenza season indicate that, among full-time workers in the United States, the prevalence of health-related workplace absenteeism began to increase in November, peaked in January and was significantly higher than the average of the previous five seasons. These findings are consistent with official characterizations of 2017–2018, based on traditional ILI, hospitalization, and virologic surveillance data, as a high severity season that accelerated in November and peaked in January and February.2,3Analyses further suggest that male workers; workers aged 45–64 years; workers living in HHS Regions 6 and 9; and those working in management, business, and financial; installation, maintenance, and repair; and production and related occupations may have been especially impacted.While not timely enough to serve as an early warning system, population-based workplace absenteeism is, nevertheless, a useful syndromic measure of a pandemic’s impact on the working population. It also provides information that can be used to maintain health situational awareness during the inter-pandemic period, to evaluate the impact of pandemic control measures, and to inform future pandemic preparedness and response planning. Absenteeism surveillance can provide an important supplementary measure of a pandemic’s overall impact because morbidity and mortality statistics may not fully reflect the disruption caused to the social and economic life of the community. This is especially true when disease makes people too sick to work but not sick enough to seek medical care.References1. Groenewold MR, Konicki DL, Luckhaupt SE, Gomaa A, Koonin LM.

Understanding surveillance capitalism from the viewpoint of migration,2022,"Surveillance capitalism has recently emerged as a key concept in interpretations of global technology companies' business models as seen in Zuboff's (2019) study analysing the transition of some Silicon Valley companies into global monopolies within just a few decades. In this paper, I argue that this business model has turned into a structural element of modern-day capitalism with implications for migration and border management. Through an analysis of the technological tools being developed and used for migration and border management, the article will help to understand the power dynamics underlying surveillance capitalism. The tragic outputs of technological products for the management of migration and border security have recently entered the agenda of the academic community and activist networks. Studies have shown companies investing in border security and migration management, examine their lobbying activities and argue that refugees are being used as subjects in the development of surveillance technologies (Achiume, 2020; Akkermann, 2021; Latonero, 2019; Molnar, 2020). Analysing these, as a whole, within the scope of the surveillance capitalism provides clues of how enmeshed the interests of technology companies, military and security corporations, security bureaucracy and governments are, (Privacy International, 2021) and the oligarchic form of these interests. Although surveillance capitalism discussions mainly focus on the commercial and political aspects to send personalized messages to users, this paper argues that the manifestation of surveillance capitalism in migration and border management would allow us to understand the development of new surveillance tools (lie detectors, facial recognition systems and sensors) that would eventually affect all humanity. Therefore, this is not only related to migrants and borders, such an analysis will illuminate which direction global capitalism is gravitating through cutting-edge technologies and envisage the possible tech-oriented dystopic future at the end of the road. Since it involves affecting, managing and directing targeted communities in a systematic, routine and focussed manner, surveillance aims to categorize societies and to have those categories of people to act within pre-determined limits (Au, 2021). Even though surveillance had always been a significant subject in the history of class societies, it became a basic criterion both in the workplace and in public life as a result of capitalist developments to maximize the surplus value of the labour force. Surveillance capitalism, on the other hand, refers to the business model describing the sources of income of some Silicon Valley technology companies. The leaps in machine learning and digital technologies (smartphone applications and Internet of things) create enormous data sets, and thus, the status quo can be reproduced through comprehensive analysis using real-time and cumulative data, and as an outcome, the future ""under normal conditions"" can be forecasted (Zuboff, 2019). Many technology companies have access to the data of billions of people thanks to the platforms they provide (search engines or social networks), and they are able to present user-specific/ personalized advertising. In this business model, the most significant promise made to the advertiser/client is the ability to forecast the future. Accordingly, these platforms present advertisements to people who are interested in the products or services offered by a given advertiser. Therefore, this business model will grow by focusing on the collection of more data and generating more to-the-point forecasts, which requires even more thorough surveillance. Once this business model proves how profitable it is, to secure the revenue stream, clearing away the uncertainty in forecasts is of vital importance, and accordingly, manipulating the user will eliminate ""this problem"" (Au, 2021; Zuboff, 2019). States and political bodies very quickly recognized the power of analysis, estimation and manipulation and have used them as an effective tool in the detection and manipulation of floating voters, which was discussed extensively during elections in the United States. Furthermore, the security, military and intelligence institutions have identified opportunities associated with it, upon which they have begun to collaborate with technology companies to become the customers of miscellaneous surveillance technologies (Akhmetova & Harris, 2021; Akkermann, 2016; Delcan, 2019). In summary, the surveillance business model, discovered in Silicon Valley, could easily exceed its own sectoral boundaries and encapsulates the entire system. Migration and border management practices provide valuable examples that can help us understand how a business model takes the historical surveillance inventory of capitalism to an unprecedented level with advanced technologies (Broeders, 2007; Hosein & Nyst, 2013). Technological products that stand out in this field fall within the scope of ""smart borders."" These tools make it possible to control activities beyond borders and to detect immigrants before they reach the borders using AI algorithms, drones, facial recognition systems, biometrics, satellite images, sensors, mobile operators and social media data analyses (Achiume, 2020; Akhmetova & Harris, 2021; Korkmaz, 2020). For example, Elbit, an Israeli security company that established an advanced surveillance system in Arizona, detects people approaching the border from 7.5 miles away. The laser-enhanced cameras produced by Anduril are able to detect all movement within two miles and to distinguish human activity from animal activity (Feldstein, 2019). Both the United States and the European Union have hired private companies to militarize their borders with advanced surveillance technologies. In other words, public funding is being used to pay companies to develop new and deadly technologies rather than ensure the rights of migrants or resolve the economic and political difficulties locals face. For example, the border control and immigration budget of the United States has increased by 6,000 per cent since 1980, with US$223 million of the 2019 budget set aside to Homeland Security for the development of border security technologies. The EU, on the contrary, has allocated €34.9 billion to this field for the 2021–27 period, up from €13 billion for the 2014–20 period (Achiume, 2020; Daniels, 2018; Feldstein, 2019; Sánchez-Monedero & Dencik, 2020). Frontex, which operates on the land and sea borders preventing the movements of migrants into Europe, uses the most advanced surveillance technologies and conducts push-back operations (Human Rights Watch, 2021), barring refugees from the opportunity to seek asylum. In its operations, Frontex uses military-grade drones and has signed a €50 million contract with Airbus for aerial surveillance purposes (Achiume, 2020; People & Planet, 2021). The UK also invests heavily in surveillance technologies. According to a Privacy International report (2021), ADS—the UK's main arms lobby group—has established an Industry Reference Group together with Home Office to lead the process. Within this scope, Future Borders and Immigration System was assigned a budget of £113 million for the development of digital borders in 2020 (Au, 2021). Smart border applications are generally produced by military companies. In other words, those who produce the weapons and bombs that force refugees to flee their countries are the same companies that produce the tools for the detection of those people in border areas. And military companies are collaborating with global tech companies to develop new surveillance tools to detect migrants approaching to their borders. As the security bureaucracy and governments assign, fund and pilot these projects, we observe the emergence of the oligarchical coordination of actors under surveillance capitalism. For example, leading arms sellers, such as Lockheed Martin, Airbus, Safran and Thales, and technology companies, such as IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Fujitsu, and Accenture, all stand out with their investments in this area (Achiume, 2020; People & Planet, 2021). Miscellaneous speculative pilot studies are being conducted in the fields of migration and border management. For example, in a project called AVATAR (Automated Virtual Agent for Truth Assessments in Real-Time) applied in Canada, the United States and the European Union, an AI lie detector algorithm has been piloted. As part of the project, people are questioned by kiosk computers at border crossings and airports, and the algorithm tries to detect whether the person is lying by analysing their eye, mouth and hand movements, and using sensors, biometrics and facial recognition systems, which is clearly concerning from ethical and legal perspectives, beyond criticisms that it is anti-scientific (Daniels, 2018). These projects are usually pilot studies and so are supported by public funds under the guise of academic research. For example, a lie detector algorithm was developed by QinetiQ, a British defence technology company and funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Another project is the iBorderCtrl conducted by Manchester Metropolitan University researchers, which benefited from a €4.5 million grant provided by the European Research Council (Sánchez-Monedero & Dencik, 2020). This project made use of affect recognition technologies and was tested in Greece, Hungary and Latvia (Feldstein, 2019), while another highly criticized pilot study is the UK Border Agency's Human Provenance Pilot (HPP) Project, which aims to detect the nationality of asylum seekers through a DNA and isotope analysis (Privacy International & No Tech for Tyrants, 2020). Can such companies as IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Palantir and Google be described as mere technology providers? Thanks to the huge tenders awarded by the U.S. defense sector, Amazon is now the largest military corporation in the United States. Developing military capabilities is not limited to weapons as Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are in a race to provide cloud system services and digital infrastructures to many military and intelligence organizations, including the U.S. Ministry of Defense and the CIA. They are active in the development of many state-of-the-art combat technologies, such as autonomous weapons and robot soldiers. For instance, the US Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate offers DHS to deploy robot dogs with cameras and sensors on the borders (Department of Homeland Security, 2022). These companies are operating actively at a state level, providing lobbying and consultancy services while enjoying public funds, and as such, they go hand-in-hand and have mutual interests with the military-security bureaucracy (Akkermann, 2016, 2021; Delcan, 2019; Privacy International, 2021). Border security and migration management are fruitful areas for the transformation of surveillance capitalism from a business model to a structural and critical feature of the capitalist system to foster the effective use of surveillance and manipulative techniques on society through advanced technologies. Therefore, when assessing innovation in migration management, one should understand the embedded economic and political interests, thus laying the foundations for objections to the dangerous outcomes of surveillance capitalism. The opinions expressed in this Commentary are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Editors, Editorial Board, International Organization for Migration nor John Wiley & Sons.","['understanding', 'surveillance', 'capitalism', 'viewpoint', 'migration']"
Critical agrarian studies and crises of the world-historical present,2023,"ABSTRACTThis essay examines the global agrarian question as implicated in, and implicating, the current conjuncture of crises by historicizing them – where the past permeates a present, now challenged by a problematic future. I suggest a methodological approach connecting these morbid symptoms to inform a critical agrarian studies, especially insofar as the agrarian world is shaped by, and shapes, global capitalist and environmental relations.KEYWORDS: Food insecurityglobal agrarian questionmigrationsfascismgovernancecorporate capture AcknowledgementsThe author thanks Heloise Weber, Martin Weber, and Geoffrey Lawrence, and two helpful reviewer comments on an initial version of this essay.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.Notes1 Given the recurrence of ‘food crises,’ not to mention being a constant presence for particular regions and populations during the colonial era through to the present (cf. Patel and Moore Citation2017; Patel Citation2012).2 Exemplified in classical economic theory, where the rural delivers ‘unlimited supplies of labour’ for economic development, given ‘disguised unemployment’ in agriculture. See Lewis (Citation1954), and Ranis and Fei (Citation1961).3 See Beckert et al. (Citation2021).4 See Chowdhury (Citation2022), and Menon (Citation2022).5 Fishman (Citation2022). And, this may well continue, despite Lula’s presidential victory in October 2022: Duran (Citation2022).6 For example, the chief executive of Obria, an anti-choice and anti-contraception organization in the US, amply funded by the Trump administration, claims Christianity is dying out because of contraception and abortion, with the effect of ‘replacing’ Europeans with immigrant Muslims (Kirchgaessner Citation2019). And, see Hedges (Citation2022).7 Thus, ‘fascists achieve power by creating parallel institutions – schools, universities, media platforms and paramilitary forces – and seizing the organs of internal security and the judiciary. They deform the law, including electoral law, to serve their ends. They are rarely in the majority’ (Hedges Citation2022).8 Cf., Patnaik (Citation2021).9 Including right-wing rural populism, Borras (Citation2019), and TNI (Citation2020). For case studies, see Bello (Citation2019).10 Serving to build alliances among repressive states.11 See also Badham (Citation2022), and Bello (Citation2019).12 ‘Stop the Steal is a metaphor’ for shared grievance of this Republican-inspired movement: ‘a belief that their status is under threat from Obama-like interlopers, by a liberal media, by those movements demanding visible equality in the culture. That they are losing control’ (Skocpol, quoted in Bardhan Citation2022).13 Cf., Patel and McMichael (Citation2004).14 See, e.g. Bello (Citation2019).15 Cumming-Bruce and Ramzy (Citation2022), see also Friedman (Citation2022).16 In 2023, 85% of the world’s population would experience stringent austerity according to Oxfam (Citation2022).17 For PM Modi’s rejection of welfare entitlements in the sadistic name of ‘self-reliance,’ see Menon (Citation2022).18 Similarly for Australia: Denniss (Citation2022).19 Notably, Rodrik underscores this is not a return to Keynesianism policies of redistribution, social transfers, and macroeconomic management, rather a response to ‘economic populism.’ See also: Stiglitz (Citation2022).20 G-20 challenges at the 2003 Cancun Ministerial – US Trade Representative warned: ‘As WTO members ponder their future, the US will not wait: we will move towards free trade with can-do countries’ (quoted in Bello Citation2020).21 See also ETC Group (Citation2022): https://www.etcgroup.org/content/food-barons-202222 Relatedly, ‘At the beginning of the twenty-first century, both digital and offshore realms fused to constitute an extraterritorial capitalist system of sorts, turning elites invisible whilst subjecting the rest of society to mass surveillance’ (Hendrikse Citation2021, 73). See also Zuboff (Citation2019).23 Here, ‘the rollout of data-driven technologies increasingly requires the rollback of liberal protections by design, in order to make way for a political economy based on mass surveillance and AI’ (Hendrikse Citation2021, 84).24 La Vía Campesina: https://viacampesina.org/en/a-g8-on-agriculture-without-farmers-more-hunger-and-poverty/25 https://projects.itforchange.net/state-of-big-tech/agritech-and-food-systems-in-latin-america-corporate-takeover-and-elements-for-a-human-rights-based-alternative/26 Especially previous food and financial crises, and conventional neoliberal responses, notably the ‘institutionalization of public-private partnerships (PPP’s). See Patel and McMichael (Citation2009).27 Cf., the well-known phrasing from Marx (Citation1852): ‘Hegel remarks somewhere that all great, world-historical facts and personages occur, as it were, twice. He has forgotten to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.’28 McMichael and Schneider (Citation2011).29 See also Bello (Citation2022b).30 Following the World Bank’s 2008 World Development Report, which, for the first time in a quarter of a century recognized smallholder farming (McMichael Citation2009).31 Contrarily, a subsequent UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Report on Smallholders noted: ‘Smallholders are engaged in a variety of markets. They are present above all in local informal markets which are easier for them to access; this is particularly the case for women’ (Citation2015, 1).32 https://viacampesina.org/en/civil-society-declaration-of-the-terra-preta-forum/ (emphasis added). This author assisted Shalmali Guttal in formulation of this declaration, overseen by Maryam Rahmanian.33 IPES-Food (Citation2017), including profiteering by the ‘food barons’ (ETC Group Citation2022).34 In 2020, the pandemic increased hunger by 8.4%, with 811 million undernourished, with another 40 million facing acute food insecurity (IPES-Food Citation2022, 4). This figure was 828 million in 2022: https://www.worldhunger.org/35 Flora Sorkin of the Society for International Development. https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2022/07/world-bank-and-imfs-response-to-global-food-crisis-misses-mark-as-financial-speculation-drives-food-prices-to-historic-highs/?utm_source=emailmarketing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_bretton_woods_observer__summer_2022_out_now&utm_content=2022-08-1636 China’s holdings of over half of the global grain stock also affects prices (Joles Citation2022).37 See, for example, Davis (Citation2000), on British merchant and telegraph technology capturing wheat from village grain reserves, in India, and China, in addition to enclosing lands/forests, provoking famines.38 Cf., Yaşin (Citation2022).39 Cf., Araghi (Citation2003).40 As a concrete example, in 1998 I keynoted a conference in Manizales, Colombia, on world-economic trends, organized by the National Coffee Growers Federation (FEDECAFE) – which was experiencing intensified competition in the global marketplace from new coffee growing countries, such as Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Honduras … 41 Deterritorialization may include ‘agro-security mercantilism’ (McMichael Citation2013c), led by Saudi Arabia and South Korea, and other Gulf and East Asian states, with state-led securing of food producing land offshore in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America (Makki Citation2013; Cochrane and Amery Citation2017; Townsend Citation2020; Henderson Citation2022).42 Stead and Hinkson (Citation2022).43 Carrington (Citation2018). An alternative crisis perspective is that the global food system ‘is not broken … It is working precisely as a capitalist food system is supposed to work: it expands constantly, concentrating wealth in a few, powerful monopolies, while transferring all the social and environmental costs onto society’ (Holt-Giménez Citation2019, 89).44 https://grain.org/en/article/6790-peasants-still-feed-the-world-even-if-fao-claims-otherwise45 In its many guises (Shattuck, Schiavoni, and VanGelder Citation2019), even as it registers the offensive against national/sovereign agri-food policy, biodiversity, as well as the assault on domestic farming cultures.46 Palumbo and Corrado (Citation2020).47 CFS (Citation2022/2012). The Tenure Guidelines informed land struggles in India, Mali, Uganda, Argentina, and Italy (Nora Citation2013), though recent assessments suggest uneven implementations.

The CSIPM critiqued the V0 draft of the CSIPM’s Data Working Group on the v0 Draft: Data collection and analysis tools for food security and nutrition (2022), pointing out that focusing on data only, net of the ‘infrastructures of data collection, distribution, processing an ownership, the report evades key issues about the political economy and physical impacts of data.’64 The recent attempt to refashion Chile’s constitution (inherited from the Pinochet dictatorship), while an overreach at thie point for about 60% of the citizenry, nevertheless is a promising reminder of such possibility with its attention to social, ecological and reproductive rights.65 This term comes from Bové and Dufour (Citation2002). The UN, WHO and the WTO all responded to the pandemic supply chain crisis by simply encouraging open borders. While offering short-run international access to some food, it bypassed the need for long-run re-imagining of (emissions-reducing) domestic food security conditions.66 See, e.g. Bello (Citation2022b).67 E.g. Wittman, James, and Mehrabi (Citation2020.

Meanwhile, movement of peoples is increasingly politicized – where northern states elaborate and export border controls to the Global South, which function ‘as a technology of spatial control that upholds regimes of racialized exploitation and dispossession’ (Friedman Citation2022).75 This concept, rehabilitating agrarianism vs. a ‘planet of slums’ (Davis Citation2005), complements Ajl’s ‘planet of fields’ proposal: ‘It means drawing on the best of the past, not as a curio, retrograde ‘traditionalism, or out of nostalgia, but to find the way to a better future’ (Ajl Citation2021, 118).

Such a balance has been rendered somewhat problematic following devastating climatic effects in China: Nierenberg (Citation2022) and Bossons (Citation2022).90 Unlike the initial industrial source, coal, which, in requiring extraction by concentrations of miners, was more vulnerable to industrial strife (see Mitchell Citation2011).91 And, here it is important to note that ‘If the US military were an independent state, it would be the 47th largest polluter in the world, slotted between Peru and Portugal’ (Ajl Citation2021, 155).

Relatedly, the ongoing pervasive commodification of life prepares conditions for anti-capitalist political alliances founded in production and social reproduction domains (Harvey Citation2017; Moore Citation2023) – integrating demands, for example, from workplaces including farmwork and teaching, through renters and consumers, to healthcare providers to small/family farmers (cf, Selwyn Citation2016; Fraser Citation2013; Caouette and Kapoor Citation2015).104 E.g. ‘climate-smart,’ ‘nature-based,’ ‘innovation,’ stakeholder.’105 Between Colombia and Panama. https://www.cfr.org/article/crossing-darien-gap-migrants-risk-death-journey-us106 https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb9997en/107 See Halperin (Citation2021) for a longue durée perspective on far right political histories.108 Here, the ‘harnessing of fossil fuel power seemed, for a couple of centuries at least, to have freed large parts of humanity from the need to be in constant dialogue with nature … Now the cumulative effect of those centuries of burned carbon is in the process of unleashing the most ferocious natural tempers of all’ (Klein Citation2014, 175).109 Quijano (Citation2000). This theme shapes Patel and Moore’s (Citation2017) account of the historic cheapening of minority lives, nature, money, energy, work, food, and care, as integrated dimensions of capitalist modernity.110 As Malm notes: ‘The significance of that terrible destiny, so often warned of in climate change discourse, is the final falling in of history on the present’ (Citation2016, 9).111 As early as 1965, the president of the American Petroleum Institute reported to its members fossil fuel carbon emissions could cause ‘marked changes in climate’ by the year 2000.

AI surveillance: Reclaiming privacy through informational control,2024,"With the rise of algorithmic management, the deployment of AI surveillance has proliferated in the modern workplace. AI surveillance relies on advanced computational methods to draw statistical inferences about workers from their data. These inferences are subsequently used by employers to inform various organisational and managerial decisions. This commodifies workers into statistical entities, which objectifies and instrumentalises the value of human work as a series of data points for algorithmic analysis. The article explores how this transformation impacts the precarious role of privacy in the employment context, which already navigates the inherent informational imbalances that arise from the structural subordination of workers to employers and are further exasperated by AI surveillance. It focuses on the remedies of EU law that instantiate specific notions of informational control as a core ingredient to privacy and data protection. This involves consideration of the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as the jurisprudence of Articles 7 and 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The article argues that a greater emphasis on workers’ informational control consolidates existing privacy protections and mitigates the systemic risks of data-driven commodification.","['surveillance:', 'reclaiming', 'privacy', 'through', 'informational', 'control']"
Digital Inclusion and Systemic Barriers: The Role of Technology in Shaping the Participation of Women of Color in Hybrid Workspaces,2025,"The rise of hybrid and remote work models, facilitated by digital technologies, has been widely regarded as a means of enhancing workforce diversity and inclusion. However, this study critically examines how these digital workplaces simultaneously reinforce systemic inequalities, particularly for women of color. Drawing on digital divide theory and intersectionality theory, this research explores the ways in which women of color navigate technological barriers, algorithmic bias, and workplace surveillance while developing adaptive strategies to assert their authority in digital spaces. Through a qualitative, interpretivist approach, the study conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 women of color working in hybrid and remote professional settings across multiple industries. Thematic analysis revealed three overarching themes: (1) inclusion and participation in digital workspaces, (2) barriers to digital equity and systemic exclusion, and (3) strategies for overcoming digital workplace challenges. Findings highlight how digital platforms provide greater access to professional spaces but do not inherently disrupt social hierarchies. Women of color frequently encounter muted authority in virtual meetings, exclusion from leadership pipelines due to algorithmic hiring bias, and intensified workplace surveillance. Despite these challenges, participants employ strategic digital presence, self-advocacy, and peer-driven support networks to counteract exclusionary practices. This study contributes to the growing discourse on technological equity, advocating for bias audits in AI-driven recruitment, institutional accountability in digital workplaces, and the development of inclusive virtual work policies. By addressing these structural barriers, organizations can foster truly inclusive digital work environments that empower all employees, regardless of race or gender.","['digital', 'inclusion', 'systemic', 'barriers:', 'role', 'technology', 'shaping', 'participation', 'women', 'color', 'hybrid', 'workspaces']"

"The Metaverse, 2030: A Boring Virtual Future Averted by Inspired Entrepreneurs and Artists",2023,"Metaverse, Metahype, Metafun—maybe all three, or even none? As of 2023, there were three billion gamers in the world. Among these, the gaming platform Roblox had nearly 55 million average daily users. Some gamers wanted to help solve real-world challenges, and a game developer could become a well-known futurist by addressing challenges with a global impact. However, instead of focusing on the whole picture, these initiatives concentrated on existential risks and remained “boringly” focused on climate change, financial crises, and other issues.Then, when Facebook rebranded as part of Meta Platforms, Inc., in October 2021, it made clear that we would henceforth need to live with the “metaverse.” Stemming from Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash, in which the Metaverse was an urban virtual environment with avatars as inhabitants, it was praised as the successor to the Internet. Like an overarching architectural concept with a network of subsystems (or subverses), the Metaverse (Fig. 1) was implemented on several competing or coexisting private/business platforms.The XR (mixed reality) Metaverse community, combining virtual reality and augmented reality, involved fascinating people and was leading to collective intelligence, triggering the collective imagination. Millions of users entered a virtual world for playing, employment, and relationship-making: The online world was a “reality.”Seven years ago, in 2023, nobody really knew what the Metaverse would be like. Some said that the Metaverse was the next step toward an immersive experience of the Internet. The gaming sector was already larger than the movie and music sector, with more than three billion users. Web3 espoused decentralization and interoperability, and a full version of the Metaverse was developed to encompass daily activities such as socializing, commerce, fitness, and learning. Naturally the online existence reduced physically shared experiences, and public space lost some of its functions.The offline world was almost entirely based on local life, with trash and waste banned forever. A global monetary dislocation occurred, and intellectual property rights died by themselves. Space cooperation proved to be a new model, and a new logic of competition spread throughout various ecosystems. Self-management gained even more importance, and work/life balance became part of general well-being. People did not travel as much, simply because the virtual world had become a complement to real life, with the creation of entire new virtual cities.Whereas the modern Metaverse concept was first promoted in the United States and Europe, it rapidly received global hype. Centuries ago, Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi had dreamt he was a butterfly … or a butterfly dreamt he was Zhuangzi. Digital development patterns in Asia focused in particular on applications, whereas the Americas and Europe targeted the infrastructure level.Artists became creative explorers for the future Metaverse, which also challenged some features of humans as multisensorial interbeings. The neurons in our brain, as well as cells throughout the body, were able to integrate additional representations of digital worlds alongside our physical world. Space and time shrank through various beta concepts of teleportation. Over the years, incorporated hybrid functioning became part of human existence.Mark Zuckerberg was not our style of hero, which rather favors communities of inspired businesspeople and artists—even if he claimed that his Metaverse was about “helping people experience a much stronger sense of presence with the people they care about, the people they work with, and the places they want to be.” Right at that point, we said goodbye to the Facebook/Meta monoculture and engaged in a new way of looking at life, business, and Metaverse(s!).Imagine that the Metaverse became something other than an extension of American and Chinese mass market cultures, connecting physical and virtual worlds to create new spaces for overlapping private and business contexts. What if the Metaverse contributed something to us as biological humans, sometimes out of contemplation or boredom?Or suppose the Metaverse accelerated the ongoing shift from static individualism toward dynamic communitarianism, as a new version of tribal culture—interweaving culture, environment, and wellness. Could this have led to the proliferation of communities following fractal patterns, some of them crystallizing at a higher level of consciousness? Imagine conversations hosted by avatar communities of practice having a critical impact on what was happening in the world. What if these conversations contributed toward shifting our global energy and consciousness from simply searching on the Internet to deep immersive presence and relationships (Fig. 2)?Or imagine that the immersive, experienceable character of the Metaverse had a critical impact on education, and on the health and environment sectors; that digital technologies, and in particular AI, modified our connection to the nonhuman world and helped us in changing our auto-centric and patriarchal worldview.Suppose that such experiences helped us to rethink our relations to other humans, other beings, and matter beyond reflexivity. The Metaverse then did not narrow our perceptions and self-reflexivity. Could you have imagined that the world of poiesis as creative self-realization opened to us the world of our feelings, our social bonds, and everything that we meaningfully experience as a path from Enlightenment toward “Enlivenment”?What if a new school of philosophical thought appeared, linked to the emergence of human digital twins? Or a spectrum of collective fears of “no-community” spaces created by the big platforms in a context where nation-states were losing their substance? If these no-rules spaces were rather cocreated by on-the-ground, innumerable, fractal initiatives in a fragmented world?Most of us did not want the Metaverse to become a world, parallel to the “real” world, going backward toward social isolation and weakening ethical or ontological agency. We were able to cope with increasing political and ontological fakery, surveillance, and politically influenced capitalism. Scattered attention, mindless browsing, and states of disembodiment—perceiving others in “bits and pieces”—as induced by many digital environments, were not an inescapable destiny.Enlightened entrepreneurs, who were totally different from the big platform thinkers, were the architects of the Metaverse. They developed effective antennas in a fragmented world in which big companies started to scale down. They took the Metaverse paradigm as an opportunity to update the concept of strategic industries and self-sufficiency. Beyond a pure data economy perspective, business ideas were linked to creative commons and communities of practice rather than maximization of profit.The concept of “warm data”—contextual and relational information about complex systems—complemented “cold data” linked to a purely linear approach. Employee well-being, education, and engaging “brains instead of brawn” became the new workplace imperative, and a substantial value of Metaverse applications lay in the entrepreneurial context.Uniqueness of people and place became a key factor for interrelating with the Metaverse—community by community, bioregion by bioregion. Fluid entrepreneurs became interconnected, reenacting the concept of digital tribes and pan-connected nomadism, building on self-management and empathy. Regeneration flourished and even sidelined sustainability.Beyond the mania for XR headsets, 6G, quantum connectivity, and virtual assets/digital wallets, the new Metaverse business approach included the orchestration of various ecosystems, including the workforce, functioning in a fluid, organic (biological), unpredictable way, with humans no longer viewed as consumers but responsible and committed citizens forming part of complex societies’ experience between offline and online worlds, as the future was mixed reality.The Metaverse happened at the intersection of five fields of activity and technology, where fluid entrepreneurs became active and demonstrated their ability to: provide a well-designed interface and user experience between offline and online worlds for a mixed reality futurefulfill the expectation of hundreds of millions of active users to share and receive an emotional and empathic delivery of content and servicesbe resourceful in light of environmental challenges requiring that, even given fusion and solar energies, power consumption for Web3/virtual assets be considered seriouslyprovide a multisensory experience for humans in the context of a hybrid competition at the physical-digital intersectionconsider the worldwide population of billions of people in addition to other nonhuman lifeforms such as robots, animals, and plants.Artists were the other architects of the Metaverse, even though, for years, leaders had remained unaware of how artists were key in making sense of the unfolding future, not only in terms of coming up with meaningful proposals but also in avoiding tasteless ones such as pointless VR landscapes, kitschy animations, or questionable games. Whereas in the real world, creation was impacted by many constraints such as physical conditions or regulation by governments, the Metaverse appeared as a space or realm with infinite configurations.Artists triggered conversations on what was to be done, thus shaping what it is possible to do. They did the job firsthand in an experimental approach, as, over the past twenty centuries, they had been the creators of rich aesthetic worlds almost everywhere on the Planet. They created verses, poems, and novels, and made beautiful proposals about bodies and humans moving and dancing in space. Their imagination was connected to a “meta-world,” drawing inspiration from the invisible or untouchable. Artists also helped end a growing disconnection with nature, a diminished use of the senses, and higher rates of emotional and physical illness.While the Metaverse offered new opportunities for creators and users to engage and experience, Web3 heralded a new, decentralized ecosystem including all kinds of block-chains, in which users began to own, monetize, and utilize their data for their own benefit, and creators could monetize their content and talents in different ways.In addition, artists introduced a decision filter for companies’ involvement in the Metaverse to augment and elevate human experience to: build a people-first experience, always considering the needs of people; and to shift from social to societal, emphasizing relationships between people, places, and brandsensure people are not disconnected from physical realitymake accessibility and inclusivity a feature, andreduce physical and mental friction to ensure we engage with each other in a more human way across worlds.Artists promoted safe spaces and intuitive worldviews rather than a modernist (aka logical and rational) one. They pushed toward organic patterns and acceptance of transience and imperfection.In the Metaverse, artists expanded the sense of possibility, making us see that what is not there matters as much as what is there. They helped us in looking at organic design, inviting us into the blurred areas of the unknown. We started to become comfortable with ambiguity, and beauty became a dynamic, perfectly imperfect event occurring between us and other beings and things.Far removed from ancient Greece, where metaphysics was commonly understood as the science of what is beyond the physical, meta was later extended to other contexts as an understanding of beyond. Later still, when artists and fluid entrepreneurs stepped in, the Metaverse started to allow free movement between virtual and physical worlds, expanding our range of experiences.We were good at finding our way in complex and messy worlds. “Virtuality” had become a “reality,” and new time horizons had extended our appreciation of existence. In the end, the Metaverse had much to do with harnessing the necessary wisdom and spirituality to find our way in our complex world. We just needed to package it in a way that connected us with all.","['metaverse,', '2030:', 'boring', 'virtual', 'future', 'averted', 'inspired', 'entrepreneurs', 'artists']"
Innovative technologies for enhancing occupational safety in construction sites,2024,"The construction industry faces persistent challenges in ensuring occupational safety due to its high-risk environment and dynamic work conditions. Adopting innovative technologies has emerged as a transformative approach to addressing these challenges and improving worker safety. Wearable devices, drones, and smart sensors have been at the forefront of this shift, enabling real-time hazard detection, monitoring worker health, and enhancing safety protocols through advanced training methodologies. This article explores the role of these technologies in revolutionizing occupational safety in construction sites. Wearable devices, such as smart helmets and vests, monitor physiological parameters and environmental conditions, providing early warnings for potential hazards. Drones offer aerial surveillance capabilities, enabling site managers to identify unsafe conditions and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Smart sensors embedded in machinery and site infrastructure provide continuous data for monitoring equipment health and detecting environmental risks such as gas leaks or structural instabilities. The article also examines case studies of successful implementations, demonstrating how these technologies have reduced workplace incidents, enhanced productivity, and fostered a culture of safety. Challenges in adoption, including cost implications, integration with existing systems, and workforce training, are discussed, along with strategies to overcome them. By integrating innovative technologies, the construction industry can create safer and more efficient work environments, ultimately minimizing risks and enhancing occupational health. The study concludes by exploring emerging trends, such as AI-powered predictive analytics and robotic automation, which promise to further advance safety practices in construction.","['innovative', 'technologies', 'enhancing', 'occupational', 'safety', 'construction', 'sites']"
SPL27 DIGITALIZATION IN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAMMES: THE NEW CHALLENGES,2024,"Abstract Since technology became integrated into human life, rapid changes have occurred across nearly all aspects of human existence, including economics, social dynamics, and culture. Humans are required to adapt to and embrace these changes. Many manual jobs have been replaced by technology through automation. AI technology has swiftly provided humans with convenience in their daily lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled individuals to become more adept with technology in order to maintain connectivity from isolated locations through the use of technology. Occupational health is not immune to the challenges of these changes. Discoveries in digital methodologies for Risk Assessment, Fitness to Work program, and Occupational Health Surveillance processes, as well as supporting tools for diagnosing work-related illnesses, and even mental health programs, have significantly influenced the field of occupational health. All of these developments are made to facilitate human work without deviating from the goal of Occupational Health programs, which is to create a work environment and maintain worker health to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses. The human role remains crucial to ensure the accuracy and validity of every analysis conducted digitally through the technology created. If we look at the number of work-related diseases issued by the ILO as well as data on deaths caused by NCDs, our task as OH practitioners is certainly to prevent a significant increase in these figures. So, what is the progress of digital innovation in the field of occupational health? Upon deeper examination, technological advancements in the field of industrial hygiene have progressed rapidly in conducting health risk assessments to measure and control hazards. For example, in the case of physical hazards, gas detectors, which were previously manually operated, can now be integrated into workers' equipment with the aim of providing early warnings to personnel regarding potentially dangerous situations such as flammable or toxic atmospheres (gas) or fires, as well as heat monitoring, by placing numerous sensors at points where workers perform hot work. This ensures protection against heat-related diseases. Technological advancements in PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) represent significant progress in making workers more comfortable while still protecting them from health hazards. In conducting Fit to Work assessments, digitalization and technologies such as Heart Rate Variability, Fit to Work assessment, 3D radiographer reader, and telemedicine can perform real-time screening, which is useful for early detection of diseases that may be caused by health hazard in the workplace, including Stress monitoring and NCD monitoring. The role of the Occupational Health Doctor in addressing these challenges lies in combining competencies and skills in occupational health programs with this digitalization to achieve the goal of creating productive workers. Several challenges in implementing digitalization, especially regarding generation gaps, can be overcome through cross-generational collaboration and continuous knowledge transfer. Legal aspects, government support, leadership commitment, and resource competencies remain key to the successful implementation of this digitalization. Digitalization should serve as enablers for the swift and accurate screening and early detection of health issues in the workplace.","['spl27', 'digitalization', 'occupational', 'health', 'programmes:', 'challenges']"
"Electronic Performance Monitoring in the Digital Workplace: Conceptualization, Review of Effects and Moderators, and Future Research Opportunities",2021,"The rise of digital and interconnected technology within the workplace, including programs that facilitate monitoring and surveillance of employees is unstoppable. The COVID-19-induced lockdowns and the resulting increase in home office adoption even increased this trend. Apart from major benefits that may come along with such information and communication technologies (e.g., productivity increases, better resource planning, and increased worker safety), they also enable comprehensive Electronic Performance Monitoring (EPM) which may also have negative effects (e.g., increased stress and a reduction in job satisfaction). This conceptual article investigates EPM to better understand the development, adoption, and impact of EPM systems in organizations. The EPM literature published since the 1980s constitutes the basis for this conceptual article. We present a framework which is intended to serve as foundation for future studies. Moreover, we reviewed more than three decades of empirical EPM research and identified six major outcomes that are influenced by the use of an EPM system, as well as a large number of moderator variables. Based on our conceptual analyses and the resulting insights, which also include privacy, ethical, and cultural considerations, we discuss future research opportunities where we also refer to design implications for EPM systems.","['electronic', 'performance', 'monitoring', 'digital', 'workplace:', 'conceptualization,', 'review', 'effects', 'moderators,', 'future', 'research', 'opportunities']"
"0410 Impact of Digital Monitoring, Assessment, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Subjective Sleep Quality, Workplace Productivity and Health Related Quality of Life",2018,"The ubiquitous smartphone technology and societal pressures of constant connection have increased at an accelerated pace during the past decade, resulting in an always-on society. All too often, this has led to the belief that sleep is a dispensable luxury. The price is huge, as sleep deficiencies of many kinds have reached the level of a pandemic, affecting health, mood, life expectancy, and performance. However, we can use technology to undo the damages caused by technology itself. To test the above, Aetna initiated a randomized controlled trial to validate the efficacy of a mobile CBTI solution for improving sleep quality, workplace productivity, and quality of life in a commercial business population. 500 employees were recruited and surveyed for Insomnia using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Workplace Productivity and Impairment (WPAI), and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). Participants were stratified to sleep scores and randomly assigned to intervention/waiting list groups. The intervention consisted of a mobile application (SleepRate) and digital assessment for Insomnia based on both subjective and measured sleep data over seven nights, followed by weekly cycles of personalized, adaptive digital guidance relying on accepted protocols of CBTI. A second survey was administered at week 6, and the final survey at week 12. Of the 250 who received the application, 183 completed a baseline sleep assessment, and 83 completed 3 weeks of digital therapy with an weekly average of 5 tracked nights. At the end of 12 weeks, PSQI scores were 68% lower compared to the control group (P = 0.00), improving 4.8 points from baseline. Workplace presenteeism was 49.4% lower than for the control (P=0.00), and the HRQOL indicated 4.8 Healthy Days (P=0.00) per month were added to application users. Daytime sleepiness and sleep satisfaction also improved significantly. The availability of digital health technology allows people to diminish their sleep deficiencies in the comfort of their own home, leading to greater workplace productivity and quality of life.

Improving Employee Well-Being and Effectiveness: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Web-Based Psychological Interventions Delivered in the Workplace,2017,"Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety among working populations can result in reduced work performance and increased absenteeism. Although there is evidence that these common mental health problems are preventable and treatable in the workplace, uptake of psychological treatments among the working population is low. One way to address this may be the delivery of occupational digital mental health interventions. While there is convincing evidence for delivering digital psychological interventions within a health and community context, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis of these interventions in an occupational setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of occupational digital mental health interventions in enhancing employee psychological well-being and increasing work effectiveness and to identify intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Cochrane guidelines. Papers published from January 2000 to May 2016 were searched in the PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases, as well as the databases of the researchers and relevant websites. Unpublished data was sought using the Conference Proceedings Citation Index and the Clinical Trials and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) research registers. A meta-analysis was conducted by applying a random-effects model to assess the pooled effect size for psychological well-being and the work effectiveness outcomes. A positive deviance approach was used to identify those intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. Results: In total, 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the search criteria. Occupational digital mental health interventions had a statistically significant effect post intervention on both psychological well-being (g=0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.50) and work effectiveness (g=0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41) compared with the control condition. No statistically significant differences were found on either outcome between studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches (as defined by the authors) compared with other psychological approaches, offering guidance compared with self-guidance, or recruiting from a targeted workplace population compared with a universal workplace population. In-depth analysis of the interventions identified by the positive deviance approach suggests that interventions that offer guidance are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users (ie, emails and text messages [short message service, SMS]), and use elements of persuasive technology (ie, self-monitoring and tailoring), which may achieve greater engagement and adherence. Conclusions: This review provides evidence that occupational digital mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological well-being and increase work effectiveness. It identifies intervention characteristics that may increase engagement. Recommendations are made for future research, practice, and intervention development.","['improving', 'employee', 'well-being', 'effectiveness:', 'systematic', 'review', 'meta-analysis', 'web-based', 'psychological', 'interventions', 'delivered', 'workplace']"
"Binge drinking: Health impact, prevalence, correlates and interventions",2017,"Binge drinking (also called heavy episodic drinking, risky single-occasion drinking etc.) is a major public health problem. This paper provides an overview of recently published evidence concerning the definition and measurement, prevalence rates, health impact, demographic and psychosocial correlates of, and interventions for, binge drinking.Narrative review.Mostly occurring among young people at weekends, binge drinking increases the risk of both acute (e.g. injuries) and long-term negative consequences (e.g. alcohol disorders). Binge drinkers tend to be extrovert, impulsive and sensation-seeking. Stress, anxiety, traumatic events and depression are also related to binge drinking. Both alcohol-related behaviour of parents and general parenting (e.g. parenting styles, monitoring) are also important. Other major risk factors for binge drinking are frequently spending time with friends who drink, and the drinking norms observed in the wider social environment (e.g. school, community, culture). Emergency departments, birthday parties, fraternities and the workplace serve as settings for interventions; these are increasingly delivered via digital and mobile technology. There is evidence of small-sized effects across approaches (brief interventions, personalised normative feedback, protective behavioural strategies etc.) and populations.A more consistent terminology, investigating multi-level influences and identifying the most effective intervention components are challenges for future research.","['binge', 'drinking:', 'health', 'impact,', 'prevalence,', 'correlates', 'interventions']"
Digital health and the biopolitics of the Quantified Self,2017,"Recent years have witnessed an intensive growth of systems of measurement and an increasing integration of data processes into various spheres of everyday life. From smartphone apps that measure our activity and sleep, to digital devices that monitor our health and performance at the workplace, the culture of measurement is currently on the rise. Encouraged by movements such as the Quantified Self, whose motto is ‘self knowledge through numbers’, a growing number of people across the globe are embracing practices of self-quantification and tracking in the spirit of improving their wellbeing and productivity or charting their fitness progress. In this article, I examine the biopolitical aspects of the Quantified Self practices, exploring some of the ideologies and rationalities underlying self-tracking culture. I argue that such practices represent an instantiation of a ‘biopolitics of the self’ whereby the body is made amenable to management and monitoring techniques that often echo the ethos of neoliberalism. Rather than being restricted to an individualized form, self-tracking practices are also becoming part of a biosocial and communal phenomenon in which individuals are incited to share with others information about their physical activities and biodata. In exploring some examples of this data sharing culture, I critically address the extent to which the sharing of personal physical data can be seen as a ‘solidaristic’ act that can contribute to a larger Big Data ecosystem and inform the wider medical community and healthcare research and policy. I link this discussion to debates on ‘data philanthropy’, highlighting the emerging tension between philanthropic discourses of data sharing and issues of privacy. From here, I go on to discuss further ethical and political concerns, particularly in relation to data security and the marked shifts in healthcare responsibilities.","['digital', 'health', 'biopolitics', 'quantified', 'self']"
Tapping into the wearable device revolution in the work environment: a systematic review,2018,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to expand current knowledge about the recent trend of wearable technology to assess both its potential in the work environment and the challenges concerning the utilisation of wearables in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach After establishing exclusion and inclusion criteria, an independent systematic search of the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases for relevant studies was performed. Out of a total of 359 articles, 34 met the selection criteria. Findings This review identifies 23 categories of wearable devices. Further categorisation of the devices based on their utilisation shows they can be used in the work environment for activities including monitoring, augmenting, assisting, delivering and tracking. The review reveals that wearable technology has the potential to increase work efficiency among employees, improve workers’ physical well-being and reduce work-related injuries. However, the review also reveals that technological, social, policy and economic challenges related to the use of wearable devices remain. Research limitations/implications Many studies have investigated the benefits of wearable devices for personal use, but information about the use of wearables in the work environment is limited. Further research is required in the fields of technology, social challenges, organisation strategies, policies and economics to enhance the adoption rate of wearable devices in work environments. Originality/value Previous studies indicate that occupational stress and injuries are detrimental to employees’ health; this paper analyses the use of wearable devices as an intervention method to monitor or prevent these problems. Introducing a categorisation framework during implementation may help identify which types of device categories are suitable and could be beneficial for specific utilisation purposes, facilitating the adoption of wearable devices in the workplace.","['tapping', 'into', 'wearable', 'device', 'revolution', 'work', 'environment:', 'systematic', 'review']"
Controlling Working Crowds: The Impact of Digitalization on Worker Autonomy and Monitoring Across Hierarchical Levels,2019,"Abstract This study investigates the impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) on worker autonomy and monitoring using the second wave of the German Linked Personnel Panel, a linked employer-employee data set. From a theoretical point of view, the impact of ICT on workplace organization is ambiguous. On the one hand, the fast diffusion of ICT among employees makes it possible to monitor professional activities, leading to greater centralization. On the other hand, ICT enable employees to work more autonomously, so that workplace organization becomes more decentralized. Based on ordinary least squares and instrumental variable estimates, we find that ICT promotes both centralization and decentralization tendencies. Furthermore, managerial employees are more affected by ICT-induced monitoring and autonomy than their non-managerial counterparts. Finally, the effect of digital ICT on employee autonomy is more pronounced than the corresponding effect on employee monitoring. Again, this does especially hold for managerial employees. All in all, our results support the view that unlike prior technological revolutions digitalization primarily affects the employment prospects and working conditions of employees at medium and higher hierarchical levels.","['controlling', 'working', 'crowds:', 'impact', 'digitalization', 'worker', 'autonomy', 'monitoring', 'across', 'hierarchical', 'levels']"
"Nutrition knowledge, diet quality and hypertension in a working population",2015,"To examine if employees with higher nutrition knowledge have better diet quality and lower prevalence of hypertension. Cross-sectional baseline data were obtained from the complex workplace dietary intervention trial, the Food Choice at Work Study. Participants included 828 randomly selected employees (18–64 years) recruited from four multinational manufacturing workplaces in Ireland, 2013. A validated questionnaire assessed nutrition knowledge. Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) measured diet quality from which a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) score was constructed. Standardised digital blood pressure monitors measured hypertension. Nutrition knowledge was positively associated with diet quality after adjustment for age, gender, health status, lifestyle and socio-demographic characteristics. The odds of having a high DASH score (better diet quality) were 6 times higher in the highest nutrition knowledge group compared to the lowest group (OR = 5.8, 95% CI 3.5 to 9.6). Employees in the highest nutrition knowledge group were 60% less likely to be hypertensive compared to the lowest group (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.87). However, multivariate analyses were not consistent with a mediation effect of the DASH score on the association between nutrition knowledge and blood pressure. Higher nutrition knowledge is associated with better diet quality and lower blood pressure but the inter-relationships between these variables are complex.","['nutrition', 'knowledge,', 'diet', 'quality', 'hypertension', 'working', 'population']"
"Electronic Performance Monitoring in the Digital Workplace: Conceptualization, Review of Effects and Moderators, and Future Research Opportunities",2021,"The rise of digital and interconnected technology within the workplace, including programs that facilitate monitoring and surveillance of employees is unstoppable. The COVID-19-induced lockdowns and the resulting increase in home office adoption even increased this trend. Apart from major benefits that may come along with such information and communication technologies (e.g., productivity increases, better resource planning, and increased worker safety), they also enable comprehensive Electronic Performance Monitoring (EPM) which may also have negative effects (e.g., increased stress and a reduction in job satisfaction). This conceptual article investigates EPM to better understand the development, adoption, and impact of EPM systems in organizations. The EPM literature published since the 1980s constitutes the basis for this conceptual article. We present a framework which is intended to serve as foundation for future studies. Moreover, we reviewed more than three decades of empirical EPM research and identified six major outcomes that are influenced by the use of an EPM system, as well as a large number of moderator variables. Based on our conceptual analyses and the resulting insights, which also include privacy, ethical, and cultural considerations, we discuss future research opportunities where we also refer to design implications for EPM systems.","['electronic', 'performance', 'monitoring', 'digital', 'workplace:', 'conceptualization,', 'review', 'effects', 'moderators,', 'future', 'research', 'opportunities']"
Dataveillance in the Workplace: Managing the Impact of Innovation,2020,"Abstract Background: Monitoring and surveillance are a fundamental part of the workplace environment, with employee performance and productivity as the main objects of scrutiny. However, many questions surround the ethical nature of managements’ ability to employ advanced digital technologies to monitor employee behaviour and performance while in the workplace. If unaddressed, these concerns have the potential to significantly impact the relationship between the employee and the employer, impacting trust in management resulting in negative attitudes and counterproductive behaviours. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of workplace surveillance whilst outlining some of the emerging issues relating to the use of employee monitoring technologies in the workplace. Methods/Approach: A detailed review of the literature was conducted in order to identify the major issues relating to workplace surveillance. In addition, a number of practitioner-based studies were examined to extract and identify emerging trends and concerns at an industry level. Results: Workplace surveillance is on the rise; however, empirical studies are in short supply. Conclusions: The issue of workplace surveillance is an under-researched area, which requires much attention. There is a distinct need for clear measures and structures that govern the effective and fair use of communication technologies in the workplace.","['dataveillance', 'workplace:', 'managing', 'impact', 'innovation']"
Older Workers in Digitalizing Workplaces: A Systematic Literature Review,2022,"AbstractWorkplace digitalization created a sea change in work practices and it altered the situation of older workers. Digitalization entails the increased use of digital technologies, such as computers and online services. Older workers often possess limited digital skills, which may put their labor market participation at risk. Previous studies began exploring how older workers fare when their workplaces are digitalizing. However, the research field is still emerging and remains fragmented. This article comprises a systematic literature review that takes inventory of what we currently know about older workers in digitalizing workplaces. It demonstrates that older workers experience the digitalization of their workplaces in various areas, reaching from health monitoring to work arrangements. Interestingly, challenges and opportunities emerge in each area affected. This Janus-faced situation underlines the complexity of consequences, and it raises questions about social inequalities in these consequences. The work environment plays a crucial role in shaping how older workers experience workplace digitalization. It shapes which options for adaptation they have, and to which degree they can act on these options. This circumstance makes workplaces an excellent starting point for interventions. Country-characteristics likewise exert an influence. While characteristics such as retirement regulations are purposefully modified for intervention, other characteristics, such as culture, are not. This circumstance limits governmental options for shaping the situation of older workers in digitalizing workplaces. Future research should further explore the situation of older workers in digitalizing workplaces, paying special attention to the theoretical framework and to developments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['older', 'workers', 'digitalizing', 'workplaces:', 'systematic', 'literature', 'review']"
From forced Working-From-Home to voluntary working-from-anywhere: Two revolutions in telework,2022,"The COVID-19 outbreak has admittedly caused interruptions to production, transportation, and mobility, therefore, having a significant impact on the global supply and demand chain's well-functioning. But what happened to companies developing digital services, such as software? How has the enforced Working-From-Home (WFH) mode impacted their ability to deliver software, if at all? This article shares our findings from monitoring the WFH during 2020 in an international software company with engineers located in Sweden, the USA, and the UK. We analyzed different aspects of productivity, such as developer job satisfaction and well-being, activity, communication and collaboration, efficiency and flow based on the archives of commit data, calendar invites, Slack communication, the internal reports of WFH experiences, and 30 interviews carried out in April/May and September 2020. We add more objective evidence to the existing COVID-19 studies the vast majority of which are based on self-reported productivity from the early months of the pandemic. We find that engineers continue committing code and carrying out their daily duties, as their routines adjust to ""the new norm"". Our key message is that software engineers can work from home and quickly adjust their tactical approaches to the changes of unprecedented scale. Further, WFH has its benefits, including better work-life balance, improved flow, and improved quality of distributed meetings and events. Yet, WFH is not challenge free: not everybody feels equally productive working from home, work hours for many increased, while physical activity, socialization, pairing and opportunities to connect to unfamiliar colleagues decreased. Information sharing and meeting patterns also changed. Finally, experiences gained during the pandemic will have a lasting impact on the future of the workplace. The results of an internal company-wide survey suggest that only 9% of engineers will return to work in the office full time. Our article concludes with the InterSoft's strategy for work from anywhere (WFX), and a list of useful adjustments for a better WFH.","['forced', 'working-from-home', 'voluntary', 'working-from-anywhere:', 'revolutions', 'telework']"
Effectiveness of Behaviorally Designed Gamification Interventions With Social Incentives for Increasing Physical Activity Among Overweight and Obese Adults Across the United States,2019,"<h3>Importance</h3> Gamification, the use of game design elements in nongame contexts, is increasingly being used in workplace wellness programs and digital health applications. However, the best way to design social incentives in gamification interventions has not been well examined. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess the effectiveness of support, collaboration, and competition within a behaviorally designed gamification intervention to increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This 36-week randomized clinical trial with a 24-week intervention and 12-week follow-up assessed 602 adults from 40 states with body mass indexes (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 25 or higher from February 12, 2018, to March 17, 2019. <h3>Interventions</h3> Participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, were randomly assigned to a control (n = 151) or to 1 of 3 gamification interventions (support [n = 151], collaboration [n = 150], and competition [n = 150]), and were remotely monitored. The control group received feedback from the wearable device but no other interventions for 36 weeks. The gamification arms were entered into a 24-week game designed using insights from behavioral economics with points and levels for achieving step goals. No gamification interventions occurred during follow-up. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 24-week intervention period. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 602 participants (mean [SD] age, 39 [10] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 30 [5]; 427 [70.9%] male) were included in the study. Compared with controls, participants had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during the intervention in the competition arm (adjusted difference, 920; 95% CI, 513-1328;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), support arm (adjusted difference, 689; 95% CI, 267-977;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and collaboration arm (adjusted difference, 637; 95% CI, 258-1017;<i>P</i> = .001). During follow-up, physical activity remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm (adjusted difference, 569; 95% CI, 142-996;<i>P</i> = .009) but was not significantly greater in the support (adjusted difference, 428; 95% CI, 19-837;<i>P</i> = .04) and collaboration (adjusted difference, 126; 95% CI, −248 to 468;<i>P</i> = .49) arms than in the control arm. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> All 3 gamification interventions significantly increased physical activity during the 24-week intervention, and competition was the most effective. Physical activity was lower in all arms during follow-up and only remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT03311230","['effectiveness', 'behaviorally', 'designed', 'gamification', 'interventions', 'social', 'incentives', 'increasing', 'physical', 'activity', 'among', 'overweight', 'obese', 'adults', 'across', 'united', 'states']"
The digitization of working life: Challenges and opportunities,2020,"In recent years, the role of technology in working life has increased.

How can the work environment be redesigned to enhance the well-being of individuals with autism?,2022,"Purpose This article examines the opportunities to create optimal conditions for individuals with autism, to work successfully within the contemporary workplace and improve their well-being. These opportunities arise from digital technology (DT) development, enabling the work environment to be remodeled by providing new possibilities and ways of working. The author discusses both technology-based as well as non-technological accommodations supporting overcoming the workplace challenges faced by employees with autism. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research was conducted with the use of in-depth interviews with 21 individuals with expertise in the field. Findings Possible technology-based work environment modifications and non-technological managerial practices facilitating work integration and the long-term well-being of individuals with autism were proposed. These solutions address four main problems: (1) effective communication; (2) time management, task prioritizing, and organization of work; (3) stress management and emotion control; and (4) sensory sensitivity. Practical implications Proposed solutions include primarily the wide usage of electronic mediated forms of communicating based on non-direct and non-verbal contact; a flexible approach towards work organization; accurate stress monitoring systems; and an individualized approach toward office space arrangements limiting external stimuli. Originality/value All this could lead not only to an increase in employment in individuals on the autism spectrum but also influence the improvement of the job performance of already employed. Modifications introduced could improve the long-term well-being of all employees, both with autism and neurotypical ones.","['work', 'environment', 'redesigned', 'enhance', 'well-being', 'individuals', 'autism?']"
Welcome to the Machine: Privacy and Workplace Implications of Predictive Analytics,2015,"Predictive analytics use a method known as data mining to identify trends, patterns, or relationships among data, which can then be used to develop a predictive model. Data mining itself relies upon big data, which is “big” not solely because of its size but also because its analytical potential is qualitatively different. “Big data” analysis allows organizations, including government and businesses, to combine diverse digital datasets and then use statistics and other data mining techniques to extract from them both hidden information and surprising correlations. These data are not necessarily tracking transactional records of atomized behavior, such as the purchasing history of customers, but keeping track of communication dynamics and social interactions.Employers have long used various tools to monitor workers, whether to track productivity or guard against improper behavior in the workplace. But as individuals communicate and socialize more and more online, a whole new array of data is becoming available to employers to evaluate job candidates and monitor workers through predictive analytics. Current U.S. privacy law provides almost no protection from the type of “profile” that can be generated through predictive analytics, no matter how personal. It considers any information that is potentially publicly available to not be private — regardless of how that “public” information is collected and used. There is, however, one developing privacy theory that could potentially provide privacy protection from predictive analytics: the “mosaic” theory recognizes that continuous monitoring of publicly available information can reveal an intimate picture of an individual’s life.Predictive analytics have existed for some time, but have only recently “come of age” in employment situations. This article examines the use of predictive analytics in the workplace, threats to worker privacy arising from predictive analytics, and whether the mosaic theory offers a viable and needed method of privacy protection. This article concludes, however, that unless a new theory of privacy protection is adopted — and soon — everyone faces serious threats to their privacy.","['welcome', 'machine:', 'privacy', 'workplace', 'implications', 'predictive', 'analytics']"
Data Subjects' Perspectives on Emotion Artificial Intelligence Use in the Workplace: A Relational Ethics Lens,2023,"The workplace has experienced extensive digital transformation, in part due to artificial intelligence's commercial availability. Though still an emerging technology, emotional artificial intelligence (EAI) is increasingly incorporated into enterprise systems to augment and automate organizational decisions and to monitor and manage workers. EAI use is often celebrated for its potential to improve workers' wellbeing and performance as well as address organizational problems such as bias and safety. Workers subject to EAI in the workplace are data subjects whose data make EAI possible and who are most impacted by it. However, we lack empirical knowledge about data subjects' perspectives on EAI, including in the workplace. To this end, using a relational ethics lens, we qualitatively analyzed 395 U.S. adults' open-ended survey (partly representative) responses regarding the perceived benefits and risks they associate with being subjected to EAI in the workplace. While participants acknowledged potential benefits of being subject to EAI (e.g., employers using EAI to aid their wellbeing, enhance their work environment, reduce bias), a myriad of potential risks overshadowed perceptions of potential benefits. Participants expressed concerns regarding the potential for EAI use to harm their wellbeing, work environment and employment status, and create and amplify bias and stigma against them, especially the most marginalized (e.g., along dimensions of race, gender, mental health status, disability). Distrustful of EAI and its potential risks, participants anticipated conforming to (e.g., partaking in emotional labor) or refusing (e.g., quitting a job) EAI implementation in practice. We argue that EAI may magnify, rather than alleviate, existing challenges data subjects face in the workplace and suggest that some EAI-inflicted harms would persist even if concerns of EAI's accuracy and bias are addressed.","['data', ""subjects'"", 'perspectives', 'emotion', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'workplace:', 'relational', 'ethics', 'lens']"
Psychosocial epidemiology,2017,"In this introductory chapter of The Routledge International Handbook of Psychosocial Epidemiology, we describe the concepts and methods used in the study of psychosocial factors, health and disease, including study designs to obtain robust information and minimise bias. In addition, we discuss the various strategies as well as the challenges of translating evidence into population health improvement. As living standards have improved, absolute deprivation in the material sense (e.g. lacking food and shelter for survival) has receded, at least in high-income countries. Regulatory standards also protect populations from the threat of pollution, contaminated food, and workplace physical hazards. In western societies, risk and protective factors for health are therefore becoming increasingly psychosocial in nature rather than physical. It is within this milieu that psychosocial epidemiology, a discipline linking psychological, social and medical sciences, has flourished. Opportunities for such research are now better than ever before. Assessment of psychosocial factors, such as social relations, life stresses and mood, has become easier with the development of digital survey technology and improved availability of information on social environments, both of which can be linked to individual medical records. The advent of electronic health records and wearable devices provides researchers with a practical way to monitor a person's health over time and to identify those who are at risk of developing chronic conditions. We contend that psychosocial epidemiology is a growing scientific discipline, both in terms of discovery (i.e. as a study of disease causation and mechanisms) and delivery (as a study of cost-effective interventions).","['psychosocial', 'epidemiology']"
Employee Monitoring in the Digital Era: Managing the Impact of Innovation,2019,"The many obvious benefits that accompany digital technology have been matched by some less welcome and more contentious impacts. One of these is the steady erosion of privacy. For example monitoring and surveillance has become a fundamental part of the workplace environment, with employee performance often the main object of scrutiny. With companies now competing within a rapidly changing global economy, managers are forced to satisfy market trends that are driven by productivity and efficiency. Attempts to satisfy these imperatives have resulted in a relentless drive to improve performance and increase efficiency. In fact, the increasing number of organisations that monitor employees through advanced digital technologies has added a dystopian edge to existing employee privacy concerns, particularly as many employees are unable to exercise choice in relation to use of these technologies. If unaddressed, their concerns have potential to impact the psychological contract between employee and employer, resulting in loss of employee trust, negative attitudes and counterproductive work behaviours. This paper outlines some of the emerging issues relating to use of employee monitoring technologies. It summarises both management rationale for monitoring as well as employee privacy concerns in an effort to balance the perspectives of both parties.","['employee', 'monitoring', 'digital', 'era:', 'managing', 'impact', 'innovation']"
Immunotoxicity of nanomaterials in health and disease: Current challenges and emerging approaches for identifying immune modifiers in susceptible populations,2022,"Abstract Nanosafety assessment has experienced an intense era of research during the past decades driven by a vivid interest of regulators, industry, and society. Toxicological assays based on in vitro cellular models have undergone an evolution from experimentation using nanoparticulate systems on singular epithelial cell models to employing advanced complex models more realistically mimicking the respective body barriers for analyzing their capacity to alter the immune state of exposed individuals. During this phase, a number of lessons were learned. We have thus arrived at a state where the next chapters have to be opened, pursuing the following objectives: (1) to elucidate underlying mechanisms, (2) to address effects on vulnerable groups, (3) to test material mixtures, and (4) to use realistic doses on (5) sophisticated models. Moreover, data reproducibility has become a significant demand. In this context, we studied the emerging concept of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) from the perspective of immune activation and modulation resulting in pro‐inflammatory versus tolerogenic responses. When considering the interaction of nanomaterials with biological systems, protein corona formation represents the relevant molecular initiating event (e.g., by potential alterations of nanomaterial‐adsorbed proteins). Using this as an example, we illustrate how integrated experimental–computational workflows combining in vitro assays with in silico models aid in data enrichment and upon comprehensive ontology‐annotated (meta)data upload to online repositories assure FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability). Such digital twinning may, in future, assist in early‐stage decision‐making during therapeutic development, and hence, promote safe‐by‐design innovation in nanomedicine. Moreover, it may, in combination with in silico‐based exposure‐relevant dose‐finding, serve for risk monitoring in particularly loaded areas, for example, workplaces, taking into account pre‐existing health conditions.

Behavioral health workforce development challenges in the digital health era.,2017,"This column describes challenges for hiring, training, and supervising psychiatric rehabilitation service providers for positions that involve the use of digital health technology.Adoption and implementation of any new technology or technique requires workforce development. This article outlines considerations for policymakers, funders, and service agency administrators as digital health technologies become more widespread.The article discusses issues based on professional experience of the authors and available literature.The literature on adoption of innovations in general, and the adoption of psychiatric evidence-based practices in particular, indicates that funding and adoption of new techniques and technologies are not adequate to ensure full and sustained implementation. The use of any new treatment or technology requires training and other supports to ensure that users have the competencies needed to make it work and that the workplace supports its use. As new digital health technologies become available, considerations of their cost and effectiveness need to include an examination of the required competencies of the service providers who will use them and the added cost of developing, enhancing, and maintaining those competencies. Specific attitudes, knowledge, and skills will be relevant to hiring decisions. Relevant preservice and on-the-job training opportunities, technical assistance, and supervision will be needed. Implementation needs to be monitored, not assumed, and the rights of the people who use technology-supported services must be fully protected.

Designing Sousveillance Tools for Gig Workers,2024,"As independently-contracted employees, gig workers disproportionately suffer the consequences of workplace surveillance, which include increased pressures to work, breaches of privacy, and decreased digital autonomy. Despite the negative impacts of workplace surveillance, gig workers lack the tools, strategies, and workplace social support to protect themselves against these harms. Meanwhile, some critical theorists have proposed sousveillance as a potential means of countering such abuses of power, whereby those under surveillance monitor those in positions of authority (e.g., gig workers collect data about requesters/platforms). To understand the benefits of sousveillance systems in the gig economy, we conducted semi-structured interviews and led co-design activities with gig workers. We use ""care ethics"" as a guiding concept to understand our interview and co-design data, while also focusing on empathic sousveillance technology design recommendations. Through our study, we identify gig workers' attitudes towards and past experiences with sousveillance. We also uncover the type of sousveillance technologies imagined by workers, provide design recommendations, and finish by discussing how to create empowering, empathic spaces on gig platforms.","['designing', 'sousveillance', 'tools', 'workers']"
Workplace Well-Being in Industry 5.0: A Worker-Centered Systematic Review,2024,"The paradigm of Industry 5.0 pushes the transition from the traditional to a novel, smart, digital, and connected industry, where well-being is key to enhance productivity, optimize man–machine interaction and guarantee workers’ safety. This work aims to conduct a systematic review of current methodologies for monitoring and analyzing physical and cognitive ergonomics. Three research questions are addressed: (1) which technologies are used to assess the physical and cognitive well-being of workers in the workplace, (2) how the acquired data are processed, and (3) what purpose this well-being is evaluated for. This way, individual factors within the holistic assessment of worker well-being are highlighted, and information is provided synthetically. The analysis was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 statement guidelines. From the sixty-five articles collected, the most adopted (1) technological solutions, (2) parameters, and (3) data analysis and processing were identified. Wearable inertial measurement units and RGB-D cameras are the most prevalent devices used for physical monitoring; in the cognitive ergonomics, and cardiac activity is the most adopted physiological parameter. Furthermore, insights on practical issues and future developments are provided. Future research should focus on developing multi-modal systems that combine these aspects with particular emphasis on their practical application in real industrial settings.","['workplace', 'well-being', 'industry', '5.0:', 'worker-centered', 'systematic', 'review']"
Wearable Biosensors in the Workplace: Perceptions and Perspectives,2022,"Wearable body and brain sensors are permeating the consumer market and are increasingly being considered for workplace applications with the goal of promoting safety, productivity, health, and wellness. However, the monitoring of physiologic signals in real-time prompts concerns about benefit and risk, ownership of such digital data, data transfer privacy, and the discovery and disclosure of signals of possible health significance. Here we explore the perceptions and perspectives of employers and employees about key ethical considerations regarding the potential use of sensors in the workplace.We distributed a survey developed and refined based on key research questions and past literature to a wide range and size of industries in British Columbia, Canada. Both employers (potential Implementers) and employees (potential Users) were invited to participate.We received 344 survey responses. Most responses were from construction, healthcare, education, government, and utilities sectors. Across genders, industries, and workplace sizes, we found a convergence of opinions on perceived benefit and concern between potential Implementers and potential Users regarding the motivation to use biosensors in the workplace. Potential Implementers and Users also agreed on issues pertaining to safety, privacy, disclosure of findings of possible medical significance, risks, data ownership, data sharing, and transfer of data between workplaces. The greatest variability between potential Users and Implementers pertained to data ownership.Strong agreement in the perception of biosensor use in the workplace between potential Implementers and Users reflects shared interest, motivation, and responsibility for their use. The use of sensors is rapidly increasing, and transparency about key use factors-both practical and ethical-is essential to maintain the current and desirable level of solidarity.","['wearable', 'biosensors', 'workplace:', 'perceptions', 'perspectives']"
The development of ‘Make One Small Change’: an e-health intervention for the workplace developed using the Person-Based Approach,2019,"Background The application of digital health interventions is widespread and many employers are implementing employee e-health programs. Intended to enhance productivity by increasing wellbeing, workplace interventions often lack evidence of effectiveness and have low rates of retention. Use of the person-based approach (PBA) is one solution, which offers a systematic framework for developing effective digital health interventions. This paper describes the application of the PBA to the development of ‘Make one small change’ (Cigna MSC™), an online behaviour change system for lifestyle habits focused on resilience, movement, eating and sleep. Method and results The development of Cigna MSC™ took place over four stages with colleagues ( n = 79) across Cigna globally. Application of the PBA entailed using high amounts of qualitative data to inform development and a cyclical process of ‘listening, applying and delivering’ was adhered to throughout. Early stages involved review of current literature and the collection of feedback in relation to existing interventions. Combined, results revealed key intervention development issues that were then used to form guiding principles. Guiding principles ensured intervention objectives translated into relevant design features. The final stages of evaluation included testing images, text and content approaches. Feedback dictated that the intervention should be fun, easy to use and include milestones for self-monitoring. The resulting version was finalised and made ready to pilot so future analysis can be made in relation to real-world engagement and the embedded evaluative content can be used to provide evidence of intervention effectiveness. Conclusions Using the PBA, which was evolved specifically to improve development of digital interventions, resulted in a workplace intervention embedded with in-depth user input combined with evidenced-based theory. This paper illustrates how using a rigorous methodology can drive the creation of an effective digital health intervention that uniquely allows for refinement at each stage.","['development', '‘make', 'small', 'change’:', 'e-health', 'intervention', 'workplace', 'developed', 'person-based', 'approach']"
Controlling working crowds: The impact of digitalization on worker autonomy and monitoring across hierarchical levels,2018,"This study investigates the impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) on worker autonomy and monitoring using the second wave of the German Linked Personnel Panel, a linked employer-employee data set. From a theoretical point of view, the impact of ICT on workplace organization is ambigu- ous. On the one hand, the fast diffusion of ICT among employees makes it possible to monitor professional activities, leading to greater centralization. On the other hand, ICT enable employees to work more autonomously, so that workplace organization becomes more decentralized. Based on ordinary least squares and instrumental variable estimates, we find that ICT promotes both centralization and decentralization tendencies. Furthermore, managerial employees are more affected by ICT-induced monitoring and autonomy than their non-managerial counterparts. Finally, the effect of digital ICT on employee autonomy is more pronounced than the corresponding effect on employee monitoring. Again, this does especially hold for managerial employees. All in all, our results support the view that unlike prior technological revolutions digitalization primarily affects the employment prospects and working conditions of employees at medium and higher hierarchical levels.","['controlling', 'working', 'crowds:', 'impact', 'digitalization', 'worker', 'autonomy', 'monitoring', 'across', 'hierarchical', 'levels']"

Effects of a Tailored Brief Behavioral Therapy Application on Insomnia Severity and Social Disabilities Among Workers With Insomnia in Japan,2020,"<h3>Importance</h3> According to the stepped-care model, there is a medium to large effect size for using cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia that is delivered digitally, such as a smartphone application. However, it has been reported that studies using fully automated cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia applications without expert support have high dropout rates. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine the effects of using a fully automated and individually tailored brief behavior therapy for insomnia (BBTI) applications for 2 weeks on insomnia-related symptoms, social disabilities, and work productivity among workers with insomnia in Japan. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This intent-to-treat prospective parallel-group randomized clinical trial included participants 20 years or older with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores of 8 or higher. Participants were recruited via internet advertisements and workplace flyers and randomized to tailored BBTI, standard BBTI, self-monitoring with sleep diaries, or a waiting list control group. The study was conducted from September 21, 2017, to February 23, 2018. Data were analyzed from February 24, 2018, to February 22, 2019. <h3>Interventions</h3> A personalized BBTI and standard BBTI intervention, both of which included sleep scheduling, relaxation, sleep hygiene, and sleep diaries, administered via smartphone application. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Primary outcomes were insomnia severity, measured using the Japanese version of the Insomnia Severity Index, and social disabilities, measured using the Japanese version of the Sheehan Disability Scale. Secondary outcomes were dysfunctional beliefs, sleep reactivity, and work productivity. All measures were taken before and after the intervention and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 92 participants (mean [SD] age, 42.7 [11.5] years; 60 [65%] men) were randomized and included in analysis, with 24 participants assigned to tailored BBTI, 23 participants assigned to standard BBTI, 23 participants assigned to self-monitoring, and 22 participants assigned to the waiting list control group. At baseline, there were no significant differences among groups on any demographic characteristics or outcome measures. The results of the intent-to-treat analysis showed an interaction effect for all outcome measures. Compared with the waiting list control group, the BBTI interventions were more effective for reduction of insomnia severity (tailored BBTI: Hedges<i>g</i> = –1.64 [95% CI, –2.32 to –0.96];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; standard BBTI:<i>g</i> = –1.28 [95% CI, –1.93 to –0.63];<i>P</i> &lt; .001), social disabilities relating to social life (tailored BBTI:<i>g</i> = –1.33 [95% CI, –1.97 to –0.68];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; standard BBTI:<i>g</i> = –0.84 [95% CI, –1.46 to –0.22];<i>P</i> = .009), and dysfunctional beliefs (tailored BBTI:<i>g</i> = –1.17 [95% CI, –1.80 to –0.54];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; standard BBTI:<i>g</i> = –0.84 [95% CI, –1.46 to –0.23];<i>P</i> = .02) at the 3-month follow-up. Tailored BBTI quickly reduced insomnia severity (1-month follow-up:<i>g</i> = –0.85 [95% CI, –1.46 to –0.24]). Tailored BBTI was only more effective for improvement of work performance (<i>g</i> = –1.09 [95% CI, –1.71 to –0.46];<i>P</i> = .005), social disabilities related to family life (g = –0.89 [95% CI, –1.51 to –0.28];<i>P</i> = .005), and sleep reactivity (<i>g</i> = –1.09 [95% CI, –1.72 to –0.46];<i>P</i> = .007) compared with the waiting list control group at the 3-month follow-up. The tailored BBTI led to improved worker productivity compared with standard BBTI (g = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.55];<i>P</i> = .01) at the 3-month follow-up. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> These findings suggest that an application for individually tailored BBTI is an inexpensive and effective treatment for insomnia. In future research, it would be informative to investigate the reasons for dropout during the follow-up period. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier:UMIN000036572","['effects', 'tailored', 'brief', 'behavioral', 'therapy', 'application', 'insomnia', 'severity', 'social', 'disabilities', 'among', 'workers', 'insomnia', 'japan']"
Pulmonary hypofunction due to calcium carbonate nanomaterial exposure in occupational workers: a cross-sectional study,2018,"Calcium carbonate nanomaterials (nano-CaCO3) are widely used in both manufacturing and consumer products, but their potential health hazards remain unclear. The objective of this study was to survey workplace exposure levels and health effects of workers exposed to nano-CaCO3. Personal and area sampling, as well as real-time and dust monitoring, were performed to characterize mass exposure, particle size distribution, and particle number exposure. A total of 56 workers (28 exposed workers and 28 unexposed controls) were studied in a cross-sectional study. They completed physical examinations, spirometry, and digital radiography. The results showed that the gravimetric nano-CaCO3 concentration was 5.264 ± 6.987 mg/m3 (0.037–22.192 mg/m3) at the workplace, and 3.577 ± 2.065 mg/m3 (2.042–8.161 mg/m3) in the breathing zone of the exposed workers. The particle number concentrations ranged from 8193 to 39 621 particles/cm3 with a size range of 30–150 nm. The process of packing had the highest gravimetric and particle number concentrations. The particle number concentration positively correlated with gravimetric concentrations of nano-CaCO3. The levels of hemoglobin, creatine phosphokinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the nano-CaCO3 exposure group increased significantly, but the white blood cell count (WBC), Complement 3 (C3), total protein (TP), uric acid, and creatinine (CREA) all decreased significantly. The prevalence rate of pulmonary hypofunction was significantly higher (p = 0.037), and the levels of vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory flow 25% (FEF 25%), FEF 25–75% were negatively correlated with gravimetric concentrations of nano-CaCO3 (p < 0.05). Logistic analysis showed that nano-CaCO3 exposure level was associated with pulmonary hypofunction (p = 0.005). Meanwhile, a dose-effect relationship was found between the accumulated gravimetric concentrations of nano-CaCO3 and the prevalence rate of pulmonary hypofunction (p = 0.048). In conclusion, long-term and high-level nano-CaCO3 exposure can induce pulmonary hypofunction in workers. Thus, lung function examination is suggested for occupational populations with nano-CaCO3 exposure. Furthermore, future health protection efforts should focus on senior workers with accumulation effects of nano-CaCO3 exposure.","['pulmonary', 'hypofunction', 'calcium', 'carbonate', 'nanomaterial', 'exposure', 'occupational', 'workers:', 'cross-sectional', 'study']"
Professionalism in a digital and mobile world: A way forward for nursing,2019,"Professionalism in nursing has long been steeped in controversy. For many years some argued that nurses were only semi-professional due to a lack of university education and qualifications and a knowledge base and skillset that were not distinctly unique (Adams & Miller, 2001). Nurses are now an established profession with clear and robust educational frameworks, codes of professional conduct and standards of practice (Sills, 2000), regulated by an independent agency or governing body. Examples include the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) which have scope and standards for practice, along with ethical codes, that underpin nursing practice in these countries (American Nursing Association, 2010; American Nursing Association, 2015; Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, 2016). These outline the responsibilities and duties nurses have to patients and the public and include values such as caring, compassion and dignity and behaviours such as supporting, empowering and communicating with patients, relatives, colleagues and students. The International Council of Nurses also emphasise that comprehensive regulations are necessary to maintain trust in the nursing profession (International Council of Nurses, 2014). An emerging trend in the professional practice of nurses is that of digital professionalism, which has been defined as: ""the attitudes and behaviours (some of which may occur in private settings) reflecting traditional professionalism paradigms that are manifested through digital media"" (Cain & Romanelli, 2009, p. 67). Nurses have used health information systems such as electronic health records for many years to help manage the nursing care process and record data for regulatory, fiscal incentive and population monitoring purposes (Topaz et al., 2016). However, the rise of mobile technology has blurred the boundary between professional and private life as they enable digital information to be collected and shared online. Some nurses have embraced these tools and use them in professional ways to support clinical decision-making (Farrell, 2016; Gartrell et al., 2018), education (O'Connor, Jolliffe, Stanmore, Renwick & Booth, 2018) and learning (O'Connor & Andrews, 2018). However, McBride, LeVasseur, and Li (2015) noted that nurses sometimes use personal mobile phones or other communication devices for private reasons such as sending text messages or reading the news during working hours, outside of breaks and meal times. A further worry is the unprofessional behaviour displayed by some nurses online, who post inappropriate images or comments about patients, colleagues or their workplace on social media (Wang, Wang, Zhang, & Jiang, 2019). Despite the potential benefits of mobile technologies to advance professional practice and patient care, there appears to be a lack of trust that nurses can use them appropriately. Some studies have reported resistance to nurses using personal mobile devices in clinical settings, as there were concerns this could be perceived as unprofessional by patients, families or colleagues (Beauregard, Arnaert, & Ponzoni, 2017; Johansson, Petersson, & Nilsson, 2012). In some countries, such as Australia, policies also restrict the use of mobile devices in clinical environments (Mather, Cummings, & Gale, 2018). Furthermore, McNally, Frey, and Crossan (2017) found that some nurse managers were unable to distinguish between private and professional use of personal mobile devices (i.e. smartphones) by nursing students. Hence, they preferred to prohibit this technology in hospital settings as regulating when, where, and how they could be used was challenging. This view of digital professionalism seems to be particularly problematic for nursing students, most of whom have grown up with technology and are keen to use it in their clinical practice to find and retrieve information and apply new knowledge and skills (Lee, Carson, Clarke, Yang, & Nam, 2019). A paradox in relation to digital professionalism is evolving, as district and community nurses are being encouraged in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland, to use mobile devices to access and record patient information (Royal College of Nursing, 2017; Swiss Nurses Association, 2019), while their counterparts in hospital settings are not. Although there is better digital infrastructure in acute care, nurses can have limited access to and use of computers (Zadvinskis, Smith, & Yen, 2018). As health services move towards documenting care electronically, a lack of computer availability may restrict the efficiency and efficacy of nurses when working in multidisciplinary teams. One solution, proposed by Parker (2014), would be to equip every nurse with an employer provided mobile device, preloaded with all the required software applications and security features that could be used in clinical practice. This approach is being implemented in some hospitals in the United States (Mobile Heartbeat, 2019), although it is not widespread practice. The landscape of digital professionalism is further complicated by other groups of health professionals such as physicians who also use personal mobile devices in clinical environments. This can create confusion among nurses and nursing students about what is considered acceptable practice. Dimond, Bullock, Lovatt, and Stacey (2016) contend that mobile devices should be as much a part of a junior physician's armoury as a stethoscope, given the wealth of information that is accessible via this technology to facilitate clinical decision-making at the point of care. Furthermore, some health services are developing mobile apps specifically for physicians and nurses to aid decision-making (Davies et al., 2017). And yet, some may not be able to use these apps due to concerns around personal mobile devices and digital professionalism. One could argue not using mobile technology in nursing might be unethical in a sense, if these tools could be used to improve patient care and as many nurses cannot use them, there is limited evidence on whether mobile apps for nurses could have a positive impact. Perhaps the way forward, is a pragmatic one, where the needs of nurses and nursing students are balanced with the perspectives of patients, families, health service managers, and others. More robust research on the effectiveness of mobile devices and apps used by nurses to improve patient and other outcomes is needed. If the benefits of using this technology in day-to-day clinical practice do not outweigh the risks of doing so, then it should be adopted. Hence, a more nuanced approach that considers the values and needs of multiple stakeholders regarding digital professionalism is needed. Educating nursing students and nurses about safe and appropriate use of mobile devices could prepare them to work in more effective ways and avoid some of the risks associated with mobile technology. Best practice guidelines regarding digital professionalism, including how mobile platforms should be used in clinical settings, could be co-designed with all relevant groups. Stakeholder consultation could ensure that all perspectives are considered and agreement can be reached on the values and behaviours that underpin what is acceptable and professional digital practice. These could assist with informing institutional policies and be used to strengthen the training and education of nursing students, nurses and nurse managers and guide leaders in legitimising the use of mobile technology in healthcare. The guidelines could also be displayed in clinical areas to remind staff and students to use technology appropriately and reassure patients and families of this. A global approach, where internationally agreed guidelines on digital professionalism are developed, may also facilitate consistent adoption worldwide. Making these changes could contribute to ensuring nurses and nursing students demonstrate professional use of technology and continue to deliver high quality care in a digital and mobile world. No conflict of interest has been declared by the authors.","['professionalism', 'digital', 'mobile', 'world:', 'forward', 'nursing']"
"Learning from a cluster randomized controlled trial to improve healthcare workers’ access to prevention and care for tuberculosis and HIV in Free State, South Africa: the pivotal role of information systems",2016,"BackgroundOccupational tuberculosis (TB) continues to plague the healthcare workforce in South Africa. A 2-year cluster randomized controlled trial was therefore launched in 27 public hospitals in Free State province, to better understand how a combined workforce and workplace program can improve health of the healthcare workforce.ObjectiveThis mid-term evaluation aimed to analyze how well the intervention was being implemented, seek evidence of impact or harm, and draw lessons.MethodsBoth intervention and comparison sites had been instructed to conduct bi-annual and issue-based infection control assessments (when healthcare workers [HCW] are diagnosed with TB) and offer HCWs confidential TB and HIV counseling and testing, TB treatment and prophylaxis for HIV-positive HCWs. Intervention sites were additionally instructed to conduct quarterly workplace assessments, and also offer HCWs HIV treatment at their occupational health units (OHUs). Trends in HCW mortality, sick-time, and turnover rates (2005–2014) were analyzed from the personnel salary database ('PERSAL'). Data submitted by the OHUs were also analyzed. Open-ended questionnaires were then distributed to OHU HCWs and in-depth interviews conducted at 17 of the sites to investigate challenges encountered.ResultsOHUs reported identifying and treating 23 new HCW cases of TB amongst the 1,372 workers who used the OHU for HIV and/or TB services; 39 new cases of HIV were also identified and 108 known-HIV-positive HCWs serviced. Although intervention-site workforces used these services significantly more than comparison-site healthcare staff (p<0.001), the data recorded were incomplete for both the intervention and comparison OHUs. An overall significant decline in mortality and turnover rates was documented over this period, but no significant differences between intervention and comparison sites; sick-time data proved unreliable. Severe OHU workload as well as residual confidentiality concerns prevented the proper implementation of protocols, especially workplace assessments and data recording. Particularly, the failure to implement computerized data collection required OHU staff to duplicate their operational data collection duties by also entering research paper forms. The study was therefore halted pending the implementation of a computerized system.ConclusionsThe significant differences in OHU use documented cannot be attributable to the intervention due to incomplete data reporting; unreliable sick-time data further precluded ascertaining the benefit potentially attributable to the intervention. Computerized data collection is essential to facilitate operational monitoring while conducting real-world intervention research. The digital divide still requires the attention of researchers along with overall infrastructural constraints.","['learning', 'cluster', 'randomized', 'controlled', 'trial', 'improve', 'healthcare', 'workers’', 'access', 'prevention', 'care', 'tuberculosis', 'free', 'state,', 'south', 'africa:', 'pivotal', 'role', 'information', 'systems']"
"New Generations and Employment – An Exploratory Study about Tensions Between the Psycho-social Characteristics of the Generation Z and Expectations and Actions of Organizational Structures Related with Employment (CABA, 2016).",2016,"&lt;p&gt;Generational studies have an important research tradition in social and human sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the speed of social change in the context of globalization imposes the need to research the transformations are identified both the subjectivity of the agents involved and its inclusion in the institutional matrix, specifically employment. Generation Z, (generally considered as the population group whose birth occurs after 1995) have unique psycho-social characteristics. Gen Z is characterized by a different set of values, beliefs, attitudes and ambitions that impact in their concrete action in organizational structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, managers often have to deal with generational differences in the workplace. Organizations have members who belong to different generations; they had never before faced the challenge of having such a diverse group of members. The members of each historical generation are characterized by a different set of values, beliefs, attitudes and ambitions that are manifest in their concrete action in organizational structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gen Z it’s the only one who can fully be considered ""global"", while its members were born in the consolidated context of globalization. Some salient features of the Generation Z can be summarized as follows. They’re the first fully born into a digital world. Social networks and technology are integrated into their lives. They are concerned about the challenges of the modern world (poverty, inequality, climate change, among others). They are self-expressive, more liberal and open to change. They often bore easily, with short attention spans. They do not like routine tasks. They want to achieve a good life-work balance and they are interested in a flexible work environment, as opposed to traditional work schedule. They are critical thinkers, who come with innovative and creative ideas to help. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research design considered methodological triangulation. Data was collected with two techniques: a self-administered survey with multiple choice questions and attitudinal scales applied over a non-probabilistic sample by reasoned decision. According to the multi-method strategy, also it was conducted in-depth interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations constantly face new challenges. One of the biggest ones is to learn to manage a multi-generational scope of work. While Gen Z has not yet been fully incorporated (expected to do so in five years or so), many organizations have already begun to implement a series of changes in its recruitment and development. The main obstacle to retaining young talent is the gap between the expectations of iGen applicants and what companies offer. Members of the iGen expect not only a good salary and job stability, but also a clear career plan. Generation Z needs to have immediate feedback of their tasks. However, many organizations have yet to improve both motivation and monitoring practices. It is essential for companies to take a review of organizational practices anchored in the culture of the organization. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","['generations', 'employment', 'exploratory', 'study', 'about', 'tensions', 'between', 'psycho-social', 'characteristics', 'generation', 'expectations', 'actions', 'organizational', 'structures', 'related', 'employment', '(caba,', '2016).']"
A Hybrid Digital Twin Scheme for the Condition Monitoring of Industrial Collaborative Robots,2024,"Industrial collaborative robots play an essential role in smart manufacturing because they improve productivity while also ensuring workplace safety. However, the development of prognostic and health management systems to ensure the reliability of these robots has been a major challenge due to the lack of fault data. This paper proposed a digital twin scheme based on the fusion of the robot kinematic and dynamic models' information down to the powertrains (i.e., the joints motor, and gear) along with the control algorithms and uncertainty accommodation based upon deep learning. The presented digital twin concept has the potential to propel simulation-based fault prediction. We also highlight and discuss challenges and opportunities around the development of the hybrid digital twin for condition monitoring of industrial collaborative robots.","['hybrid', 'digital', 'twin', 'scheme', 'condition', 'monitoring', 'industrial', 'collaborative', 'robots']"

Methods of automation of the employment process on the basis of ratings,2020,"It is necessary to create an online communication environment between the employer and the specialist on the basis of digital technologies, that is, each specialist should have a high-quality workplace based on the formation of a rating of knowledge and achievements in the learning process. This paper discusses automation models for determining the ranking and employment of university students on the basis of academic performance, scientific and creative achievements, spiritual and educational achievements. The question of determining the rating of each student, the rating of a university and the ranking of university areas on the basis of mastering subjects, personal achievements, organizing spiritual and educational activities and participating in it was studied. Based on the solution to this problem, it will be possible to satisfy the demand for high-quality personnel and control employment. To automate the evaluation process, its mathematical modeling were carried and the parameters of the mathematical model were determined. Based on the rating, an infological and general model of a system for monitoring employment and labor relations of industry potential for employers has been developed.","['methods', 'automation', 'employment', 'process', 'basis', 'ratings']"
Problems and suggested improvement plans for occupational health service in Korea,2023,"The purpose of this paper was to review the problems relating to Korea's occupational health services and suggest ways to improve them. Korea can be classified as a welfare state type of conservative corporatism partially interwoven with liberalism. While experiencing compressed economic growth, the economic sectors of developed (excess areas) and developing (deficient areas) countries are interwoven. Therefore, it is necessary to perfect conservative corporatism along with a complementary reinforcement of liberal contents and to apply a multilayered approach focusing on complementing the deficient areas. It is essential to form a national representative indicator related to occupational health, and a strategy for selection and concentration is needed. The proposed central indicator is the occupational health coverage rate (OHCR), which is the number of workers who have applied for mandatory occupational health services under the Occupational Safety and Health Act in the numerator with the total working population in the denominator. This paper proposes ways to raise the OHCR, which is currently at the level of 25%-40%, to 70%-80%, which is the level of Japan, Germany, and France. To achieve this target, it is necessary to focus on small businesses and vulnerable workers. This is an area of market failure and requires the active input of community-oriented public resources. For access to larger workplaces, the marketability of services should be strengthened and personal intervention using digital health resources should be actively attempted. Taking a national perspective, work environment improvement committees with tripartite (labor, management, and government) participation for improvement of the working environment need to be established at the center and in the regions. Through this, prevention funds linked to industrial accident compensation and prevention could be used efficiently. A national chemical substance management system must be established to monitor the health of workers and the general public.","['problems', 'suggested', 'improvement', 'plans', 'occupational', 'health', 'service', 'korea']"
CO<sub>2</sub> MEASUREMENTS FOR UNCONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF INDOOR AIR QUALITY,2019,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a known global pollutant and is responsible for the global warming that the planet has been experiencing for the last few decades.On a local scale, outdoor CO2 does not pose any risk for the environment and humans.Risks are usually far from involving human beings in the majority of indoor environments, although high CO2 concentrations may entail temporary adverse effects that are similar to the typical symptoms of the so-called ""sick-building syndrome"".Such effects become even more important on workplaces or at school/university, since high CO2 levels may negatively influence the productivity and the learning capability of individuals.To understand the magnitude of the problem, a monitoring campaign was carried out in four classrooms and in a library of a university in northern Italy.Three of the classrooms under observation were not equipped with an air extraction system.The CO2 concentration was monitored with low-cost non-dispersive infrared digital sensors in two periods of the year: between February and March and at the end of May.During those periods, the number of occupants, temperature and relative humidity were also monitored, as well as any opening of the windows (where available).The results showed that, where automatic air extraction is not available, CO2 concentrations can exceed 5,000 ppm.In general, the lower the ratio between the room volume and the number of occupants, the higher the concentrations achieved.The installation of lowcost sensors might prove useful to prevent the negative effects from the exposure to high CO2 levels and help achieve more sustainable conditions in indoor spaces, since the sensors could inform lecturers and students on the need for opening doors and/or windows when air extraction is not provided.","['co<sub>2</sub>', 'measurements', 'unconventional', 'management', 'indoor', 'quality']"
Cooperative Mentorship: Negotiating Social Media Use within the Family,2016,"IntroductionAccounts of mentoring relationships inevitably draw attention to hierarchies of expertise, knowledge and learning. While public concerns about both the risks and benefits for young people of social media, little attention has been given to the nature of the mentoring role that parents and families play alongside of schools. This conceptual paper explores models of mentorship in the context of family dynamics as they are affected by social media use. This is a context that explicitly disrupts hierarchical structures of mentoring in that new media, and particularly social media use, tends to be driven by youth cultural practices, identity formation, experimentation and autonomy-seeking practices (see for example: Robards; boyd; Campos-Holland et al.; Hodkinson). A growing body of research supports the notion that young people are more skilled in navigating social media platforms than their parents (FOSI; Campos-Holland et al.). This research establishes that uncertainty and tension derived from parents’ impression that their children know more about social media they do (FOSI; Sorbring) has brought about a market for advice and educational programs. In the content of this paper it is notable that when family dynamics and young people’s social media use are addressed through notions of digital citizenship or cyber safety programs, a hierarchical mentorship is assumed, but also problematised; thus the expertise hierarchy is inverted. This paper argues that use of social media platforms, networks, and digital devices challenges traditional hierarchies of expertise in family environments. Family members, parents and children in particular, are involved in ongoing, complex conversations and negotiations about expertise in relation to technology and social media use. These negotiations open up an alternative space for mentorship, challenging traditional roles and suggesting the need for cooperative processes. And this, in turn, can inspire new ways of relating with and through social media and mobile technologies within the family.Inverting Expertise: Social Media, Family and MentoringSocial media are deeply embedded in everyday routines for the vast majority of the population. The emergence of the ‘networked society’, characterised by increasing and pervasive digital and social connectivity, has the potential to create new forms of social interactions within and across networks (Rainie and Wellman), but also to reconfigure intergenerational and family relations. In this way, social media introduces new power asymmetries that affect family dynamics and in particular relationships between young people and their parents. This relatively new mediated environment, by default, exposes young people to social contexts well beyond family and immediate peers making their lived experiences individual, situational and contextual (Swist et al.). The perceived risks this introduces can provoke tensions within families looking to manage those uncertain social contexts, in the process problematising traditional structures of mentorship. Mentoring is a practice predominantly understood within educational and professional workplace settings (Ambrosetti and Dekkers). Although different definitions can be found across disciplines, most models position a mentor as a more experienced knowledge holder, implying a hierarchical relationship between a mentor and mentee (Ambrosetti and Dekkers). Stereotypically, a mentor is understood to be older, wiser and more experienced, while a mentee is, in turn, younger and in need of guidance – a protégé. Alternative models of mentorship see mentoring as a reciprocal process (Eby, Rhodes and Allen; Naweed and Ambrosetti).This “reciprocal” perspective on mentorship recognises the opportunity both sides in the process have to contribute and benefit from the relationship. However, in situations where one party in the relationship does not have the expected knowledge, skills or confidence, this reciprocity becomes more difficult. Thus, as an alternative, asymmetrical or cooperative mentorship lies between the hierarchical and reciprocal (Naweed and Ambrosetti). It suggests that the more experienced side (whichever it is) takes a lead while mentoring is negotiated in a way that meets both sides’ needs. The parent-child relationship is generally understood in hierarchical terms. Traditionally, parents are considered to be mentors for their children, particularly in acquiring new skills and facilitating transitions towards adult life. Such perspectives on parent-child relationships are based on a “deficit” approach to youth, “whereby young people are situated as citizens-in-the-making” (Collin). Social media further problematises the hierarchical dynamic with the role of knowledge holder varying between and within the family members. In many contemporary mediated households, across developed and wealthy nations, technologically savvy children are actively tailoring their own childhoods. This is a context that requires a reconceptualisation of traditional mentoring models within the family context and recognition of each stakeholder’s expertise, knowledge and agency – a position that is markedly at odds with traditional deficit models. Negotiating Social Media Use within the FamilyIn the early stages of the internet and social media research, a generational gap was often at the centre of debates. Although highly contested, Prensky’s metaphor of digital natives and digital immigrants persists in both the popular media and academic literature. This paradigm portrays young people as tech savvy in contrast with their parents. However, such assumptions are rarely grounded in empirical evidence (Hargittai). Nonetheless, while parents are active users of social media, they find it difficult to negotiate social media use with their children (Sorbring). Some studies suggest that parental concerns arise from impressions that their children know more about social media than they do (FOSI; Wang, Bianchi and Raley). Additionally, parental concern with a child’s social media use is positively correlated with the child’s age; parents of older children are less confident in their skills and believe that their child is more digitally skillful (FOSI). However, it may be more productive to understand social media expertise within the family as shared: intermittently fluctuating between parents and children. In developed and wealthy countries, children are already using digital media by the age of five and throughout their pre-teen years predominantly for play and learning, and as teenagers they are almost universally avid social media users (Nansen; Nansen et al.; Swist et al.). Smartphone ownership has increased significantly among young people in Australia, reaching almost 80% in 2015, a proportion nearly identical to the adult population (Australian Communications and Media Authority). In addition, most young people are using multiple devices switching between them according to where, when and with whom they connect (Australian Communications and Media Authority). The locations of internet use have also diversified. While the home remains the most common site, young people make use of mobile devices to access the internet at school, friend’s homes, and via public Wi-Fi hotspots (Australian Communications and Media Authority). As a result, social media access and engagement has become more frequent and personalised and tied to processes of socialisation and well-being (Sorbring; Swist et al.). These developments have been rapid, introducing asymmetry into the parent-child mentoring dynamic along with family tensions about rules, norms and behaviours of media use. Negotiating an appropriate balance between emerging autonomy and parental oversight has always featured as a primary parenting challenge and social media seem to have introduced a new dimension in this context. A 2016 Pew report on parents, teens, and digital monitoring reveals that social media use has become central to the establishment of family rules and disciplinary practices, with over two thirds of parents reporting the use of “digital grounding” as punishment (Pew). As well as restricting social media use, the majority of parents report limiting the amount of time and times of day their children can be online. Interestingly, while parents engage in a variety of hands-on approaches to monitoring and regulating children’s social media use, they are less likely to use monitoring software, blocking/filtering online content, tracking locations and the like (Pew). These findings suggest that parents may lack confidence in technology-based restrictions or prefer pro-active, family based approaches involving discussion about appropriate social media use. This presents an opportunity to explore how social media produces new forms of parent-child relationships that might be best understood through the lens of cooperative models of mentorship. Digital Parenting: Technological and Pedagogical Interventions Parents along with educators and policy makers are looking for technological solutions to the knowledge gap, whether perceived or real, associated with concerns regarding young people’s social media use. Likewise, technology and social media companies are rushing to develop and sell advice, safety filters and resources of all kinds to meet such parental needs (Clark; McCosker). This relatively under-researched field requires further exploration and dissociation from the discourse of risk and fear (Livingstone). Furthermore, in order to develop opportunities modelled on concepts of cooperative mentoring, such programs and interventions need to move away from hierarchical assumptions about the nature of expertise within family contexts. As Collin and Swist point out, online campaigns aimed at addressing young people and children’s safety and wellbeing “are often still designed by adult ‘experts’” (Collin and Swist). A cooperative mentoring approach within family contexts would align with recent use of co-design or participatory design within social and health research and policy (Collin and Swist). In order to think through the potential of cooperative mentorship approaches in relation to social media use within the family, we examine some of the digital resources available to parents.Prominent US cyber safety and digital citizenship program Cyberwise is a commercial website founded by Diana Graber and Cynthia Lieberman, with connections to Verizon Wireless, Google and iKeepSafe among many other partnerships. In addition to learning resources around topics like “Being a Responsible Citizen of the Digital World”, Cyberwise offers online and face to face workshops on “cyber civics” in California, emphasising critical thinking, ethical discussion and decision making about digital media issues. The organisation aims to educate and support parents and teachers in their endeavor to guide young people in civil and safe social media use. CyberWise’s slogan “No grown up left behind!”, and its program of support and education is underpinned by and maintains the notion of adults as lacking expertise and lagging behind young people in digital literacy and social media skills. In the process, it introduces an additional level of expertise in the cyber safety expert and software-based interventions. Through a number of software partners, CyberWise provides a suite of tools that offer parents some control in preventing cyberbullying and establishing norms for cyber safety. For example, Frienedy is a dedicated social media platform that fosters a more private mode of networking for closed groups of mutually known people. It enables users to control completely what they share and with whom they share it. The tool does not introduce any explicit parental monitoring mechanisms, but seeks to impose an exclusive online environment divested of broader social influences and risks – an environment in which parents can “introduce kids to social media on their terms when they are ready”. Although Frienedy does not explicitly present itself as a monitoring tool, it does perpetuate hierarchical forms of mentorship and control for parents. On the other hand, PocketGuardian is a parental monitoring service for tracking children’s social media use, with an explicit emphasis on parental control: “Parents receive notification when cyberbullying or sexting is detected, plus resources to start a conversation with their child without intruding child’s privacy” (the software notifies parents when it detects an issue but without disclosing the content). The tool promotes its ability to step in on behalf of parents, removing “the task of manually inspecting your child's device and accounts”. The software claims that it analyses the content rather than merely catching “keywords” in its detection algorithms. Obviously, tools such as PocketGuardian reflect a hierarchical mentorship model (and recognise the expertise asymmetry) by imposing technological controls. The software, in a way, fosters a fear of expertise deficiency, while enabling technological controls to reassert the parent-child hierarchy. A different approach is exemplified by the Australian based Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre, a “living lab” experiment – this is an overt attempt to reverse deliberate asymmetry. This pedagogical intervention, initially taking the form of an research project, involved four young people designing and delivering a three-hour workshop on social networking and cyber safety for adult participants (Third et al.). The central aim was to disrupt the traditional way adults and young people relate to each other in relation to social media and technology use and attempted to support learning by reversing traditional roles of adult teacher and young student. In this way ‘a non-hierarchical space of intergenerational learning’ was created (Third et al.). The result was to create a setting where intergenerational conversation helped to demystify social media and technology, generate familiarity with sites, improve adult’s understanding of when they should assist young people, and deliver agency and self-efficacy for the young people involved (7-8). In this way, young people’s expertise was acknowledged as a reflection of a cooperative or asymmetrical mentoring relationship in which adult’s guidance and support could also play a part. These lessons have been applied and developed further through a participatory design approach to producing apps and tools such as Appreciate-a-mate (Collin and Swist). In that project “the inclusion of young people’s contexts became a way of activating and sustaining attachments in regard to the campaign’s future use”(313).In stark contrast to the CyberWise tools, the cooperative mentoring (or participatory design) approach, exemplified in this second example, has multiple positive outcomes: first it demystifies social media use and increases understanding of the role it plays in young people’s (and adults’) lives. Second, it increases adults’ familiarity and comfort in navigating their children’s social media use. Finally, for the young people involved, it supports a sense of achievement and acknowledges their expertise and agency. To build sustainability into these processes, we would argue that it is important to look at the family context and cooperative mentorship as an additional point of intervention. Understood in this sense, cooperative and asymmetrical mentoring between a parent and child echoes an authoritative parenting style which is proven to have the best outcome for children (Baumrind), but in a way that accommodates young people’s technology expertise.Both programs analysed target adults (parents) as less skilful than young people (their children) in relation to social media use. However, while first case study, the technology based interventions endorses hierarchical model, the Living Lab example (a pedagogical intervention) attempts to create an environment without hierarchical obstacles to learning and knowledge exchange. Although the parent-child relationship is indubitably characterised by the hierarchy to some extent, it also assumes continuous negotiation and role fluctuation. A continuous process, negotiation intensifies as children age and transition to more independent media use. In the current digital environment, this negotiation is often facilitated (or even led) by social media platforms as additional agents in the process. Unarguably, digital parenting might implicate both technological and pedagogical interventions; however, there should be a dialogue between the two. Without presumed expertise roles, non-hierarchical, cooperative environment for negotiating social media use can be developed. Cooperative mentorship, as a concept, offers an opportunity to connect research and practice through participatory design and it deserves further consideration.ConclusionsPrevailing approaches to cyber safety education tend to focus on risk management and in doing so, they maintain hierarchical forms of parental control. Adhering to such methods fails to acknowledge young people’s expertise and further deepens generational misunderstanding over social media use. Rather than insisting on hierarchical and traditional roles, there is a need to recognise and leverage asymmetrical expertise within the family in regards to social media.Cooperative and asymmetrical mentorship happens naturally in the family and can be facilitated by and through social media. The inverted hierarchy of expertise we have described here puts both parents and children, in a position of constant negotiation over social media use. This negotiation is complex, relational, unpredictable, open toward emergent possibilities and often intensive. Unquestionably, it is clear that social media provides opportunities for negotiation over, and inversion of, traditional family roles. Whether this inversion of expertise is real or only perceived, however, deserves further investigation. This article formulates some of the conceptual groundwork for an empirical study of family dynamics in relation to social media use and rulemaking. The study aims to continue to probe the positive potential of cooperative and asymmetrical mentorship and participatory design concepts and practices. The idea of cooperative mentorship does not necessarily provide a universal solution to how families negotiate social media use, but it does provide a new lens through which this dynamic can be observed. Clearly family dynamics, and the parent-child relationship, in particular, can play a vital part in supporting effective digital citizenship and wellbeing processes. Learning about this spontaneous and natural process of family negotiations might equip us with tools to inform policy and practices that can help parents and children to collaboratively create ‘a networked world in which they all want to live’ (boyd).

New Concerns in Electronic Employee Monitoring: Have You Checked Your Policies Lately?,2015,"INTRODUCTION Employers have long had compelling reasons to monitor employees. For example, management at Los Angeles California City Hall discovered that employees were streaming the 2012 Summer Olympics over the corporate network while at work. Management's response: Stop watching the Olympics at work! (Winton, 2012). Events like the Olympics or the annual March Madness basketball tournament impact corporate networks during very specific times, but imagine an employer monitoring its network and discovering that every day employees are watching over 50,000 YouTube videos, streaming over 4,000 hours of music over the internet, or streaming movies from Netflix. This discovery, in fact, prompted Proctor & Gamble to shut down access to movies from Netflix and music from Pandora for its 129,000 employees (Schwartz, 2012). Ensuring employee productivity is a major consideration to support the monitoring processes. But employers have also long been aware of the risk of legal liability or loss to which their organizations may be exposed as a result of inappropriate employee activities online (Papa & Bass, 2004). Lawsuits based on online harassment are typically cited as a concern that justifies employee monitoring, but these are by no means the only legal claims that can arise from employee activity online. In recent years, employee activity on social media outlets, along with employer responses to such activity, have increasingly exposed organizations to liability for unlawful discrimination (Gaskell v. University of Kentucky, 2010), violation of labor laws (Hispanics United of Buffalo, Inc., 2012), and even violation of securities laws (Bondi & Lofchie, 2011). In addition to legal liability for employee misconduct, employers are concerned about threats to their organization's intellectual property as vital data and information are increasingly stored in digital format that is easy for employees to access and distribute outside of the organization's protocols (Willey, Ford, White & Clapper, 2011). To support and justify employee monitoring, employers have adopted policies that attempt to define the limits of permissible employee online activity and identify forms of impermissible online activity that might expose the organization to legal liability or loss. As with all best business practices, it is not enough to simply develop an employee monitoring policy. Successful organizations regularly review and update their policies and review the enforcement of those policies to ensure that they are addressing current concerns in a way that complies with state and federal laws (Rozwell, 2012). The monitoring of employees' emails, internet usage, telephone communications and social media gives rise to confusing legal responses. While some law supports the necessity of monitoring, other law exists to limit the electronic monitoring of employees to protect employee privacy, leaving employers between a rock and hard place. On top of these concerns, recent rulings by the National Labor Relations Board confound the problem for organizations by strictly interpreting monitoring policies that could impact employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act. Additionally, numerous states have either enacted or are considering legislation that would limit the use of social media as a monitoring tool. It's time to take out those monitoring policies, dust them off, and be sure the organization's policies comply with law. AN HISTORICAL LOOK AT ELECTRONIC MONITORING AND A LOOK AT RECENT TRENDS Business organizations are able to use hardware and software to electronically monitor a wide variety of employee behaviors both in and out of the workplace. Attendance and facility use can be monitored using video surveillance and through employee badges where entry and time spent in various access areas is logged. In addition, new applications for physical access cards provide authentication and access to digital systems which may ultimately lead to the convergence of Information Technology (IT) security and physical security (Walls, 2012a). …","['concerns', 'electronic', 'employee', 'monitoring:', 'have', 'checked', 'your', 'policies', 'lately?']"
A Seat at the Table: Negotiating Data Processing in the Workplace. A National Case Study and Comparative Insights,2019,"It is already a common understanding that datafication is one of the most important trends in our society and, as a consequence, in the economic environment. Datafication and big data are not only the core of the two most debated new business and technological models - platform economy and Industry 4.0 (or smart manufacturing) - but have also permeated more traditional organizations, entering all their departments (marketing, production, sales, finance). In the latest years, datafication is becoming ever more a reality in work organization and human resource management, considerably impacting on the way work is organized, managed and performed. Stemming from this background, this paper wants to analyze the topic of data processing in the employment context focusing on the specific role that collective representation can play. Although there are some interesting antecedents in research regarding the role of workers’ representatives in this context, the topic has received very limited attention as far as the new wave of digitalization is concerned, and almost no interest in its double -- individual and collective -- dimension. By contrast, we believe that ongoing technological and organizational changes raise new challenges and open a new room for intervention for workers’ representatives. In this sense, they are expected not only to limit the quantity and fix the typologies of data collected and processed, against the risk of workers’ surveillance, but also to co-decide over purposes and procedures of data processing, for the self-determination and concrete participation of workers. Negotiating the algorithm, in our opinion, starts here. In order to achieve the above-mentioned purposes, a case study analysis is developed and focused on the Italian context. Firstly, we focus on the legal framework to shed light on the prerogatives and powers formally attributed to workers’ representatives in the field of data protection and workplace monitoring. Emphasis will be placed on the changes made by the so-called Jobs Act reform from September 2015. Secondly, we examine a set of 1,161 company-level collective agreements concluded in Italy between late September 2015 and 2018 to investigate the actual role played by labor representation in this field. Moreover, we provide some insights into other national contexts, with a view to comparing the results of our analysis with the negotiated outcomes achieved in other countries, in an attempt to better understand the institutional determinants of varieties of actors’ orientations and collective solutions.","['seat', 'table:', 'negotiating', 'data', 'processing', 'workplace.', 'national', 'case', 'study', 'comparative', 'insights']"
WORKPLACE PRIVACY IN THE EU : THE IMPACT OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ON EMPLOYEE’S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS,2023,"Over the last decade, several new technologies have been adopted that enable more systematic surveillance of employees, creating significant challenges to privacy and data protection. The risks posed by the new devices and methods were exacerbated with the advent of Covid, with the involuntary introduction of digital tools to measure work output and efforts to get visibility back in the workplace through new means. Against this backdrop, the article aims to examine the main issues in workplace surveillance. After a brief overview of the range of surveillance methods, such as video surveillance, network and e-mail monitoring, and employee tracking softwares (the so-called “bossware”), as well as the challenges posed by the new technologies, the paper goes on to individually analyse the legal aspects of monitoring employees for security or performance-related reasons. The phenomenon is examined in light of relevant EU legislation (the General Data Protection Regulation of 2016 being the most relevant one), as well as the opinions adopted by the Article 29 Working Party established by Directive 95/46 and the guidelines drawn up by the European Data Protection Board, established by the GDPR and replacing the WP. In doing so, the paper will elaborate on the concept of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, data retention, the so-called expectation of privacy, and the lawfulness of processing, especially the issue of balancing the legitimate interests of the employer against the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject. The results of the analysis suggest that new and emerging technologies developed to monitor employees in order to address productivity issues, security risks, and sexual harassment, combined with the fact that remote and hybrid work becomes the norm inevitably increase the porosity between work and private life and blur the line between public and private. Such an extensive intrusion into privacy calls for enhanced institutional efforts to protect workers from the surveillance overreach of the new digital devices.","['workplace', 'privacy', 'impact', 'emerging', 'technologies', 'employee’s', 'fundamental', 'rights']"

Microchipping Employees: Unlawful Monitoring Practice or a New Trend in the Workplace?,2020,"A specific technology has been making its way into a growing number of workplaces. In addition to computer screen recording, video surveillance, keystroke monitoring, location tracking and social media monitoring, employers can now use microchips as an additional tool to monitor employee activity. These microchips give new abilities to employees and replace credit cards, keys, passwords and bracelets. Indeed, microchips allow employees to automatically open doors, trigger computers or printers and pay for purchases. Despite these useful qualities, microchips may bring forth several possible legal concerns, such as the possibility to covert and constant surveillance, profiling and digital discrimination. As this innovative technology appears destined to further challenge regulatory frameworks, this chapter aims to provide answers to the following research questions: is GDPR applicable in case of microchipping? If GDPR is applicable in these situations, then under what legislative grounds can microchipping be lawfully accommodated? Also, as each EU Member State could provide more specific rules under the GDPR to safeguard the employees' right of personal data, the chapter analyses whether more specific national rules are needed in order to protect microchipped employees.","['microchipping', 'employees:', 'unlawful', 'monitoring', 'practice', 'trend', 'workplace?']"
"Employee monitoring, productivity, privacy and harassment: Auditing technology training and adoption in public administration",2022,"Organizational intentions may be focused on enhancing productivity and managing digital age business risks through the adoption sof employee monitoring technology, it may, however, be perceived as an unnecessary intrusion of the privacy space of employees at the workplace which may develop a reaction towards non-adoption and / or intentional resistance towards such automation. Auditing employee intentions before the initiation of any change in the technology space in the organization is a vital strategy for any sort of change management. In this context, current study surveys the public sector employees in the economy of Brunei Darussalam. The study has three research objectives which may be described as the organizational dimensions of the application of monitoring technology at the organization regarding having privacy policies and training opportunities for employees, to understand the intentions of employees for using monitoring technology. A survey of public sector employees has been conducted in Brunei's economy using paper based questionnaires as well as using Google forms which has generated 149 responses ready for analysis using Cronbach's Alpha, Correlation, and Linear Regression methods. The study has found that employees are not very enthusiastic to use employee-monitoring technology for the sake of increasing organizational productivity or profitability. However, as the technology can decrease the unnecessary harassment at the workplace, therefore, this variable has reflected their intention to adopt to even employee-monitoring technology if implemented at the workplace.","['employee', 'monitoring,', 'productivity,', 'privacy', 'harassment:', 'auditing', 'technology', 'training', 'adoption', 'public', 'administration']"
Nursing leadership challenges and opportunities,2017,"Nursing is well placed to plan, respond and lead in these current times of significant change and through the future predicted changes within the healthcare landscape. There is a need to look inside and outside health literature and the nursing frame of reference to inform our thinking about the opportunities and challenges into the future for nursing practice and nursing leadership. The World Economic Forum (2016) has highlighted that ""Disruptive changes to business models will have a profound impact on the employment landscape over the coming years"" (p3). What might this mean to nursing? This will require a proactive approach to service planning, delivery and evaluation of patient care from both the patient and health care provider perspectives. Nursing requires leaders who are highly creative in their thinking, to be able to piece together multiple pieces of seemingly unrelated information, and test out new approaches in the pursuit of new meaning in support of nursing patient care (The World Economic Forum, 2016; Courtney, Nash, Thornton, & Potgieter, 2015). It will no longer be about the ""nursing leader""; rather it will be about nursing leaders working with other health-related leaders and consumers. Global predictions of essential skills for occupations required by 2020 encompass complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management, coordinating with others, emotional intelligence, judgement and decision-making, service orientation, negotiation and cognitive flexibility. These are the capabilities required now of nursing leaders. It will be the changing context that will need to be navigated with a further focus on interprofessional planning and delivery of care to achieve the desired patient care outcomes. The World Health Economic Forum (2016) has intriguingly suggested that the critical skill sets of most occupations by 2020 will be those we have not yet considered. With the increasing complexity of health care, we need adaptive leadership approaches which critically analyze the complex problem-solving required within an ever-changing health context. Adaptive leadership brings together people from different fields and levels of experience to work through the ""wicked problems"" (those problems that do not have one answer or known answers). Adaptive leadership is a collaboration of key stakeholders to identify and test possible approaches towards shedding light on complex challenges. This process specifically supports a range of change options that promote the capacity to thrive (Heifetz, Grashow, & Linsky, 2009). Many organisations employ leadership development and succession planning to build leadership capacity over time. Organisations do not necessarily have the connective tissue required for the breadth of leadership development strategy solutions required into the future (Delloitte (2011). They recommend viewing the leadership development strategy and resource requirements as one system, to establish the connective tissue required for success. This approach supports the development of leaders in a systematic way with visibility of the resources required for the pipeline of leaders into the future. Moving away from professional silos to interprofessional leadership gives birth to the multiple perspectives required of contemporary patient-centered practices. The health landscape is dotted with disparate technologies (Risling, 2017). The tapestry is now enriched and complicated by new e-systems to manage health related data. Improving digital literacy is an emerging area of competence for many professionals and industries: ""The productive and innovative use of technology encompasses 21st century practices that are vital for success in the workplace and beyond"" (NMC Horizon Report, 2017 p 24). Data analytics is a core capability of leaders and managers navigating the complexities of the health landscape. Data analytics is an essential thread in the health tapestry that interweaves interprofessional collaboration with the patient's voice to provide timely and appropriate interventions. A missing thread (and latent opportunity) is the integration into the health system of the data contained in the multiplicity of personal wearable devices. The patient's personal data collection tools have the potential to add a valuable dimension to their health profile to further inform individualized health care plans. Nurse Leadership is central to accuracy of data collection. They require the capabilities to proactively undertake data-mining and predictive analytics. The data informs decisions regarding the flow of patients, the diversity of their needs in predictive workforce modelling, identifies cost drivers and informs the culture of workplace safety within a health care environment. The effectiveness of this work is impacted by the nurse leaders' cognitive capabilities (Helfat & Peteraf, 2015). The creation of safe work practices using data analytics informs the delivery of seamless patient care across multiple health and social agencies and environments. Collaborative and effective workplace cultures can be tracked and monitored to ensure best outcomes for patients. Nurse Leaders need to plan, resource and anticipate potential problems to better mitigate risk. This requires interprofessional collaboration in combining a process-focused orientation with an outcomes-focused orientation for individual patients that come into their care (Solman, 2016). Let us draw together some of the threads of the healthcare tapestry: the nursing profession is in a unique position to influence, lead and work with other professionals and patients to plan and inform the preferred future state of patient healthcare. Nursing leadership requires core capabilities to work in an interprofessional way across the healthcare continuum; contributing to and using big data sets and research to inform the needs of patients and their families. Forward planning for the predicted nursing workforce capabilities and workforce modelling required into the future will create a rich tapestry that reflects the complexity of the individual threads. It is time for us all to undertake a stocktake of how we can create the colourful tapestry needed for our workplaces to meet the needs of patients and the workforce into the future. A tapestry of threads is rich and diverse; requiring skill and capabilities to focus on building upon existing knowledge; planning for future essential knowledge and skills within the changing context of new technology and societal expectations. The context demands nurses with cognitive ability of interprofessional leadership moving away from professional silos to one of using professional judgement to continually identify, create and join the threads for effective patient centred care practices. At the same time it requires weaving in the necessary workplace culture of a highly skilled contemporary patient focused nursing workforce.","['nursing', 'leadership', 'challenges', 'opportunities']"
Digital Technologies in Everyday Life of the Russians,2021,"The development of innovations changes the usual living environment of people, affects their standard of living and lifestyle. The purpose of the article is to identify the main factors that determine the attitude of the Russians to innovations and contribute to their spread in everyday life. Findings based on the data of sample surveys, in particular the Comprehensive survey of living conditions of the population (2016), sample Federal statistical observation on the use of information technologies and information and telecommunication networks by the population (2018), and the materials of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) and the authors’ research conducted in 2017 in Moscow and the Moscow region. The authors used a set of methods for statistical data analysis. The application of the classification tree method revealed the main factors that influence the use of innovative technologies in everyday practice. Factor analysis was used to determine the specifics of Internet use by the Russians. The two-step cluster analysis procedure allowed to form two typology groups (clusters) of respondents depending on their use of such innovative practice as distance financial services. A positive attitude to innovation and information and communication technologies is determined by the experience of using modern technologies in the educational process, the age and interest (readiness) of respondents to use innovations and digital technologies in everyday life. The attitude to innovation is largely determined by the psychological characteristics of the respondent, their willingness to accept innovations. Although innovative practices such as tablet use and distance financial services are widely distributed, their prevalence is determined by similar factors. At the macro level, the parameters of the image and quality of life in various types of settlements, and the involvement in modern technologies in the workplace have an impact. The social and professional status of the person plays a more crucial role than the type of economic activity.","['digital', 'technologies', 'everyday', 'life', 'russians']"
Editorial,2015,"We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. [Henry David Thoreau, 1854] We see the 'dark side' of information technology (IT) use as a broad collection of 'negative' phenomena that are associated with the use of IT, and that have the potential to infringe the well-being of individuals, organisations and societies. Early understanding of the negative consequences of IT use focused on IT-mediated control of individuals in the workplace made possible by the automatic and electronic capture of information generated by tasks and activities (Zuboff, 1988), workflow rigidity caused by computer-integrated manufacturing systems (Corbett, 1987), decreased interpersonal interaction and social support from use of electronic performance monitoring systems (Carayon, 1993), psychological effects on individuals such as computer anxiety (Heinssen et al., 1987) and technical vulnerabilities such as Y2K. Other negative consequences studied were loss of privacy, intellectual piracy, identity theft, ergonomics-related injuries, automation-induced unemployment and software-related accidents (Kling, 1996). While this early understanding helped sensitise information systems (IS) and management researchers to the potentially negative impacts of IT use, current trends have dramatically increased the potential ambit, scope and intensity of dark side phenomena. Firstly, increasing reach (Keen, 1991) of IT enables use by people from a variety of demographic backgrounds and locations for work and non-work tasks, implying increased pervasiveness of IT-mediated activity. Secondly, increasing richness (Rayport & Sviokla, 1995) makes for IT products and applications that can be flexibly customised to individual user requirements through software components injected into hardware. Thirdly, increasingly user friendly, reliable and embedded IT is paving the way for its decentralised, un-guided and continuous use. One fall-out of these trends is that users experiment and improvise (Ciborra, 2002) in how they use system features. Such experimentation can have unexpected, designer-unintended and potentially negative consequences for the user and social unit where IT is being used. For example, the same software that is designed for testing network security and vulnerability by corporate IT or law enforcement departments can also be used for illegal network hacking and break-ins. Furthermore, it is not possible for system designers or users to anticipate and foresee all of these negative consequences (Markus & Mentzer, 2014). Another fall-out is that IT-mediated activities generate data that are easily stored, manipulated, analysed and accessed. Much of this data reside in the thin space between individuals' right to privacy and ownership and the collective's use of them for profit, surveillance and common-good activities; the possibilities for dark side phenomena abound. Recent studies have therefore examined a number of emerging phenomena associated with the negative consequences that may be experienced by individuals such as technostress, technology addiction, technology-induced interruptions, information overload and deviant IT-use behaviours by employees in organisations. In this special issue and as stated in its call-for-papers, we build on this stream to explore 'complex social and individual situations where the very benefits that the use of IT brings contain the seeds of potentially transformative negative changes in ways of working, collaborating and living - changes that can lead to non-beneficial, if unintended consequences'. Theories that have traditionally informed studies on the negative impacts of IT have included economic approaches to study labour-capital substitution and sociological approaches to understand IT-enabled control. In more recent studies, given the large scope and variety of emerging and potential dark side phenomena, we find the opportunity to examine theories from a number of disciplines in explaining negative impacts associated with the use of IT. In studies on technostress for instance, transaction and coping theories of stress from psychology (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) have been used to identify conditions pertaining to IT use that create chronic conditions of stress in the workplace and associated potential inhibiting mechanisms (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008) as well as the negative outcomes (e.g. Ayyagari et al., 2011). Meanwhile, moral disengagement theory has been used to explain coping mechanisms (D'Arcy et al., 2014), and social cognitive theories have been used to identify mechanisms for countering the effects of technostress (Tarafdar et al., 2015b). The concept of the panopticon (Bentham, 1787/1995) has been used to characterise the dark side of IT-based surveillance and control (Zuboff, 1988). Studies of technology addiction have been informed by theories of substance (Robinson & Berridge, 2003) and behavioural (Turel et al., 2011b) addiction and by the diagnostic and statistical manual criteria for problematic behaviours and addictions (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). For studying IT-induced interruptions and multitasking behaviours, distraction conflict theory (Baron, 1986) provides a theoretical perspective for understanding the distribution of attention between the primary task and interruption. A workflow and process-oriented approach to analysing IT-based interruptions enables identification of impacts on performance of critical tasks (Gupta et al., 2013a). We note here that 'dark side' is an over-arching term that includes several phenomena, some of which have been studied, many which have not and perhaps many more that have not yet been actuated. We suggest that it is useful at this stage, as guidance for future research, to identify salient themes according to which these phenomena can be classified. Looking forward, we develop a framework (Figure 1) that can be used as basis for future research on dark side phenomena. It describes four themes – context of their occurrence, negative outcomes, mitigation mechanisms and level of analysis. The first three themes characterise key aspects of dark side phenomena, and the fourth suggests that these aspects can be investigated at different levels of analysis. 'Context' refers to the specifics of a given situation in which IT is used or developed (Lee & Baskerville, 2003). Given the increasing variety of IT users and usage situations and given that those characteristics of IT that make it useful are also key enablers of dark side phenomena, dark side behaviours and outcomes depend on the context. Zimmermann et al., (2007) describes five elements of context that are salient in this respect, viz. individuality (e.g. individual characteristics and demographic groups), activity (e.g. task), location (e.g. spatial or physical setting), time (e.g. temporal characteristics) and relations (e.g. how different individuals are related). Firstly, to exemplify these contexts, individuals, depending on factors such as age and polychronicity (the natural tendency to engage in multi-tasking) (Conte & Gintoft, 2005), may have different propensities to suffer from dark side consequences of IT-based interruptions. Such findings convey the importance of tailored technology design and push technology designers away from the 'one technology fits all' paradigm. Secondly, in terms of tasks, as more organisational functions and units are expected to be involved in dark side phenomena (Tarafdar et al., 2015a), there is a need to understand the different activities where dark side phenomena can occur. Thirdly, in terms of location, the effects of phenomena such as interruptions and IT addiction have been studied in work and non-work contexts (Chen & Karahanna, 2014, Turel et al., 2011a). Increasingly, however, the use of IT takes place both continually, that is, not confined to a specific physical location and seamlessly across life-activities, that is, not easily classified as 'work' or 'non-work'. This is possibly more so for digital natives (Vodanovich et al., 2010). Future research should thus also examine dark side phenomenon in such 'virtual' milieus. Fourthly, it is possible that the effects of dark side phenomena are manifested differently over time. For example, while multitasking may lead to instant task accomplishment in the short term, it may cause productivity loss or poor health in the long term. Fifthly, consideration of how individuals are related provides the opportunity for understanding group level phenomena. For example, social media-enabled and rapid rumour spreading in times of natural and human-precipitated disasters can thwart public safety and rescue efforts; social networks and relationships become particularly potent during such incidents. Research focussing on scale development to assess dark side phenomena in various contexts would help in revealing their contextual nature. Dark side phenomena, by definition are associated with various negative outcomes. We see four aspects of negative outcomes: individual, organisation, industry and society. Outcomes for individuals have included those that are adverse workplace job and task-related (e.g. Gupta et al., 2013b, Selander & Henfridsson, 2012), problematic/deviant IT use-related (e.g. Turel et al., 2011b, D'Arcy et al., 2014) and work-life conflict-related (Turel et al., 2011a, Chen & Karahanna, 2014). Organisational outcomes studied have included reduced employee commitment, security breaches and employee turnover (Tarafdar et al., 2015a). There is potential for research that examines the impact of the individual's dark side cognitions and behaviours on organisational outcomes such as efficiency, productivity, reputation and financial performance. The mortgage and related financial services industry provides a good example for industry-related outcomes. Standardisation of IT applications used in the mortgage industry, while enabling process efficiencies through automated under-writing systems, might also have been associated with a decline in under-writing standards, and a focal point for co-evolving industry changes such as lender-concentration, increased sub-prime lending and easy/quick trading of mortgage-backed financial securities (Markus & Mentzer., 2014). These effects may have been major contributors to the 2008 global financial crisis. For instance, high-speed trading systems have been known to cause 'flash crashes': research (reported in Tracy & Patterson, 2014) shows that a key reason for these crashes is the use of super-fast, automated trading algorithms that obtain asymmetrically early access to price and policy information published by trading firms through high speed IT networks. During one such crash that occurred in May 2010, the Dow Jones index fell an unprecedented 1000 points in the space of a few minutes (Smith 2014), as $1 trillion was wiped off the value of markets; profits from such crashes often accrue to a miniscule percentage of those who participate in the stock markets. Studies of similar phenomena would be helpful in understanding industry-level dark side aspects. Although past research has examined societal impacts such as lack of work life balance (Ahuja et al. 2007), the area of dark side outcomes at the societal level remains largely unexplored. There is strong interest in examining the societal impacts of IT (Majchrzak et al., 2013). Taken together with the dark side imperative, there is thus particular interest and scope for research in this area. In terms of societies and nations, future research could focus on potential outcomes in terms of information exclusion (e.g. Castells 1996), disruptive patterns of work/living, Internet crime and pornography, identity theft and related issues, cyber-attacks and loss of privacy. Mitigation mechanisms are important because they can alleviate dark side phenomena and/or their negative outcomes (e.g. Nelson & Kletke., 1990). Pre-emptive mechanisms could be interventions that make a particular dark side phenomenon less likely to occur. They could be measures such as identifying and reducing the number of IS design features likely to cause stress, overload or addiction for instance, a fruitful area for future research. Another potentially fruitful area is the pre-emptive design of organisational policies regarding use of common applications such as email and social networks. Other mitigating mechanisms might be directed at the individual to alleviate his or her dark side behaviours and attitudes after they are manifested. These could include workplace mechanisms directed towards employees such as education/counselling, awareness, institutional support, job/role re-design and altered reporting structures. They could also comprise educational and social support at the level of the family and other social units, for creating awareness of IT addiction, cyberbullying, Internet pornography, privacy problems and intellectual property theft. While some mitigating mechanisms have been suggested (Tarafdar et al., 2015a), research in this area is relatively sparse. We also see legal, civic and political policies as powerful mitigation mechanisms. Similar to policies on health, we are now seeing the wide-scale deployment of policies-shaping IT use activities such as checking email (Stuart 2014). National policies that are relevant for dark side IT phenomena may include, for instance, restricting access to potentially harmful or dangerous websites (for instance, child pornography) (Quayle & Taylor, 2002), ensuring cyber-security (Givens & Busch, 2013) and developing appropriate industry-specific regulations such as in the financial sector. It is important to study the level of analysis of dark side phenomena because IT use causes changes in the work and lives of individuals, organisations and other social collectives. Much of the recent research cited in this editorial introduction has focussed on the individual level of analysis in terms of the individual's experience and behaviour regarding dark side phenomena. Associated outcomes such as impaired task performance and negative job attitudes have also been examined at the individual level (e.g. Tarafdar et al., 2015b). However, these individual-level effects can also have repercussions in teams, families and organisations. For example IT addiction can increase conflicts between family members and the intention to switch jobs (Turel et al., 2011a) while misuse of IT or non-compliance with organisational security policies may have financial-related or reputation-related organisational implications. Equally, individual level variables such as misuse can be affected by organisational level variables such as leadership, culture or IT use policies (D'Arcy et al., 2009) or national/societal level variables such as general work-culture and government policies (Xu et al., 2012). Thus, we call for attention to levels of analysis other than the individual and to cross-level effects, i.e., when predictors at one level influence outcomes at a different level. Furthermore, a particular dark side phenomenon may exhibit a temporal progression from one level to another or within the same level. For instance, prolonged misuse of IT by individuals, if unchecked, might eventually lead to loss of sensitive organisational data, or prolonged exposure to techno-stressors might lead to negative impacts on health. Accordingly, appropriate policies at national and organisational levels may lead, over time, to reducing the frequency of occurrence of dark side phenomena, as has been seen in the case of temporal impacts of government policies on smoking and drinking (e.g. Ponicki et al., 2007). Thus, longitudinal studies tracing particular phenomena over time and across levels represent another fruitful avenue for research. Dark side phenomena can be studied using the qualitative and quantitative approaches typically employed in IS research. In addition, given that the negative consequences of IT use are largely unintended and unforeseen by designers, the use of future-oriented approaches such as scenario planning (Markus & Mentzer, 2014) can provide foresight about possible system uses and thus sensitises IS designers to the proactive anticipation of potential dark side effects from their use. Furthermore, design approaches that can offer persuasive support at the moment of use (Fogg, 2002) or utilise concepts such as value-based design (Schwartz, 1994) could be used to design IS for minimising dark side effects. For instance, one may examine how interventions at the moment of use might lead to better interruption/overload handling, multi-tasking or overuse management. Experimental designs that capture IT use in meaningfully simulated environments have the potential to reveal dark side use behaviours. In response to our call for papers for the special issue on the dark side of IT in the Information Systems Journal, we received a large number of manuscripts, each of which went through the journal's peer review process consisting of reviewers' comments and editorial feedback from the associate editors and guest editors of this special issue. The final set of papers went through two or three rounds of review and revisions. We are deeply grateful to the associate editors and reviewers, who put in many hours of work in order to help the authors of the papers we present here, improve their works. This special issue would not be possible without their commitment, dedication and hard work. We thank the journal's editors for their support with this special issue. In this first part of the special issue, we present a collection of four papers that report on studies on familiar and new dark side phenomena, conducted in different contexts and associated with different negative consequences. We characterise the papers using the framework developed in this editorial. We note here that most of these papers address the individual level of analysis and do not address mitigation mechanisms. This is a representative of the total set of papers that were initially submitted; these 'missing' themes point to areas we see as being important to future research. The paper 'Illuminating the Underground: The Reality of Unauthorised File Sharing' by Beekhuyzen, J., von Hellens, L. and Nielse. S. explores a relatively unexamined type of online community, namely one that focuses on the illegal sharing of music files. This is perhaps not a new dark-side phenomenon, but the IS literature is relatively silent about it. In this study, the authors contribute by theoretically developing this context, explaining the nature and formation processes of such communities and systematically exploring the reasons for engaging in such illicit behaviours. The overarching theoretical perspective is actor network theory. The study's findings, based on qualitative data, describe negative outcomes at multiple levels and indicate that people engage in such illicit behaviours because the resources they seek are scarce in traditional markets. The context for the study is an online community focused on the free and unauthorised sharing of music files. Negative outcomes include, for individuals, possible legal actions that can result in fines and gaol time, for online communities, legal action and dismantlement, for the music industry and financial damages. The phenomenon is analysed at the level of individual participants, the online community and music industry. Given the growth of illegal file sharing and associated problems, this paper presents a topical issue. The paper, 'Leveraging fairness and reactance theories to deter reactive computer abuse: An empirical study of the influence of counterfactual reasoning and organizational trust', by Lowry, P., Posey, C., Bennett, R. and Roberts, T. uses fairness and reactance theories to explain security-related reactions to unfair events that result in reactive computer abuse. This study explains how factors such as explanation adequacy, trust, age, organisational security awareness, training and education and computer use at work could influence the formation of a dark side phenomenon such as computer abuse. It emphasises how certain training and security programmes could result in negative outcomes for the organisation if employees are ignored. The context for the study is employees' use of IT in organisations from the banking, financial and insurance sectors in the USA. The data are quantitative, from a survey administered to working professionals. Negative outcomes relate to abuse of computers detrimental to the organisation analysed at the level of individual behaviour. This study could lead to initial work on integrating other theories such as justice theory to understand employees' reactive computer abuse. The paper, 'The Effects of Technostress and Switching-stress on Discontinued Use of Social Networking Services: A Study of Facebook Use', by Maier, C., Laumer, S., Weinert, C. and Wetzel, T. examines technostress in the context of switching from one social network application to another. It extends the literature by conceptually developing the association between technostress and IT use discontinuance and by developing the concept of switching stress creators, that is, the stress caused by switching from one application to another. It also focuses on system use termination, which few studies have addressed so far and thus also extends the literature on adoption and usage phases of the IS life cycle. The context for the study is individuals' use of a social networking application (Facebook) in a non-work context. The data are longitudinal, collected through surveys, interviews, diaries and experiments at different points in time. Negative outcomes include exhaustion from social-network stress and switching stress experienced by the user and discontinued use of the application for the commercial application provider. The paper, 'The Many Faces of IT Interruptions: A Taxonomy and Preliminary Investigation of Their Performance Effects studies', by Shamel and Pinsonneault examines the effects of IT interruptions on productivity and develops a taxonomy of interruptions using data from qualitative log diaries of 14 participants and 21 qualitative interviews. The process of analysis leads the authors to define new categories of interruptions based on message content. The context for the study is individuals working on real, interdependent tasks within a larger project in an interruptive organisational work environment. Negative outcomes include interruptions and reduced task performance for individuals. The level of analysis is the individual's handling of interruptions. The study extends the IS literature on interruptions by suggesting that hybrid interruptions are neither completely relevant nor irrelevant to the task at hand. It adds to existing understanding of different interruption types and how they impact performance. Research on the dark side of IT use can form an important bulwark of study in the IS field by reinforcing conceptual and critical richness in our research and by providing a backdrop for mindful and thoughtful use of IT in its implications for impact and practice. Are we making a better world with ICT's? (Walsham, 2012); the theme of the 2014 International Conference on Information Systems was 'Building a Better World through Information Systems'. The railroad need not ride on us. We hope that this special issue will advance research on how various aspects of the dark side of IT use can be identified and countered, and that it will serve as a guide and call to increase research in this area.",['editorial']

Digitalization of employment relations: world experience and its implementation in Ukraine,2021,"European and local practices of digitization and their impact on employment relations, determination of current directions of digitalization development in Ukraine and implementation of the best world solutions are studied. It is pointed out that COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the role and perception of digitalization in society and the economy. It is noted that digital technologies are now necessary for work, study, entertainment, communication, shopping and access to everything from health services to culture. The digital transformation has opened up new opportunities for the creation of new enterprises, the emergence of new forms of digital employment. It is noted that in early 2018 Ukraine officially embarked on the path of digitalization and policy making in the digital segment. The Concept of Digital Economy of Ukraine and Social Development for 2018–2020 has been adopted, which contains the main goals and principles of digital development in the country, as well as plans for their implementation. As a result of digitalization, modern technology makes it to perform job functions outside the workplace, not only at home (home office), but anywhere (mobile office) in many areas of the economy. Due to the possibility of remote earning, on June 25, 2019, the Ministry of Social Policy published the bill «On amendments to the Labor Code of Ukraine (concerning flexible forms of labor organization)». It is proposed, in Art. 24 of the Labor Code in particular, to clarify that the compliance with the written form is mandatory when signing an employment agreement for remote work. The indicators of the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), which demonstrates the level of digital efficiency of Europe and monitors the progress of the European Union in this direction are summarized. In order to implement the influence of digitalization on employment relations in Ukraine, the experience of a number of European countries (Spain, France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries) is studied and analyzed. It is concluded that the influence of modern digital technologies significantly changes the state of the labor market, the demand for certain specialists, and the conditions of remote employment. The wages and social security are transformed and become individualized. Employees' dependence on employers is decreasing, their work is shifting into the digital space, which requires constant acquiring of new knowledge and skills in working with modern technologies.","['digitalization', 'employment', 'relations:', 'world', 'experience', 'implementation', 'ukraine']"
The Invention of the Future. Does Platformisationn Redefine the Notion of the Firm?,2018,"New forms of labour intermediation through digital platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo or Amazon Mechanical Turk can be conceptualised as the latest stage of a long-lasting process of disaggregation of the firm and “disorganisation of labour law.” In particular, the rise of platform-mediated work can be seen as an instantiation of deliberate business strategies aimed at outsourcing labour while retaining intense and pervasive managerial prerogative. The phenomenon is exacerbating several unresolved tensions inherent in the contemporary world of work, let alone the perverse impact that “platformisation” is having on precariousness and social inequalities.In short, new technologies allow platforms to abandon traditional methods of workplace governance and adopt a stronger version of the “command and control” logic. Direct interaction is replaced by a significant reliance on information communications technology: workers are monitored more closely and intimately than they ever used to be by means of tech tools, including algorithms, artificial intelligence and customers’ reviews. This leads to the question whether the existing concept of “firm” is appropriate to face this transformational new reality, whether minor or major adaptations may be necessary or whether we need a total re-invention of the underlying assumptions of the employment relationship.After describing the theoretical antecedents of hierarchical outsourcing, the article explores the literature on the nature of “non-standard forms of firm” by applying transaction-cost economics. In an attempt to update the incomplete trichotomy among “hierarchies,” “markets” and “networks,” I present a complementary model combining pre-existing schemes. By building on theories unfolding the disarticulation of the formal employing entity and the pulverisation of work-related responsibilities, this paper demystifies the prototypical business model of rampant socio-economic actors.","['invention', 'future.', 'does', 'platformisationn', 'redefine', 'notion', 'firm?']"
Control and Flexibility: The Use of Wearable Devices in Capital- and Labor-Intensive Work Processes,2024,"The use of wearables in the workplace allows for close monitoring of work processes and might also have consequences for work content and skill requirements. Past research has emphasized the detrimental effects of wearables, particularly those caused by the standardization of work and monitoring of workers. By contrast, this study asks under what conditions the implementation of wearables as part of digital assistance systems is beneficial for workers. Based on recent contributions in the field of labor process theory, this study analyzes the implementation of new technologies using the concepts of the regulatory regime, organizational first-order factors, and workplace second-order choices. The analysis is based on findings from 48 interviews with 83 interviewees in 16 German manufacturing workplaces along with making site visits. It examines the implementation of wearables and the impacts on work content, skills, working conditions, and employment. Besides showing how labor agency affects the implementation of new technologies, the particular contribution of this study lies in analyzing the differences in the implementation of wearables in capital- and labor-intensive organizations. While standardization of work and reduction of work content prevailed in labor-intensive processes, capital-intensive processes were most often characterized by the extension of skill requirements and the risk of work intensification.","['control', 'flexibility:', 'wearable', 'devices', 'capital-', 'labor-intensive', 'work', 'processes']"
The changing nature of work in the 21st century as a social determinant of mental health,2024,"An extensive literature has documented the association of psychosocial work stressors – e.g., job strain, effort-reward imbalance, organizational injustice, long working hours, job insecurity, shift work, workplace harassment and bullying – with mental health problems1-4. However, the implications for population mental health of the changing nature of work in the 21st century have not been sufficiently highlighted. The classical job strain model captures job task-related exposures (e.g., the combination of excessive psychological demands with lack of autonomy), but does not speak to the broader picture of what has been happening in the workplace during the era of globalization, automation, and the rise of alternate forms of work (e.g., casual and part-time work). Three trends are exemplary in this respect: digital enforcement, just-in-time scheduling, and workplace fissuring. Each of these trends represents a potential social determinant of mental health at the population level. Digital surveillance has become widespread across workplaces in some countries, whether in the form of tracking devices worn by employees in Amazon warehouses (""fulfillment centers"") to meet their daily quotas, or the monitoring software installed on the desktop computers of remote employees during the pandemic. One of the most intensely surveilled occupations in the US is trucking, which employs about 3 million drivers. Truck drivers are already at high risk of mental health problems, due to the excessive hours of work, lack of sleep, and social isolation5. Since the deregulation of the US trucking industry in the 1980s, they have also had to contend with the burden of low wages, due to a shift in compensation from salaried work to piece rate compensation. Truck drivers are paid for miles driven, not for the hours they spend on the road stuck in congested traffic or the hours waiting for their cargo to be loaded/unloaded. As a result of the switch to piece rate compensation, truckers' wages dropped by 44% between 1977 and 19955. In order to make a living, drivers have been forced to spend longer hours on the road, which increases the risk of accidents. In response, lawmakers in 1997 mandated the installation of electronic logging devices on all trucks. These devices have helped to enforce ""hours of service"" regulations in the trucking industry, which dictate that truckers may drive no more than eleven hours a day, after which they must take a mandatory rest break. However, despite the industry-wide improvement in compliance with hours of service limits, the introduction of digital enforcement paradoxically increased the rate of crashes, because drivers responded by speeding to make up for lost productivity6. In terms of worker autonomy, the same time-logging devices are bundled with other capabilities which enable employers to monitor driver performance in areas such as fuel usage, frequency of changing lanes, and adherence to travel routes. This has nothing to do with compliance with safety regulations, but is all about extracting efficiency and maximizing productivity. The concept of just-in-time scheduling originally began as a management strategy in the manufacturing sector to align the delivery of raw-material supplies with production schedules. Subsequently it spread to the retail and service industry, where employers use it to manage labor costs by scheduling employees based on fluctuating consumer demand. For example, if a store manager believes that his/her shop will be unusually busy ahead of a national holiday, he/she can update scheduling on the fly and ask additional employees to come in. Under just-in-time scheduling, workers typically receive their schedules on short notice, and may have their shifts changed or canceled at the last minute. Employers may put workers on call with no guarantee that there will be work available for them. According to the American Time Use Survey, an estimated 45% of wage and salary workers over the age of 15 are given their schedules less than a month in advance, while 20% are told about their schedules less than one week in advance7. In addition to making it difficult to arrange childcare, attend school, or hold a second job, irregular work hours also result in income volatility for hourly wage workers. Variable work hours in turn jeopardize access to many safety net programs (e.g., food assistance programs in the US) which require a minimum number of hours of work per week. A study in South Korea found that workers with unpredictable work hours had a significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms8. A third example of the changing nature of work is workplace fissuring, which refers to the management practice of outsourcing parts of the organization which are not viewed as ""core competencies"" of the firm9. For example, most cleaners, laundry workers and kitchen staff in the hotel industry are not employees of the brand-name hotels, but are ""independent contractors"" hired by third party companies. Customer service departments of major corporations have been spun off to third party companies, which in turn hire an army of independent contractors to perform the work. The independent contractor is responsible for purchasing the assets required to perform the work (home office equipment such as a computer, headsets and a dedicated phoneline), and must pay for the costs of training to become a customer service representative for the brand name corporation, as well as pay a monthly fee to use the digital platform that connects him/her to customers. At the same time, the independent contractor classification means that the worker receives none of the benefits of being a salaried employee, such as a pension or health insurance. These workers are typically paid for the time they spend responding to customer calls, not for the hours waiting for customers to call in. An estimated 1 in 5 people in the US workforce are engaged in the fissured workforce – including hotel and hospitality, telephone operators, home health care, janitors, security guards, and fast food restaurants. The consideration of working conditions as a social determinant opens up the possibility for an expanded set of structural interventions to promote population mental health, e.g., changing laws to protect the rights, welfare and safety of employees. It forces the question: what is the role of corporations and employers in generating mental ill-health, and what is the potential for work-based interventions, policies and regulations to promote mental health? Businesses (and shareholders) profit from wringing maximum productivity out of workers through low pay, long work hours, unpredictable schedules, digital surveillance, and shifting the costs of doing business on to workers. Consumers also benefit from lower prices, but, in many cases, consumers are also workers being exploited by the same system. It is time for us to consider the changing nature of work in the 21st century as a significant social determinant of mental health, and to make a substantial effort to develop interventions addressing it.","['changing', 'nature', 'work', '21st', 'century', 'social', 'determinant', 'mental', 'health']"
digitala arbetslivet,2023,"The virtual workplace&#x0D; This article examines what the digitalization of healthcare has come to mean for nurses as a professional group. Digitalization is understood in the article as a term that is concerned with everything from digital surveillance systems that partially take over the nurses’ attentive observation of their patients, to healthcare meetings that do not take place in the hospital but transpire with the help of cameras and monitors. Another dimension of digitalization is that which goes beyond healthcare meetings and concerns digital journal systems and how they change working life from writing on paper by hand to having all the care of the patient visible on a computer screen. The purpose of the article is therefore to culturally analyse and examine how the working life of nurses change when healthcare and medical care are digitized. What happens when digital technology enters the profession and when working nurses have to spend an increasing amount of time in a liaison with / association with the virtual environment?&#x0D; Four nurses, aged 46 years and over were interviewed based on a questionnaire with open questions. Based on the interviews, this article presents four key themes, namely (1) the actual digitalization of health and medical care and how it affects the nurses; (2) patients who via the Internet can be more apprised of their illness and treatment options and thus can also affect healthcare meetings in new ways, (3) the different contexts of digital technologies that are at risk of collapsing into each other and allowing the patient's private attitude/approach to come to the attention of the nurses, and (4) how the boundary between working life and leisure time is affected by the new technology.&#x0D; Digital technology thus creates various mediated platforms that transform the interactions in, for example, a healthcare meeting. These interactions can occur both in the virtual world as well as in face-to-face relationships in a healthcare meeting. It has been central to the article's argumentation to reveal how the impact can go both ways and that this fact affects nurses working life in new and unexpected ways. Based on this reasoning, the article also argues for ethnological work life research that focuses much more on the complexity that working individuals meet, both in their profession and in spare time. There is not always a clear boundary between these two worlds. If anything, ethnological research into working life has highlighted the importance of focusing on the entire life situation of the workforce; this is something which it is even more central to make evident in relation to the digitalized working life.","['digitala', 'arbetslivet']"
Algorithmic Exploitation: Understanding Labor Process and Control among RideHailing Platform Workers,2022,"This study analyzes the labor process of ride-hailing workers and the platformcompany’s control over them. This research employs Labour Process Theory (LPT)to examine the labor process and control critically. Based on in-depth interviewswith motorcycle drivers working for Go-Jek and Grab between June 2020 and June2021 in Yogyakarta, Kediri, and Jakarta, this research found that labor or workersare transformed into a commodity where job supply and demand are confounded andmediated by digital platforms. Algorithmic management, utilized in this industry, playsa significant role in this digital industry, including its use as a point of production and asa mechanism of control and monitoring in the workplace. The use of feedback systems,ratings, and platform ratings as a consequence of emotional work is used by managersto help monitor their employees. Furthermore, this study reveals that the form of controlconducted by the platform represents an unequal power relation, which producesdissatisfaction and conflicts. We argue that the labor process in this job resembles whatwe coined “algorithmic exploitation,” which means that the platform companies aredeliberately using technology and obscuring the control process over the operations ofthe workers to instill the high standards of service, while the workers are trapped in avery weak employment status as “partners.”","['algorithmic', 'exploitation:', 'understanding', 'labor', 'process', 'control', 'among', 'ridehailing', 'platform', 'workers']"

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITALIZATION OF SOCIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS,2023,"The article considers the main directions of labor force development in the conditions of digitalization of social and labor relations. The author defines the trends and prospects of the formation of labor legislation aimed at protecting vulnerable categories of the workforce. The current stage of labor force development in the domestic labor market is characterized by the complex nature of socio-economic relations, the lack of stable dynamics of sustainable economic growth and the increasing problems inherent in the economy under the regime of restrictions. Currently, the formation of labor legislation is continuing, the need for transformation of which was identified in the previous three years in connection with the problems that arose in companies in connection with the spread of ""remote"" and flexible formats of interaction between employer and employee and the digitalization of the Russian sectors of the economy. In this regard, there is an urgent need at the legislative level to streamline the regulation of the labor regime when transferring employees to a remote work format, coordination of tasks on the part of management, and monitoring of the activities of the workforce has become relevant. The purpose of this work is to identify the factors influencing the development of the workforce in modern conditions of transition to digital technologies. It is concluded that the digitalization of social and labor relations is a complex process, accompanied by the need to equip workplaces with modern digital equipment and train employees in digital literacy skills. Today, the demand for specialists with new digital skills in the domestic labor market is limited, workers of traditional professions are required, and the share of future industries in the Russian economy is still extremely small.","['workforce', 'development', 'context', 'digitalization', 'social', 'labor', 'relations']"
Working against the clock: digital surveillance in US Medicaid homecare services,2024,"This article explores the implementation of a digital verification system known as Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) across homecare services for older and disabled adults within the US Medicaid program. EVV systems are used to conduct daily check-ins through GPS tracking and biometric identity verification. While touted as a means to identify and deter “fraud, waste, and abuse,” the digital monitoring also generates detailed data trails on the lives and habits of service recipients, as well as constraining their daily movements. Drawing on qualitative interviews with workers and clients, I argue that this case study calls attention to how harms from digitalization of social welfare provision emerge from workplace surveillance and labor management, and how EVV becomes a tool for more finely tuning classifications of different types of paid and unpaid care. The burdensome digital compliance hurdles reinforced older employment tensions between the state, care workers, and public benefits recipients.","['working', 'against', 'clock:', 'digital', 'surveillance', 'medicaid', 'homecare', 'services']"
The Risks of Wearable Technologies to Individuals and Organizations,2016,"Advancements in wearable and integrated sensing devices have given tremendous opportunities to enable advanced remote applications including sensing, monitoring, and tracking systems and states. Accordingly, wearable systems can be utilized to provide social and economic well-being for individuals by assisting them in the performance of their daily duties and for organizations by keeping their employees anytime, anywhere connected and by enhancing their productivity. However, wearable devices are, mainly, wireless in nature, which make them exposed to several types of security attacks that may threaten the life of individuals and the security of organizations.

Accordingly, wearable systems can be utilized to provide social and economic well-being for individuals by assisting them in the performance of their daily duties and for organizations by keeping their employees anytime, anywhere connected and by enhancing their productivity. However, wearable devices are, mainly, wireless in nature, which make them exposed to several types of security attacks that may threaten the life of individuals and the security of organizations. This chapter brings a comprehensive study on the benefits of wearable technologies and their related security and privacy issues, discusses the major policies that can be used to mitigate the risk posed by wearable technologies and the proposed techniques to assist users' safety in hazardous workplaces; and discusses the digital investigation of security incidents on wearable technologies.","['risks', 'wearable', 'technologies', 'individuals', 'organizations']"
At the Digital Doorstep: How Customers Use Doorbell Cameras to Manage Delivery Workers,2022,"At the Digital Doorstep examines the consequences of two overlapping trends: first is the growing “gigification” of delivery work, accompanying the recent rise of e-commerce; second is the increasing popularity of networked doorbell cameras. By analyzing interviews with both delivery drivers and users of doorbell cameras, this report argues that while doorbell cameras are heavily marketed and described as tools for safety and security in the home, they are also near-constant tools of workplace surveillance for delivery workers. We identify a pattern of “boss behavior,” where doorbell camera users take on actions expected of employers, using this technology to monitor, instruct, and punish delivery workers.The rise of boss behavior is occurring at the same time as the growth of platform-based delivery work, which deploys the now-familiar techniques of algorithmic management to direct a rolling population of ad hoc workers, scheduled at irregular hours on unpredictable routes with precarious job security and little to no federal labor protections. The risks of this work and the challenges of algorithmic management are sharpened by the increased use of doorbell cameras, which provide the possibility of an unseen and unknown audience at the doorstep. Workers often choose to perform various forms of retail service niceties while weighing customer satisfaction against delivery quotas in the apps that manage their employment.In addition to addressing the misclassification of platform-based delivery workers, we argue that the growth of networked doorbell cameras is also a crucial topic for labor advocates. The debates over privacy and surveillance more generally should consider the very real consequences this technology has on the working conditions of an already precarious workforce.","['digital', 'doorstep:', 'customers', 'doorbell', 'cameras', 'manage', 'delivery', 'workers']"
How Health Relationship Management Services (HRMS) Benefits Corporate Wellness,2016,"The typical worker spends about 47 hours a week commuting sitting in cars, trains, buses, or sitting at their desks.These statistics show that maintaining a healthy work and life balance has become progressively important.Workplace wellness and health promotion are of central importance for any organization in today's world.People are becoming highly conscious about their health and seek to ensure that they are provided with best medical services and facilities in case of any health issue.Organizations have switched to proactive strategies for the healthcare of their employees.Billions of dollars are spent on the workforce only after illnesses or injuries have occurred.Over the past several decades, healthcare services have drastically changed, altering the manner in which healthcare was previously managed.Technological advancements in medical systems have revolutionized the healthcare industry, and digital health tracking has been quite successful in monitoring patients' health.Since patients are continuously monitored, no matter where they are, these systems can indicate patients' adherence to medical protocols and act as a warning sign for such diseases as heart problems, Alzheimer's disease, and many others.Health Relationship Management Services (HRMS) is a new paradigm which defines comprehensive healthcare for an individual.HRMS is a complete health ecosystem suitable for the workplace, which enables healthcare providers to collect personal health data from various sources, analyze it for positive outcomes, and take action to preserve an employee's good health to reduce absenteeism or turnover.HRMS can act as a preventative sentinel for corporate well-being as well.(","['health', 'relationship', 'management', 'services', '(hrms)', 'benefits', 'corporate', 'wellness']"
Reducing disruptions caused by social networking sites through mindfulness,2020,"In the present era, everyone is connected with digital devices in their workplaces. Individuals from all facets of life, including employees, are interconnected through their digital devices. The use of new technology increases workers' efficiency and output, but at the same time, technology can interrupt their productivity. Likewise, interruptions in work environments include emails, social networking site (SNS) notifications, and colleagues. Individuals become unstable and fail to meet standards and are incapable of monitoring their actions when lack of self-regulation occurs. Mindfulness facilitates self-regulation of sustained attention and non-elaborative processing. This chapter focuses on employees' use of social networking sites during office hours. Employees' face interruptions by using social networking sites during office hours. This type of interruption affects the employee's job performance and wellbeing. In this scenario mindfulness plays an important role to mitigate the interruptions caused by social network use. Self-regulation perspective is used to understand the role of mindfulness as an affective technique to solve this issue. In the end, an experiment is discussed to relate the role of mindfulness as an intervention to deal with these interruptions. A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test research design was used by focusing on self-regulation perspective. ""Mindfulness"" was used as an intervention to mitigate the interruptions caused by SNSs. It was concluded that mindfulness meditation is helpful to reduce the distractions and interruption effects in employees. Employers and organizations need to consider this intervention plan to increase employees' job performance.","['reducing', 'disruptions', 'caused', 'social', 'networking', 'sites', 'through', 'mindfulness']"
INDUSTRY 4.0 APPLICATIONS AND DIGITILIZATION OF LEAN PRODUCTION LINES,2018,"European economy faces two main problems in manufacturing sector: inefficient production with high costs and long time to supply new products to market. With these obstacles, economies cannot compete with other developing countries like China. In order to overcome these problems, leading firms works on new paradigms like lean production, digitilization and industry 4.0. Firms could simplify production lines by dealing with all the wastes, delays, faults etc. through the workplace. So they can shorten the production cycle times, data entry time, waiting semi-finished products, faults and scraps in the production lines. Industry 4.0 applications helps lean manufacturing lines to realize more efficient and quality production sytems. Because, these applications will make the European economy grow increasing productivity and added value of the products. In today’s industry digitization is vital for manufacturing processes. Especially in automotive supplier industry getting data from the machines and production lines by digital panels and monitors is vital for efficient production. Rim industry is one of the suppliers of automotive manufacturers. In order to provide quality and high performance products in time, rim producers try to apply lean manufacturing systems and industry 4.0 applications to their production lines. Jantsa is one of the biggest rim producer of Turkey with 200 diffrent sizes and over 3,000 different designs and models. The factory is located on 95,000 square meters area with the production capacity of nearly1,900,000 wheels annually. They expert 75 % of these wheels to over 80 countries worldwide. The digitilization project realized in Jantsa aims to get information about the rim production lines and make necessary improvements in order to increase efficiency. The name of the project is Production Data Collection and Barcoded Product Tracking Automation. OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculation method is used in order to digitilize production lines in lean systems for improving processes. According to test data we have three factors effecting OEE calculation: availability, performance and quality. When we make the calculation the test results of OEE is 93.1%. It is fairly high according to international production standards. The focus should be on increasing the performance of machines and equipment used in the operation.","['industry', 'applications', 'digitilization', 'lean', 'production', 'lines']"
Innovative Approach for Monitoring Underground Excavations at San Xavier Underground Mine Laboratory,2023,"ABSTRACT Assessing and making decisions in underground mines is crucial and is difficult due to the harsh environment and the limitation of accessibility. Monitoring plays an important role in assessing ground conditions to ensure safety and efficiency. Through consistent monitoring, a safe interoperable underground mine can be achieved, but to ensure coherent and valid monitoring, there are factors that need to be considered. The approach taken for monitoring with technologies used in it can highly impact the safety, productivity, and understanding of ground conditions. Visualizations designed with principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), can improve knowledge, and aid situational awareness. Focusing on monitoring systems and interfaces that are user-friendly and reliable can help improve overall underground conditions. This paper proposes a monitoring framework that uses desktop and Virtual Reality (VR) to display rock movement in the San Xavier (SX) Underground Mine Laboratory through a digital twin. INTRODUCTION Continuous monitoring is required to enhance assessment and situational awareness (SA) in engineering projects such as mining. Monitoring creates a safer workplace, ensuring efficient and continuous production that meets production and profit goals. An optimal monitoring system for large-scale projects would be a system understood by different subject matter experts with varying levels of expertise. Continuous and efficient monitoring plays a foundational role in harsh and uncertain underground mine conditions. The data obtained from monitoring the rock mass in underground mine operations improves decision-making process, enhances the understanding of the current state of the mine, and helps make predictions. With the overwhelming flow of data, there is a higher possibility of having false positives and uninformative data representation, leading to serious cognitive burden (Zhou et al., 2017). The display of data and information and monitoring network design is crucial to overcoming cognitive burden. A monitoring system that emphasizes user-friendly methods, such as visual analytics (VA), would help engineers and workers gain insight from large and complex data sets resulting in enhanced overall SA (Zhou et al., 2017). Having a monitoring system that considers the display of information at an underground mine could secure the safety of the workers and minimize risks, help to plan better designs, and evaluate current designs, and improve the advancement at the mine.","['innovative', 'approach', 'monitoring', 'underground', 'excavations', 'xavier', 'underground', 'mine', 'laboratory']"

Towards a digitalized collaborative zakat management system for accelerating good governance practices in the new normal,2021,"Many countries around the world are slowly beginning to move from managing the COVID-19 crisis to recovery and reopening of economies. In Malaysia, the government has launched various initiatives with the main aim to empower people, propel business and stimulate the economy. However, the socio-economic shock brought by COVID-19 pandemic is of the magnitude that the world has not experienced in decades. Hence, government alone cannot address the enormous challenge without collaborating with the diverse and inclusive stakeholders. As one of the collaborators, zakat institution is well positioned to play a significant role in this transformation. However, in meeting the demand for this role, zakat institutions need to adapt to the major shifts in many aspects of the pre pandemic way of doing things. One significant shift started at the beginning of the pandemic in Malaysia where many industries experience sharp increase in the adoption of digital channels. This is expected to accelerate and moving forward the government is providing help in moving towards more comprehensive adoption of digitalization. Given the current scenario, this paper proposes a model based on digitalization of collaborative zakat management for Pusat Pungutan Zakat, Wilayah Persekutuan (PPZ-MAIWP). The model provides a starting point in understanding the capability required to move towards more comprehensive digitalization of services provided by PPZ-MAIWP. The digitalization model is based on a collaborative effort between PPZ-MAIWP and other organisations in distributing zakat for empowerment initiatives. Using a developed impact assessment prototype system, this paper will provide a simulation results where PPZ-MAWIP will be able to short list organisations based on accumulated highest score received for the following components: governance structures, capability to deliver initiatives effectively and clarity of targeted socio-economic impact. Once the organisations are short listed, PPZ will then call for an online meeting with the selected organisations before making the final decision. The use of the digital model allows PPZ-MAIWP to make decisions faster, more objective and adapt to remote workplace. In addition, the selection criteria can also be used subsequently by PPZ-MAIWP to monitor the progress of the initiatives and also for the selected organisations to report on their progress. This forms part of the risk management process and in turn enhances effective delivery of sustainable empowerment initiatives funded by zakat fund. It is also an important mechanism to facilitate timely reporting on the social economic impact delivered that is crucial in enhancing stakeholders’ engagement and trust. Hence, this system accelerates good governance practices throughout the zakat distribution ecosystem. The model and the simulation presented can also act as a starting point in operationalisation of more comprehensive digitalization by PPZ in the new normal. Overall, the new normal provides substantial opportunities for PPZ to accelerate adoption of digitalization and good governance practices throughout the zakat ecosystem.","['towards', 'digitalized', 'collaborative', 'zakat', 'management', 'system', 'accelerating', 'good', 'governance', 'practices', 'normal']"
Monitoring trends in psychosocial and physical working conditions: Challenges and suggestions for the 21st century,2021,"In work and health research, there is a lack of studies on prevalence of psychosocial (eg, quantitative demands, social relations) and physical (eg, physical activity, heavy lifting) working conditions among national employee populations – and their trends. [In the following, I shall not discuss the issue of trends of other exposures, such as chemical and dust exposures (1).] To my knowledge, in the recent decade, only a few studies have investigated this topic (2–8), and, in this issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health , such a rare study is published (9). Trends This issue of the journal includes a new Swedish study, which not only aims to distinguish between different types of macro trends in working conditions (going beyond the assumption of simple linear trends) but also examines whether the gap between good and bad – in terms of working environment – jobs has widened. The reason why it makes sense to go beyond trends in working conditions is obvious. Regarding the industrialized countries, some findings indicate that working conditions are largely deteriorating (3, 5, 8). Other findings indicate that inequalities in distributions of working conditions are increasing (10, 11). A third group of findings suggest that no uniform trends exist; trends, if any, are different from country to country (7) . It has been suggested that the reason for these trends (deterioriation of or increased inequality in exposure to working conditions) might be found in the last four decades of liberalization of labor markets accompanied by globalization and digitalization (10–12). Corin et al`s study (9) in this issue of the journal, however, neither shows a downward uniform trend nor an increased inequality in quality of working conditions in Sweden. However, the question remains, if monitoring data in other countries were analyzed in the same manner as in this new Swedish study, what trends would we see in these countries? Reasons for lack of scientific research focus One can wonder why there are comparably few studies on trends in working conditions. In his first edition of Modern Epidemiology, Rothman claims that researchers of health risk factors tend to jump directly to advanced regression analyses skipping a thorough inspection of their data, including which groups in the analysed population are exposed to what exposures (13). Simple intercorrelation tables, or even the traditional 'Table 1' showing independent variables broken down by gender or socioeconomic status might be insufficient. Regarding a range of work environment factors, prevalences by occupation can give rich information on what a given exposure actually means for the worker. Let me just give an example from Denmark, a labor market with working hour restrictions especially among blue-collar workers negotiated by the social partners (14, 15). If we take the dimension `work–family conflict`, many would immediately think of the overworked white-collar worker with deadlines, eg, journalists, managers, or academics. But the occupational groups reporting the highest level of this conflict in Denmark are not these groups but rather truck drivers (an occupation directly subject to competition from peers from less regulated labor markets), health workers (including only one sole group of academics, namely medical doctors) and other workers subjected to night work (16). In order to understand what a variable really measures, inspection of occupational patterns can be invaluable for both practitioners and researchers. Even a lack of variation due to occupation can widen the understanding of what a variable measures. This applies, for example, to quality of leadership or social support (17, 18). These variables are assumed to rather reflect traits of organizations and departments than traits of occupations (19). So, even if research data in most cases serve purposes other than monitoring, it is worthwhile collecting and classifying data on occupation (even if it is costly) – or at least consulting local monitoring data – in order to understand better what working conditions measure. Working conditions: Monitoring trends versus investigating risk factors It is striking that monitoring data in general are collected in organizational settings other than those where data are used for research on associations between work, health and labor market participation (20, 21). Also, requirements of monitoring data are quite different from requirements of research data. In order to measure long-term trends, monitoring data should collect the same data over time. Only if new issues arise, old issues disappear, or profound methodological issues emerge, should changes in monitoring be introduced. One such methodological issue is the decreasing trend in participation in surveys (22). Researchers who, on the other hand, are looking at work as a possible predictor of health or labor market participation, tend to improve measurements and introduce new risk factors [therefore, the IPD-Work consortium approach of pooling data to overcome limited power of a majority of research datasets is challenged by deviating measurements of risk factors (23, 24)]. However, this does not mean that monitoring data are more conservative and research data more innovative. A comparison of psychosocial content of European monitoring questionnaires reveals a much wider focus on psychosocial factors than the one employed in longitudinal research of cardiovascular disease, burnout or depressive symptoms (25, 26). Note that the distinction of the labels 'monitoring' and 'research' assumes that dealing with prevalence and trends in working conditions is not research, an assumption which Corin et al`s paper in this issue of the journal refutes. Two challenges: Precariousness and border crossing In industrialized countries, most data on work and health are collected among workers employed as wage earners working in workplaces in their country of permanent residence. This restriction is challenged by (i) various types of precarious employment contracts and (ii) work arrangements crossing borders, ie, involving a dislocation of work from place of residence. Precarious employment contracts have been on the rise in recent decades and comprise, for example, temporary contracts (some very short term), no contract (including illegal schemes), self-employed one person employment and crowd work (27–30). Note that the prevalence of types of precarious work contracts differs very much from country to country (31). Workers on such contracts might be harder to reach in surveys. In some cases, they might be excluded from sampling frame definitions if the data provider (eg, the state or the company) does not register them as employees. Of course this problem does not arise in studies where the sample frame is based on resident populations allowing also for inclusion of workers not classified as such in registers (2–9). If however precarious workers are contacted in surveys, their uncertain or temporary (or even illegal) situation could make it difficult for them to consider themselves as employees and describe their work situation. Work arrangements crossing borders have also increased over the last decades (32, 33). This can involve – in its more simple form – border crossers, ie, workers living in one country working in another crossing borders on a daily basis (34). Such arrangements comprise among other things also posted workers [ie, those being sent by their company to work in another country on a temporary basis; this applies to workers in construction companies who are brought from the companies' country of location to the country where construction takes place (32, 35, 36)]. Another arrangement includes temporary migrant workers who work for a short period of time in agriculture, eg, harvest seasons or those who are employed as nannies, nurses or truck drivers in periods of several years (37, 38). Such temporary workers might seek work in another country on their own, they might be hired by the company they work for in their home country, or a third party might organize the work arrangement, which again can be formal, informal or illegal (39). Also workers crossing borders might be difficult to reach in surveys. They might not be part of sampling frames in the country – or company – where work is carried out (39). Moreover, when interviews are carried out, language barriers could hamper survey participation. To complicate things further aspects of precariousness and border crossing can flow together (eg, illegal work arrangements and residence), further complicating data collection. In some countries and sectors, these challenges (precariousness and border crossing) might play a role for the coverage of existing monitoring systems or research in work and health. Appropriate data collection and analytical methods exist and should be applied to meet these two challenges (40, 41). Concluding remarks After this, two important questions remain: (i) Do macro trends in working conditions show continuous improvements or deteriorations over time? (ii) Is there is a widening of inequalities in unfavourable working conditions, both within and between occupations? In many industrialized countries, monitoring data are available that can help answer these questions (20). For some working conditions, monitoring data over time are readily available in population and workforce- based surveys, whereas, for other work-related risk factors, data on trends over time are lacking. At least regarding European surveys, it seems that psychosocial factors are covered more broadly than physical factors (26, 42). Knowledge on trends are of paramount importance for (i) identification of new risk factors, (ii) determining whether occupational health interventions on the national level are successful, and (iii) the quantification of the health impact of various hazards. I hope that the present issue`s paper by Corin et al will lead to more contributions within this field of research. References 1.

Challenges in global surveillance of physical activity,2019,"The changing world is changing people, with movement being one of the clearest indicators of this change. The electronic revolution has fundamentally transformed people's movement patterns by changing where and how they live, learn, work, play, and travel, progressively isolating them indoors (eg, houses, schools, workplaces, and vehicles), most often in chairs.1Kleinert S Horton R Urban design: an important future force for health and wellbeing.Lancet. 2016; 388: 2848-2850Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar People sleep less, sit more, walk less frequently, drive more regularly, and do less physical activity than they used to.2Guthold R Stevens GA Riley LM Bull FC Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents: a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys with 1·6 million participants.Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2019; (published online Nov 21)https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(19)30323-2Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 3Tremblay MS Carson V Chaput JP et al.Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and youth: an integration of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep.Appl Physiol Nutr Metab. 2016; 41: S311-S327Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 4Aubert S Barnes JD Abdeta C et al.Global Matrix 3·0 physical activity report card grades for children and youth: results and analysis from 49 countries.J Phys Act Health. 2018; 15: S251-S273Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar They are increasingly moving from one country to another, from rural to urban areas, from outdoors to indoors, from standing to sitting, from walking to driving, and from active play to digital play and, at a macroscopic level, countries are moving through epidemiological and economic transitions at varying rates. These changes in the human exposome fundamentally affect our movement behaviours, patterns, and contexts and could have profound effects on human health. These effects and how they vary spatially, temporally, or culturally are important, particularly since physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for premature death worldwide, but remain poorly understood.5WHOGlobal health risks global health risks: MORTALITY and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks.

Using pooled data from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas, including 1·6 million students aged 11–17 years, they show that 81·0% (95% uncertainty interval 77·8–87·7) of adolescents are insufficiently physically active, with noticeably fewer insufficiently active boys (77·6% [76·1–80·4]) than girls (84·7% [83·0–88·2]). Furthermore, a significant temporal decrease between 2001 and 2016 was observed for boys whereas there was no change for girls, resulting in a widening of an already important sex difference. Socioeconomic patterns and trends at the country and regional levels were not consistent or clear, although the prevalence of insufficient physical activity was higher in low-income countries (84·9% [82·6–88·2]) than in high-income countries (79·3% [77·2–87·5]), somewhat counter to intuition and other findings.4Aubert S Barnes JD Abdeta C et al.Global Matrix 3·0 physical activity report card grades for children and youth: results and analysis from 49 countries.J Phys Act Health. 2018; 15: S251-S273Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar These results are arguably the best available estimates of global, regional, and temporal trends in adolescent physical activity levels, showing that the majority of adolescents do not meet current physical activity guidelines and that more boys than girls are active. Worldwide physical activity surveillance of adolescents is complex, susceptible to temporal and spatial drifts, and affected by many factors intervening at different times and with different intensities within and across countries. It is unknown whether brief, standardised questions about physical activity addressed to adolescents are equally valid across settings and countries and between sexes or whether the questions are interpreted in an equivalent way by each adolescent. Differences in these aspects might have affected Guthold and colleagues' findings by introducing measurement biases (due to country-specific or cultural-specific variability) or sex biases. Guthold and colleagues used available time trend data as well as possible, but the data are tenuous for reasons identified by the authors themselves (eg, differences in the number of countries, composition of countries, age ranges, sex balance, and questions or criteria for meeting guidelines across time).

This discord raises the question of whether either study, and if so which, is correct. Despite unequivocal evidence of health benefits of physical activity and of the extraordinary population attributable risk associated with insufficient physical activity, global surveillance of physical activity has been superficial, irregular, incomplete, and fraught with limitations.

Occupational health research: Challenges and opportunities in developing countries,2023,"The first Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century had to do with steam engines and the second one in the nineteenth century saw mass production and assembly line manufacturing – when occupational health and safety (OHS) came into focus. The third Industrial Revolution with computing, internet, and nuclear energy happened in the latter half of the twentieth century and even before we could wrap our heads around this, the fourth revolution encompassing the cyber-physical systems is underway and with it will be changes in our perspectives on occupational health (OH) and occupational health research (OHR). Changes like nonstandard employment, difficulties in OHS service delivery, over-dependency on newer technologies, newer forms of accidents, social disconnection, and weak unions will cause newer challenges in the future.[1] OHR OHR focuses on the study of the health and safety of workers in the workplace. The goal of OHR is to promote safe and healthy working conditions and to prevent work-related illness and injury. The broad categories of OHR are as follows: Investigation of work-related diseases and injuries Assessment of workplace hazards and risk factors Development of interventions and preventive measures Evaluation of the effectiveness of workplace health and safety programs Historically, disasters like the Minamata Bay disaster, the Bhopal Gas tragedy, and the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion has led to OHR assessing exposures and planning preventive strategies. However, through history, OHR was not regular and did not help the employees directly. Issues raised about OHR, in general, included the accusation that research distances workers from their own sufferings; that it was more for academic curiosity than for improving the lives of those affected; that it somehow benefitted the researchers; and that research ideas and findings were confined to seminar rooms.[2] Researchers have found that OHR from developing countries is not innovative or that it is an extension of research conducted in the country of graduate training, except for the suboptimal assessment of exposures and health outcomes.[3] ADVANTAGES OH has evolved from being reactive to treating diseases and injury to preventing diseases and injury and towards promoting health via work. This was made possible by OHR going hand-in-hand with OHS. Good OHR leads to setting safety standards, hazard identification, policy changes, and planning preventive measures. OHR adds advantages to the employer, management, and policymakers and it can increase productivity directly or indirectly. In a review article published in this journal in 2005, OHR in India was assessed and recommendations given included creating public-private partnerships, exposure assessments, disease surveillance in industries, analyzing occupation on death certificates, record linkage, conducting ecological correlation studies, embarking on large scale retrospective studies, and increasing international collaborations.[4] Perhaps, it is time now after 2 decades, after advancements in OHS and enhanced resources, to assess how far we have progressed and to identify where improvements are needed. CURRENT SCENARIO IN OHR Awareness about OH, safety, and hygiene is low among the workforce and community. The review article cited above states that OHR in India is complicated by child labor, poor legislations, a vast informal sector, low attention to industrial hygiene, and poor data surveillance or dissemination.[4] There is a need for OHR to be balanced between traditional occupational diseases and modern risk factors due to mechanization and the consequences of the third and fourth Industrial Revolutions listed above. Agriculture is still the predominant industry in India but research in this sector is less due to practical difficulties (such as the informal nature of employment) and the lack of dedicated OHR personnel. The ethical dilemma of highlighting gender-specific OH issues may compromise job equality in the workplace.[5] CHALLENGES IN OHR Common hurdles in OHR are lack of access to data, limited funding, diverse workplace exposures, confounders, ethical issues, difficulty in quantifying outcomes, and lack of generalizability. Combined with this, there is a lack of funding, research personnel, and misplaced management-driven research priorities.[6] Most of the research is descriptive and there is a genuine lack of quality interventional studies. Majority of the OH researchers are old and young professionals are hesitant to come into this doubtful career path.[7] Research priorities are not always met by research output, its impact, or its funding.[8] Developing countries do not have the means to convert OHR findings into effective policies as compared to developed nations.[9] The factory medical officer is isolated in his OHS facility without any collaborations with other sectors[9] and hence unable to do meaningful research. OH journals want research done in the workplace only and not the ones covering the socio-political effects of work.[9] Funding for research may be product-driven rather than demand-driven.[10] Nuwayhid describes the OHS cycle of neglect in developing countries which includes issues such as OH being a low priority to limited resources to inadequate research leading to poor evidence and limited partnerships.[9] This cycle can be broken with a change in attitude towards the risk exposures and forming alliances with social scientists, economists, and political scientists while ignoring others in the OH profession itself. OHR in developed nations has progressed further with good funding, robust data systems, and well-placed research priorities. OHR looks at evolving further by prioritizing interventional studies, increasing data dissemination, developing a young OHR workforce, aligning research with policymakers, showcasing research needs to funders, adapting to the changing nature of workplace hazards, and looking beyond the workplace.[811] Nuwayhid constructed a model about the internal domain of OHR [Figure 1] which includes work-related factors and an external contextual domain comprising the other layers.Figure 1: Modified Nuwayhid OHR model with internal and external domains[9]It was suggested that developed nations should conduct OHR from the internal to the external domain and that this should be the other way around in developing nations. This does not mean less priority for workplace hazards but seeing the internal domain in a broader context.[12] The outer-to-inner domain approach promotes partnerships with social, economic, and political experts. Historically, there are some problems like silicosis, asbestosis, and chemical exposures, which originate in the workplace but affect the family and society. OPPORTUNITIES OHR opportunities are enormous with the scientific technology and digital communication systems that are available today. Broad opportunities include the following: Enacting robust OH laws and a team to enforce them at the ground level, Increasing trained OH personnel dedicated to research, Influencing political will and funding for OHR, Strengthening international and local collaborations including public-private partnerships, and Demonstrating the value of robust research findings to stakeholders like funders and policymakers. OHR also needs proper leadership and multisectoral coordination.[4] OHR should prioritize the validity and strength of OH interventions rather than the economic constraints and socio-political feasibility. While some systems do exist, there are several ways in which modern technology can be enhanced or incorporated into OHR. To name a few: Mobile phone-based health education (messages and videos and assessing outcomes) Using newer equipment for industrial hygiene monitoring (particulate matter, light) Using data logging machines for continuous measurements (8-h sound levels, full shift dust exposures) Using videography in ergonomic assessments Using wearable devices like a smartwatch for measuring heart rates and activity in a shift Using drones for workplace monitoring and environmental measurements. We should recognize that migrant employees form a large proportion of most workplaces, and they come with different occupational hazards owing to heterogenicity, challenging environments, different diets, less access to healthcare, and an extra burden on their physical and mental health. OHR with migrants should evolve from simple cross-sectional studies to long-term cohort studies coupled with qualitative approaches.[13] The study design should be chosen based on the research question and feasibility. Rather than doing a single big study to address all questions, it is better to tackle each research question through multiple smaller studies.[14] Study designs like ecological or longitudinal studies can be readily done with the available data. Even though they may not be robust study designs, they provide the opportunity for further research and funding.[15] OHR should not be restricted to primary prevention like health education, vaccines, or protective equipment but it should also explore opportunities in secondary and tertiary prevention in OH. Research should also look at different screening methods for a risk specific to that workplace (like exposure measurements or designing surrogate indicators) and the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program for an employee returning after injury. The first people to realize something may be going seriously wrong in an organization are usually those who work there. Workers, with weak collective bargaining powers, are not empowered enough to understand the link between workplace exposure and disease to ensure societal pressure. In this context, participatory research improves commitment and job satisfaction, productivity, and safety compliance.[2] Employees can be involved in designing safety methods, risk surveys, focused workshops, and quality circles. Any preventive or promotional intervention at the workplace can be best assessed with a randomized controlled trial but it is suggested that this can be substituted by stepped wedge experiment or observational methods like propensity scores, instrumental variables, multiple baseline design, interrupted time series, difference-in-difference, and regression discontinuity.[16] There should be a repository of data on occupational exposures from the global burden of disease studies. Training in OHS in India is considered inadequate – there is a deficit of 58% of medical officers in relation to the number of employees in the organized sector.[17] Experts recommended competency-based OH education to get more young OH professionals into the field and thereby promote OHR.[1518] CONCLUSION Research should move on from identifiable and measurable workplace hazards to a more system-based approach on how the risk factors could affect the family and society. A shift in approach from measuring exposures and injuries to economic evaluations on workplace interventions is called for. Instead of considering the workplace as a threat to health, a different perspective of the positive impact of the workplace on health and family should also be recognized. OHR should move from measuring morbidity and injuries to investigating return on investments, the number of OH researchers trained, newer interventions designed and implemented, and the validity and effectiveness of these interventions.","['occupational', 'health', 'research:', 'challenges', 'opportunities', 'developing', 'countries']"
Assessment of Jordanian Radiologist Performance in the Detection of Breast Cancers,2018,"This study aims to monitor diagnostic accuracy amongst Jordanian mammography readers and identify parameters linked to higher levels of performance. In this study, we have used the Breast Screen Reader Assessment Strategy (BREAST) platform to facilitate 27 radiologists in reading a case set of 60 digital mammograms, 20 of which included cancers. Each case consisted of the four standard cranio-caudal (CC) and medio-lateral oblique (MLO) projections. All radiologists were registered to read mammograms at their workplace by the Jordanian Ministry of Health. Each reader was asked to locate any malignancies, provide a confidence rating using a scale of 1 - 5, and identify the type of appearance. All images were displayed using 8 MP monitor, supported by radiology workstations with full image manipulation facilities. Results were evaluated using Jackknife Alternative Free-Response Receiver Operating Characteristic (JAFROC). Demographics obtained from each radiologist regarding their experience, qualifications and breast-reading activities were correlated against JAFROC scores using Spearman techniques. The results showed that the mean JAFROC score was 0. 52 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46, 0.58); location sensitivity score was 0. 41 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.56); specificity score was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.83). Higher performance in term of JAFROC scores was directly related to number of years since professional qualification (r = 0.433; p = 0.024), number of years reading breast images (r = 0.62; r = 0.001) and number of mammography images read per year (r = 0.69; p = 0.001). On the other hand, higher performance was inversely linked to the frequency of reading other modalities per week (r = -0.48; p = 0.010). No other statistical differences were significant. Finally, higher radiologists’ performance in cancer detection is correlated with increasing the number of mammograms reads per week.","['assessment', 'jordanian', 'radiologist', 'performance', 'detection', 'breast', 'cancers']"
‘Internet of Ears’ and Hearables for Hearing Loss Prevention,2019,"New technologies are reshaping health interventions across disciplines. This technological surge offers a clear opportunity to expand and improve hearing health, particularly in hearing loss prevention. A person's hearing health trajectory is defined by his or her overall hazardous exposures, environmental factors, and genetic determinates.1 Among the many factors that can contribute to hearing health (such as overall health, smoking, diet, and ototoxicant exposure), reducing noise exposure—particularly at work—has the greatest potential to significantly decrease the burden of hearing loss and tinnitus.2 About 24 percent of hearing impairment cases among U.S. workers is attributable to workplace noise exposures. Because noise-induced hearing loss is preventable, approximately one-fourth of hearing impairment cases in this population may be avoided by adopting preventive measures.3 While progress has been made toward the prevention of work-related hearing loss, it remains among the most common occupational illnesses. Overall, nearly one in four U.S. adults has audiometric evidence of noise-induced hearing loss—and most do not realize it.4 People continue to focus on the use of hearing protection to reduce noise exposure, even though only limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of this approach.5 However, new technologies to measure and control noise and test hearing hold the promise of expedited progress.Using the NIOSH sound level meter app to measure noise at a metal manufacturing plant. healthcare, hearing aids, digital healthIntensity levels of common sounds. Repeated exposure to sounds 85 dBA and higher can cause hearing loss. Healthcare, hearing aids, digital healthRISE OF MOBILE APPS, WEARABLES In 2018, nearly 40 percent of the world's population owned a smartphone, with smartphone penetration exceeding 70 percent in many countries, including the developing world.6 Hundreds of mobile applications (apps) related to noise and hearing loss are available, with new and improved apps appearing nearly every month. These apps can empower individuals to become more proactive in protecting their hearing health. In the past, a person needed expensive instrumentation and professional expertise to learn about their noise exposure. Nowadays, smartphone apps can accurately estimate noise exposure and make recommendations for appropriate protection.7,8 These tools, in conjunction with online information (e.g., NIOSH Sound Level Meter and Know Your Noise), provide mechanisms for individuals to manage their risk and protect their hearing. Other apps are now available to conduct hearing tests, measure daily sound allowance from music listening devices, and use crowdsourcing to provide information about environmental noise and quiet entertainment and dining venues (e.g., NoiseCapture, NoiseAdapt, NoiseScore, iHEARu, SoundPrint, etc.). Given the limitations of pure-tone audiometry for the early identification of ear damage, several groups have been looking into testing alternatives. Research has shown that audiometric thresholds obtained in untreated open rooms through mobile, wireless automated hearing test systems exhibit within subject test–retest reliability comparable to thresholds obtained using conventional computer-automated audiometry conducted in a single-walled, sound-treated booth in a mobile trailer.9 The development of portable, easily operated, economical, and reliable alternatives can facilitate hearing testing in typical worksite locations. Additional research is needed to make sure that such tools are accurate and can meet international sound and hearing measurement standards, but work is underway to establish compliance with pertinent standards.10 Wearable technologies are attracting attention in other health fields and could be useful in hearing loss prevention as well. Fitness trackers collect large amounts of data that data could be delivered directly to patient medical records, creating a mobile health (mHealth) system that gives health care professionals access to a patient's real-time data to aid in diagnosis and monitoring. At present, the primary limitation is sensor technology.11 As sensor technology improves, one could imagine monitoring noise exposure levels from a smart wristwatch and providing them directly to a hearing health or workplace safety professional—providing insight into hearing risk and enabling targeted prevention strategies. AI-POWERED HEARABLES Companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon along with established hearing aid companies are moving fast to introduce artificial intelligence into earphones and earpieces called hearables. This marketplace will not only deliver higher sound fidelity to the ear by cancelling unwanted background noise, but will also learn the user's environment and listening habits to deliver a better listening experience. In addition, hearables can be constantly connected and deliver information straight to the user's ears. Communicating in the opposite direction, the “Internet of Ears” is expanding the realm of voice-activated devices and may soon make it possible to control a myriad of household devices—including noise sources such as televisions and music players—by voice command. As these technologies become more commonplace, research into the total sound energy delivered daily to the ear needs to be studied, and recommendations from regulatory bodies need to be established to protect people from unsafe exposure to sound in recreational and work settings. ADDRESSING NOISE AT WORK The hierarchy of controls emphasizes protecting workers from the harmful effects of noise through elimination and reduction of hazards whenever possible, and emerging technologies are improving our ability to do so.12 For instance, nanomaterials offer the potential to effectively reduce noise across the frequency spectrum–including very low frequencies, where traditional sound absorption materials perform poorly.13 Cutting-edge technologies should not, however, cause us to lose sight of more basic solutions that may be very appropriate in some instances. For example, winners of the annual Safe-In-Sound http://bit.ly/2F4IWUi AwardsTM have implemented simple changes that have helped reduce noise levels such as large displays providing continuous noise monitoring results and changing from metal to rubber cart wheels. The CDC's Buy Quiet http://bit.ly/2EWwvcW is another key strategy for long-term noise reduction that relies on the purchase of new, quieter equipment.14 Hearing protection falls lower on the hierarchy of controls for noise exposure; however, many workplace hearing loss prevention programs still focus primarily on hearing protectors. One serious limitation of this approach is the inability to know exactly how much hearing protection a worker receives from the device. Fit-testing technology has changed that. Multiple systems are available that allow employers and other hearing care professionals to quickly evaluate how much sound reduction an individual is receiving from a particular device. Such information is invaluable to ensure that noise-exposed individuals are sufficiently protected and it can dramatically improve training, re-fitting, and the identification of appropriate alternatives as necessary.15 NIOSH has a web-based fit-test “screening” http://bit.ly/2EXnvUV that can be used if a full fit-test system is unavailable.16 Innovative and imaginative entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by these new technologies, bringing products to market that many hearing care professionals may never have imagined. In 2016, several U.S. federal occupational safety and health agencies launched the Hear and Now Noise Safety Challenge http://bit.ly/2EYCz4H, inviting individuals to compete for funding to develop creative ideas for reducing the occupational hearing loss problem.17 More than 30 entries were received, with winning ideas that included wearable sensors to monitor personal safety and information platforms that integrate health and safety data from different devices into a single, real-time database. Although new technologies offer many new prospects for hearing loss prevention, cutting-edge technology isn't always essential to make an intervention successful. Several Hear and Now challenge winners proposed simple ideas that could promote hearing loss prevention, such as adding logos to create fashionable hearing protection devices and using a simple, disposable device to insert foam earplugs properly and hygienically. Every hearing health professional—regardless of discipline, employment setting, or population served—has a role to play in ensuring that these emerging technologies help prevent hearing loss. Government agencies, standard-setting bodies, and professional organizations need to provide guidelines for developers to ensure that new technologies meet professional standards. Clinicians and safety professionals should implement emerging technologies however they can in their practices and provide feedback to developers on ways to improve or expand their utility. New technologies should help people make informed decisions about their noise exposure and take an active role in protecting their hearing, increase the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention and intervention programs, and reduce the burden of hearing disorders on society.

The technostress questionnaire: a pilot study,2021,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) represent one of the major drivers of economic growth and collective evolution, with positive repercussions on the world of labor. Despite several benefits, technology is substantially altering the nature and organization of work, posing possible psychosocial, organizational and ergonomic risks as outlined by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and current strategic documents of the European Commission. The novel COVID-19 pandemic has further accentuated the burden of the use of ICT, emphasizing the importance of occupational safety and health practices. Nevertheless, the topic of digital stress is not yet carefully considered in the Italian context. The purpose of this exploratory study is to create a new psychometric tool aimed at investigating the key dimensions of technostress. In particular, the psychometric properties of each scale (reliability and dimensionality) were preliminarily analyzed. The spread of ICT modifies the characteristics of traditional stressors (e.g. job demands) while contributing to the spread of new stressors (e.g. privacy and pervasiveness), leading to what is called “technostress”. Since the first definition of technostress introduced by Brod (1984), the construct has been operationalized according to different perspectives and is now consensually recognized as a major threat to the health of workers. For the realization of the items and the identification of the areas of investigation, the concepts of stress, work-related stress and technostress were examined together with the main theoretical models and pre-existing psychometric tools. The items belonging to each dimension were then generated according to a deductive path. The qualitative analyses regarding content validity led to a total of 80 items and 15 scales (usefulness/usability, reliability, technology self-efficacy, role, multitasking, job control, job demands, pace of change, pervasiveness/work- life balance, privacy/monitoring, employability, supervisor support, colleague support, involvement and training) which were administered to a sample of 235 subjects. Reliability analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFA) (principal axis factoring (PAF) with suppression of factor loadings below 0.30 and promax rotation) were performed for each scale. The internal consistency analyses showed values ranging from fairly good (α = 0.60) to excellent (α = 0.88) depending on the scale, providing encouraging results for a future in-depth analysis of the instrument. The exploratory factor analyses provided good initial results, yielding to a two-factor solution only in the case of the “multitasking” scale. Given the exploratory nature of the study, the validation process was limited to the analysis of reliability and dimensionality. Future studies will need to further analyze the structure of the scales in order to identify which model best represents the constructs, using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) methods to evaluate the goodness of this version. The practical implications concern the creation of specific policies at company, sectoral and national level with a focus on an advanced workplace risk assessment. Once validated, the questionnaire could be used for tailor-made organizational diagnoses and targeted interventions.","['technostress', 'questionnaire:', 'pilot', 'study']"
"Sit, Stand, Learn",2015,"Prolonged sitting time is a risk factor for adverse health outcomes and also has been associated with negative impacts on worker productivity (1,3,4,6–8,10–12,15). As an increasingly common instance of sedentary behavior, prolonged sitting time is related to premature mortality (1,7,12), chronic disease (3,4,6,11), metabolic syndrome (3,4), and obesity (3,6). Programs and products have emerged that are designed to assist individuals in breaking up extended periods of sitting time. Most of these interventions have occurred in workplace settings (10), where workers often spend more than half of their days sitting (8). This emerging body of research has shown positive effects, including physical as well as emotional health, such as mood states (14). Furthermore, the introduction of sit-stand and movement breaks also appears to impact worker performance and productivity positively (13). Given that the introduction of sit-stand devices at the workplace made employees feel better and be more productive (13,14), it would make sense to translate such findings to other settings. Might we want to consider alternative contexts where improved mood and attention to task could really make an important difference in health and other nonhealth outcomes? For example, what if such lessons learned were applied to the classroom settings where students with special needs are taught technical skills to help them contribute meaningfully to society? GENERATING PRACTICE-BASED EVIDENCE Based on preliminary evidence (2,5,14,15) that intermittent standing improves performance among office workers, it is entirely reasonable to consider that a similar approach in an educational setting will generate a positive impact as well. Intermediate School District (ISD) 287 is a consortium of 12 school districts in Western Hennepin County, in the greater Minneapolis area. The Assistive Technology Training and Information Network (ATTAIN) Lab at ISD 287 serves youth aged 14 to 21 years with a variety of special needs. The ATTAIN Lab strives to assist and train students in building vocational skills through an applied technologically based curriculum. The goal of the program is to teach youth marketable technical skills that will increase their chances of leading meaningful work lives after graduation. During the course of 40 days in the fall of 2013, the ATTAIN Lab students participated in a Sit-Stand Action Research Project. ACTION RESEARCH IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING Action Research takes place within the existing operations of various settings, in this case, the ATTAIN Lab. It is often guided by practitioners in an effort to improve everyday practice (9). After reading about the effects of sit-stand devices on worker outcomes, the director of the ATTAIN Lab reached out to local researchers to learn if similar devices might help his students. The resulting partnership focused on a Sit-Stand Action Research Project designed to measure the impact of sit-stand devices on a variety of student outcomes. Using the Action Research framework, we systematically observed and measured sitting, standing, and related behaviors within the standard operating procedures of the ATTAIN Lab at ISD 287. The Project commenced in October 2013 and ran for 40 consecutive school days.STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION Random assignment was used to group the 13 ATTAIN Lab students into the intervention and comparison groups. The intervention group received sit-stand devices that enabled them to alternate easily between sitting and standing. Devices were provided by Ergotron, an Eagan, Minnesota-based manufacturer of mobility products. Students were prompted by the ATTAIN Lab staff to stand for at least 5 minutes every 30 minutes and could opt to stand longer. The daily work of students in the ATTAIN Lab is monitored by a job coach. It generally is the role of the job coach to supervise the student and provide project oversight and troubleshooting as appropriate. Building on this role, the job coach was responsible for daily data collection during the course of the 40-day project. The job coach was provided access to an iPad for the purpose of completing an online project questionnaire daily. For the majority of measures collected, the job coach observed the student’s behavior and completed the questionnaire. For select measures, the job coach engaged the student and entered the student’s responses on the questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to measure behavioral and emotional outcomes (Supplemental Digital Content 1: Questionnaire, https://links.lww.com/FIT/A21). STUDENT PARTICIPANTS In October 2013, a total of 13 students from the ATTAIN Lab were invited to participate in the project. Students ranged in age from 16 to 21 (average, 18 years). Special needs among the group included autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, developmental cognitive disability, emotional and behavioral disorders, and speech and language disorder. Parental consent to participate in the action research project was obtained before the start. Random assignment was used in the selection of intervention and comparison group participants. Students were excluded from the final analysis because of: Lack of data ○ Students with fewer than 30 valid questionnaires were excluded from the final analysis. Attrition ○ Several students from the comparison group were excluded from the final analysis because of persistent absenteeism and class reassignment. After excluding seven students for these reasons, a total of six students were included in the final analysis. These included four students in the intervention group and two students in the comparison group (Supplemental Digital Content 2: Device photo, https://links.lww.com/FIT/A22). RESULTS Students were encouraged to stand for at least 5 minutes every 30 minutes and could choose to stand longer if desired. Initially, it took some time for students to get used to the devices. For the first week of the project, none of the students stood for the minimum recommended time. However, after 1 week with the desks installed, the majority of students in the intervention group started standing — and did so for more than the minimum suggested time. Notable improvements were observed using the Quality of Work Scale. We used an existing ISD 287 measurement tool named Community-Curriculum-Based Assessment/Training Comprehensive Performance Profile. The scale rates students’ ability to perform a variety of tasks using a 1-to-5 rating (1 = unable; 5 = with minimal supervision). The job coaches rated each student during each day of the project. Students in the intervention group experienced, on average, greater improvements in Quality of Work during the course of the project compared with those in the comparison group. Students who were able to stand realized a 25-point increase on the scale between days 1 and 40, whereas students who did not have that option saw a 5-point increase (Supplemental Digital Content 3: Quality of Work Scale, https://links.lww.com/FIT/A23). Improvements also were observed regarding student behavior. Behavior was measured using a set of 10 questions designed to assess students’ interpersonal problems, inappropriate behavior, unhappiness, and inability to learn. We created the behavior measurement scale based on constructs known to impact student behavior outlined in the 1997 Individuals with Disabilities Act. In this case, a higher score is equated with better overall behavior. The job coaches rated each student at baseline and again at the end of the project. Among the four students in the intervention group, behavior improved during the course of the 40-day project. For the two students in the comparison group, behavior either remained the same or worsened (Supplemental Digital Content 4: Behavior, https://links.lww.com/FIT/A24). DISCUSSION This pilot project represents a promising example of practice-based evidence, translating research from one setting (workplace) to another (classroom). Within 40 consecutive school days, we successfully collected data while maintaining the ongoing processes of the ATTAIN Lab and standard workload of the students. Importantly, the project demonstrated initial evidence that alternating between sitting and standing can improve student outcomes. This was observed both in the quality of student work and an improvement in disruptive student behavior. Workplace wellness successes may translate to other settings, thereby generating important improvements in health for other groups or populations. This approach may be useful in guiding efforts that reduce health disparities and address health inequalities that may exist in the community. In this case, a special needs population benefits from learnings derived among office workers both in terms of exposure to a healthier behavior as well as the nonhealth benefits of improved performance while at school. The potential of cross-sector collaborations that, at the local level, promote and improve community health is substantial. This project, with workplace wellness taking the lead, represents but one small example of how such progress may be made while positioning business and industry as important and meaningful partners in community health improvement.","['sit,', 'stand,', 'learn']"

The current AI hype and innovative and powerful undertakings are set to change this trend: digital supporting communities and private companies are aiming to dramatically increase the number of women in AI by inspiring and promoting female role models in this sector through education and employing of women in AI-related technologies. Organizations such as Girls Who Code (https://girlswhocode.com/), Women in Technology (https://www.womenintechnology.org/), the AnitaB.org (https://anitab.org/), and Women In Technology International (https://witi.com/) have as a main goal increasing the number of women in tech-related jobs with their programs and services worldwide. In this Opinion piece, we present Women AI Academy (WAIA, https://womenaiacademy.com/), founded on the principle of a new working culture of digital technology to enable women to build successful digital technical careers in AI. The aim is to address two critical dimensions: an ever-increasing need for women-working empowerment in the tech industry (women still make up only a quarter of the tech industry workforce1World Economic ForumGlobal Gender Gap Report 2020.https://www.weforum.org/reports/gender-gap-2020-report-100-years-pay-equalityDate: 2019Google Scholar) and the workforce need for digital technologies experts (it is estimated that, only in the US, there will be 3.5 million computer-science-related jobs available by 2026)9NCWITWomen and Information Technology, By the Numbers.https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_05092019_web.pdfDate: 2019Google Scholar.

It involves the concept of digital learning circles and groups the skills that are needed to have a successful career in AI and a harmonized personal life in three categories: mindset skills, soft skills, and digital tech/AI skills. Aiming to be inclusive and location independent, all content are delivered online by experts and mentors from the AI industry, in English. WAIA has four core principles:Equality: here we aim to increase the participation of a diverse AI community, eradicating discrimination based on gender, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, or social background.Mobility: everyone should have the opportunity to grow their career; being a tech-based discipline, AI offers this possibility.Digital-tech/AI focus: we contribute toward the acquisition of skills needed for digital technologies with focus on AI and a technical workplace.Community: strongly linked to the previous principles, WAIA's platform offers the ""sense of belonging,"" building up a community at the same time as we form AI professionals. According to studies, 56% of women in technology leave their employers mid-career,7Sassler S. Glass J. Levitte Y. Michelmore K.M. The missing women in STEM? Assessing gender differentials in the factors associated with transition to first jobs.Soc Sci Res. 2017; 63: 192-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar this being at least partially related to a lack of supportive mentors and role models and other workplace-related barriers as discussed above. These principles can be generalized across all data science platforms, and they are not gender specific. In other words, they represent good guiding principles for building data science communities. WAIA was founded on the experiences and lessons learned from over 25 years in the tech business world. Naz, the founder, started it as a side project to her corporate job. In 2012, she started to study issues for gender equality in tech, especially from her perspectives as a working mum with two school-aged kids. During this time, she networked with experts around the world, joined in conferences, and participated in STEM mentorship projects. She searched and reviewed the best practices not only from Europe but also from the US and Australia. As part of her corporate assignments and independent research, she has developed valuable insights into the digital industrial revolution and new working culture of digital technology, and as a result, she decided to develop an online teaching organization to enable women to build successful digital careers in AI. WAIA serves also as a community of like-minded women, with a diverse team and background of founding members as well as carefully selected teaching experts and mentors from around the world. There are reasons to be hopeful, for the first time more women than men enrolled in intro computer science at Berkeley, USA.3Gilpin L.

We believe that for everyone involved in AI, the ethics of AI is of pivotal importance and, therefore, is a primary concern of WAIA. AI heavily relies on the origin, quality, and quantity of data and also on the diversity of the team designing the associated algorithms and individual society's value on dictating the norms. Therefore, these factors can be seen to impact the ethics of AI. In our view, there is a great mystification of AI capabilities. This is, in its own right, an important issue; however, there is a direct consequence of this that ultimately affects the ethics of AI: the belief that the ethical challenges of AI can be solved with code. The issues involved are far more complex. For example, the unintentional algorithm bias in women's healthcare can be inevitable due to scarcity in scientific studies and data of cause of an illness in one specific ethnic minority group.10Carter S.M.

Diversity in its broad sense: gender, race, age, discipline, expertise. . . . Those who have been underprivileged in the current ecosystems will be the main victims if we do not address the existing biases and defects. We believe in the need for definitions, common understanding, regulations, and monitoring systems for all stakeholders who design, develop, deploy, and operate AI. These standards and systems for ethical AI will be one of the major challenges in the future, and WAIA has exciting plans to address this matter. Among other projects, which like WAIA offer teaching in AI-related subjects, we can mention the Barcelona-based AllWomen.tech, offering onsite data science courses, and the IE Data Science Bootcamp, an 11-week program for women to learn data science, located in the heart of IE's Madrid campus. Women in AI (WAI) is a nonprofit do-tank working toward gender-inclusive AI that benefits global society.

Remote Work: Challenges and strategies for Effective Management,2024,"The development of remote employment has affected workplace practices. This study examines the complexities of remote work and proposes management methods to address its issues. Owing to global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of remote work is rapidly increasing, necessitating managers to reconsider their approaches. Interstate communication is a significant concern. Employers need to use Slack and Skype as means to assess the communication proficiency of job candidates. The study highlights the need of maintaining employee well-being by effectively managing a combination of flexibility and structured routines to combat fatigue and the blurring of work and personal life boundaries. Essential components include secure cloud solutions, standardised hardware, and measures to ensure data integrity. Effective remote project management necessitates a harmonious blend of autonomy and accountability, hence it is advisable to use technology that minimise distractions and rely on cloud-based solutions. Identifying and developing talent in remote teams involves specified performance targets and career development criteria. Virtual environments pose challenges to visibility and consistency, yet digital technology enable progress monitoring and foster a unified organisational culture. Retention is vital, hence virtual meetings and work-life balance are encouraged. The study revealed that directly addressing these challenges may lead to the development of a robust and productive remote workforce, ensuring success in the evolving work environment.","['remote', 'work:', 'challenges', 'strategies', 'effective', 'management']"
Strategies for Enhancing Governmental Public Health Workforce Well-being and Retention,2023,"Moral injury and workforce burnout constrain public health agencies' operational capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency and scope of public health professionals' work, while decreasing individual capacity and effectiveness. Nearly half of all public health workers left their positions between 2017 and 2021.1 In 2021, 55% of public health employees polled reported 1 or more posttraumatic stress disorder symptom.2 These alarming rates highlight the importance of making the public health workforce's long-term well-being an organizational priority to prevent adverse downstream effects on population health outcomes. Governmental public health agencies, as compared with private industry,3,4 face unique restrictions when it comes to recruitment, retention, and employee experience. These limitations include formal policies around human resources, civil service classifications and procedures, and political processes and pressure that can complicate efforts to address the public health workforce's needs. In addition, while workforce burnout was an issue even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,1 the scale and importance of public health worker responsibilities ballooned during the pandemic response. The need for contact tracing, data collection and reporting, vaccine planning and distribution, and effective public communication remained priorities, while public and political criticism contributed to an atmosphere of hostility toward the public health workforce.5 This workforce therefore remains dedicated to the public health mission but continues to feels the strain brought about by a traumatic few years.2 Government agencies are now at risk of pivoting from an emergency public health response to more routine operations without the technical expertise or capacity to address serious workforce issues. Survey data show these issues may lead to continued turnover and loss of expertise across all ranks of public health agencies. Since 2014, ASTHO has collaborated with the de Beaumont Foundation to conduct the Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS), which is disseminated to public health agencies nationwide and contains specific questions related to workforce demographics, job characteristics, training needs, intent to stay or leave, professional engagement and satisfaction, and other areas.2 The concept of ""workforce well-being"" is a measure of the overall functional health of the public health workforce, ensuring its ability to perform at a high level of engagement and operational readiness over an extended period. Monitoring trends in agency-level responses to employee mental and emotional well-being can provide direction and justification for building workforce well-being efforts into agency priorities and plans, such as by developing healthy supervisory relationships, mitigating sources of work-related stress, ensuring manageable workloads, and improving infrastructure and staffing levels. More than ever, it is imperative for leaders and policy makers to prioritize workforce well-being and retention strategies to ensure continuity of public health operations. A Technical Package of Practical Recommendations In this column, ASTHO recommends this technical package of strategies to support state, territorial, and local health department efforts to address burnout and moral injury among governmental public health workers and improve retention. ASTHO technical packages are based on our subject matter experts' assessment of evidence-based strategies, expert recommendations, overviews of current activities, and a review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal funding guidance. They are not intended to be comprehensive. They provide a more focused and proactive approach to our technical assistance roles. There is a relative dearth of research on the issue of government agency workforce sustainability, and future recommendations should incorporate the growing body of research. At present, ASTHO has prioritized specific areas of work—outlined in Supplemental Digital Content Table (available at https://links.lww.com/JPHMP/B188). Developing effective and skilled managers Supervisors play a significant role in employee well-being and satisfaction.6 Developing supervisory skills in leadership and management, as well as an understanding of trauma-informed principles and practices, is critical to improving employee well-being and reducing burnout. Typically used in clinical settings, public health agencies can apply a trauma-informed approach to strengthen population health strategies with communities,7 as well as integrating these principles into agency policies, communications, and initiatives with the desired goal of reducing stress caused by structural and organizational factors.8 Public health agencies should support supervisors through management training and coaching to develop leadership skills at all levels of a public health agency, and the ongoing modeling and application of these skills by agency leaders. Creating positive workplace culture and connection A positive workplace culture is based on employees' feelings about their team and agency and how they perceive the organization values them. Employees' experience—beginning with attracting and recruiting qualified staff and spanning the entire time an employee spends with an agency—is critical to an employee's decision to stay or leave an organization. Survey data show that poor organizational culture is a known driver of public health agency disengagement and turnover, in turn presenting a threat to public health agencies' operational readiness.2 Yet, policies to support employees from the time they begin onboarding for a position are underdeveloped and deprioritized, either due to lack of resources or due to urgency of the agency's public health mission. In addition, an agency's commitment to internal diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and belonging can affect employee satisfaction with agency culture as well as engagement and psychological safety. Balancing the mission-critical demands of daily public health work with the sustainability needs of the workforce can be a challenging task, but building on the development of supervisory skills across the agency provides a foundation for the ongoing work to improve workplace culture and prioritize connection. ASTHO's PH-HERO Workforce Resource Center provides a source for vetted resources intended to support these efforts. Building infrastructure for a supported and fairly compensated workforce If workplace culture is how employees feel about their job, workforce infrastructure is the policies and resources available to employees to compensate and support them in their jobs. Pay was cited as the top reason individuals considered leaving public health agencies in 2021.2 Governmental public health agencies have salary range and other state personnel rule limitations but can review pay scales and to ensure pay equity across the organization. Looking beyond pay, public health agencies can look to offer other benefits to their total compensation packages, such as tuition reimbursement, student loan assistance, or enhanced benefits such as employee assistance programs. In addition to supplying compensation, agencies can support their workforce through tools and processes that make employees' jobs less stressful and more rewarding. Through thoughtful design and leveraging of technology, implementation of employee-centered policies such as standardized onboarding programs, retention interviews, flexible work arrangements, and employee councils, public health agencies can build an infrastructure for workplace satisfaction and retention. Staffing to advance workforce priorities and manage workloads Regardless of the improvements in organizational culture and management skill, if an agency is unable to fill positions for required workloads, stress and burnout will accumulate across the workforce and counteract any culture and process improvements. Likewise, if agency leadership commits to organizational change to improve workforce culture but fails to staff and empower individuals to prioritize this work, it faces long odds for success against the many competing needs facing a public health agency. Prioritizing recruitment and timely hiring to fill vacancies will minimize stress caused by increased workloads. Advancing agency commitments to improve workforce culture and retention is necessarily a long process. It requires dedicated workforce staff who have technical expertise and the authority to engage senior staff within the public agency to influence and champion changes and new concepts, and support from staff throughout the agency to ensure follow-through across many initiatives. Understaffing the team tasked with this work, or reducing the access or influence of this team, risks rendering their work ineffective, exacerbating workforce burnout, and potentially wasting resources through a lack of organizational commitment to these priorities. Conclusion This package of strategies can be used to revitalize the public health workforce and create an infrastructure that supports the engagement, well-being, and retention of public health professionals for the future. ASTHO intends to support jurisdictions in their efforts to implement these evidence-based strategies to strengthen the sustainability of the public health workforce. Public health agencies will increasingly have opportunities to tailor these recommendations to develop specific strategies for their workforce needs based on their agency's employee survey and assessment data. Evaluation of the effectiveness of these strategies will inform future efforts for agencies to contribute to an evidence base for others to build upon and refine.","['strategies', 'enhancing', 'governmental', 'public', 'health', 'workforce', 'well-being', 'retention']"
Prevention of Gender-Based Violence and Harassment at Workplace in India,2023,"Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Targets 5.1 and 5.2 of goal 5 aim to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere and eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation. These spheres include the workplace as well.[1] All persons in India are equal before the law, and the state does not discriminate against any citizen on the grounds of sex and provides liberty for all as per Articles 14, 15, and 21 of the constitution of India.[2] It is important to understand that the state does not discriminate against individuals based on the social construct of gender or biological sex. India ratifies the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and adopts measures to achieve full equality between men and women.[3] Over recent years, many measures have been undertaken by different ministries and sectors to achieve gender equality. However, the country ranks 122 in the Global Gender Inequality Index and 135 in the Global Gender Gap Index.[4] Female empowerment and economic participation are crucial to achieve a better rank in these composite indices. The public health issue of gender-based violence (GBV) is deeply rooted in gender inequality. GBV can occur to any individual because of their gender. This includes women, men, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals. Women suffer disproportionately from the GBV. Violence against women is any act of violence based on gender that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women. These acts could include threats of acts, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty in public or private life.[5] Domestic violence occurring in families or between intimate partners can be physical, psychological, emotional, economic, or sexual. Sexual harassment is a type of violence against women under the sexual violence category. When it occurs at the workplace, it is called workplace sexual harassment (WSH). When it occurs in public places, it is called street harassment. As per the International Labour Organization, WSH contains the following important elements – Quid pro quo: Any physical, verbal, or nonverbal conduct of a sexual nature and other conduct based on sex affecting the dignity of women and men, which is unwelcome, unreasonable and offensive to the recipient, and a person's rejection of, or submission to, such conduct is used explicitly or implicitly as a basis for a decision which affects the person's job and Hostile working environment: Conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile or humiliating working environment for the recipient.[6] Women's labor participation is increasing at the cost of double the burden of paid work at the workplace and unpaid domestic chores and child-rearing responsibilities at home.[7] A working woman can be considered as empowered; however, due to the gendered division of labor, women face this double burden. Only around a third of women in the country participate in the labor force, and if this population, while at work, experiences WSH, it compromises the achievement of decent work which aims to achieve fair income, secure workplace, social protection, liberty for individuals to share their concerns and equal opportunity and treatment irrespective of gender.[8] Assessment of the prevalence of WSH is a challenge due to cultures of silence at the workplace due to gender dynamics at the workplace and the society at large. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of research or mixed methods can be conducted to assess the precise estimate of this problem at the workplace. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), across sectors, when WSH surveys are conducted in query method, the prevalence ranges from 0.6–26.1%. However, when behavioral acts such as sexually colored comments, inappropriate staring, unwelcome touch, and cat calls are included, the prevalence ranges from 14.5–98.8%. Victim-survivors of WSH usually neglect, resist, or tolerate the issue.[9] Due to the stigma around this issue, researchers should build trust with the workers and use participatory methods to assess the prevalence. In India, the prevalence of WSH is around 33–53%, and it is prevalent across all sectors and in all designations in women. Younger and migrant populations are more vulnerable.[10,11] In both these groups, there are challenges in collective bargaining, and among migrants, linguistic issues and lack of social protection in the state to which they have migrated can pose threats. A study done among retail shop women workers in Vellore City observed that 50% of them have experienced WSH in various forms. In this study, the common act of WSH experienced by women was of men calling them with words of endearment.[12] Currently, in the online or digital space, cyberbullying of women, nonconsensual sexting, and doxing, which involve the public release of private information, also occur. WSH, similar to any type of violence against women, has both physical, mental, and social well-being consequences. In extreme cases, rape and murder of workers also have been reported in the media. Reproductive health consequences such as unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections also can occur. The consequences of the mental and emotional well-being of a woman after WSH are long-term. Trauma and stress reactions, frustration, and passivity associated with WSH result in low self-esteem, leading to depression. WSH experiences can affect brain functions, affecting memory, concentration, and attention. Persons who experience WSH have higher levels of depression, and this has long-term effects on depressive symptoms in adulthood.[13] WSH is associated with increased odds of depression in a dose-response manner; more increase in reporting is associated with higher chances of depression.[14] Even in feminized occupations such as nursing, the prevalence of WSH can range up to 71%, and it is associated with depression, anxiety, and stress.[15] Feminized occupations such as the garment industry do not provide any protection from WSH because the power lies in the hands of men or women in superior positions who can harass the women. A cohort study done in Sweden has observed an association between WSH, illegitimate tasks (those tasks perceived as unnecessary due to violation of norms of what an employee is legitimately expected to perform) and burn out and depression.[16] A study done among humanitarian workers has observed that WSH increases depression and anxiety symptoms.[17] In the unorganized sector, sex workers are at high risk for violence. The current targeted interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections among sex workers and decriminalization of the work under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act are not sufficient to address the violence they experience from their clients. As per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013, an Internal Committee (IC) has to be constituted by every employer with a presiding officer who is a senior female employee, a minimum two employees from the workplace and one member from an external nongovernmental organization. For the benefit of the unorganized sector, every district has a Local Committee (LC), which is coordinated by the district head, usually a District Collector, with monitoring by the State Women Commission.[18] Any aggrieved woman can make in writing her complaint within 3 months of the date of the incident. After an inquiry into the complaint, the employer shall act upon the recommendations of the committee, and the act of sexual harassment must be considered as misconduct under the service rules. However, most women do not report WSH due to a lack of trust in the organization, its redressal mechanism, lack of legal awareness, professional victimization, retaliation, and stigma. Also, there is fear of loss of employment as well.[19] Workplaces are complex environments, and it is important to find, prevent, and mitigate the adverse human rights impacts. This can be achieved through human rights due diligence. One important aspect of this is the action after finding a risk at the workplace, leveraging the responsibility and actions, mitigating the risks, and remediation for the workers.[20] These intricacies in providing remediation for the problem of WSH cannot be addressed in the current framework. Women undergoing harassment require essential services, which include health care and justice. While the IC at the workplace, if functioning effectively, can address the justice, safety, and protection of women, revictimization should be avoided by survivor-centered services to break recurring cycles of violence.[21] Women undergoing harassment have complex and diverse needs, and the structural inequalities that underpin violence can compound the vulnerabilities. This can be better understood by using an intersectional lens to understand how various oppressions and experiences of discrimination can act together to worsen the consequences and occurrences of WSH in a vulnerable woman. Gender equality and social justice approaches at the workplace have transformative potential to improve the health of women holistically.[22] The first line of support a health care worker at the workplace can provide for a woman undergoing violence is LIVES, which is Listening with empathy and no judgment, Inquiring about needs and concerns, Validating the experience of violence, Enhancing safety and Support to connect with services.[23] This should follow an intersectional approach to ensure there is an understanding that other inequalities due to gender, caste, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, disability, class, and other forms of discrimination can intersect to create distinct vulnerabilities and effects.[24] LIVES provision can be performed by a nurse, doctor, welfare officer, HR professional, or a trained layperson. This will provide psychological support for the women. Problem Management Plus, a scalable psychological intervention, which is a feasible version of cognitive behavioral therapy, can be delivered to promote mental health and psychological well-being and alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.[25] This training can be offered by mental health professionals to key employees at the workplace, and WSH, apart from most mental health issues, can be addressed at the primary prevention level at the workplace through this intervention. This can also establish referral networks to ensure women receive appropriate specialist mental health care. Healthy Activity Program, a 6–8 session behavioral activation with problem-solving aspects and activation of social support, can also be provided by lay counselors for cases of depression.[26,27] These types of programs can be planned by medical officers and employers with expert mental health professional guidance to promote the mental health of workers. Lay counselors or barefoot counselors generation at the workplace can also address common mental health issues at the workplace. To establish a violence-free workplace, freedom of association, regular trainings on WSH, anti-retaliation protections, and transparency in business should be ensured by employers.[28] Prevailing cultural norms encourage a culture of impunity around GBV, and this should be dismantled. Employers should build a work culture based on mutual respect and dignity, taking into account the patriarchal society, gender stereotypes, gender norms, rape culture, honor-shame culture, and everyday sexism.[29] A proactive effort should be undertaken by employers and key staff to unlearn unconscious biases in the field of gender. There should be no tolerance towards the objectification of women and unfair treatment of LGBTQI+ individuals at the workplace. Workplaces should have a code of conduct prohibiting sexual harassment and clearly display and convey the consequences to workers. Those workers reporting sexual harassment should be protected, and confidentiality should be ensured. More than 90% of the labor workforce in our country is involved in the informal economy engaged by socially, economically, and underprivileged communities. This economy is characterized by a lack of legal protection and social security benefits, and in many sectors like agriculture, ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist), Anganwadi workers under the health system, sex workers, domestic workers, waste handlers, construction workers under the informal economy, women are more involved. The formation of IC and the functioning of LC in the informal sector is a challenge. LCs receive complaints from the informal sector very rarely or never.[30] Dialogue with specific workers' organizations, civil society organizations, and self-help groups in ensuring effective implementation of the law and awareness campaigns should be conducted to ensure the protection of workers in the informal sector. The current strategy of the Sexual Harassment electronic Box (SHe-Box) provides single window access to all women irrespective of sector of work; however, the awareness regarding the same, increasing ways to access the same through more stakeholder engagement and community participation, should be promoted.[31] Popular and social media initiatives to gain momentum on sexual harassment, such as the #MeToo movement, are not accessible for women in the informal sector who are not empowered to break the silence.[32] In conclusion, women and LGBTQI+ individuals at the workplace should be protected from sexual harassment through legal measures, awareness generation through employers, and care and support, which can be provided by health care workers as well as by lay personnel. Regular audits and monitoring of cases of sexual harassment and the functioning of ICs, as well as LCs, should be conducted. Positive change in the work environment should be established through regular training and awareness sessions, clear remedial measures, and ensuring freedom of association.","['prevention', 'gender-based', 'violence', 'harassment', 'workplace', 'india']"
The Internet of Things: Ethics of Our Connectivity,2015,"Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.'Aldous Huxley, Brave New World.What does it mean to live in a world where our dependence on digital devices and hardware ecosystems is non-negotiable? As our lives get tied up in a world of machines, how do we balance, control, monitor and engage with the 'Internet of Things' (the different devices, hardware and appliances connected to the internet) in a manner that allows us to still feel in control?The digital devices we use, connect and interact with have become seamless parts of our day. Many of the processes and tasks they complete are invisible to us. Rarely do we need to take our digital devices and tools apart, or sit down and understand how they work or why they are working, and this growing disconnect between our own understanding and participation with the Internet of Things. There is a gap where we are becoming more and more sidelined; where we are no longer active but passive consumers.The Internet of Things is predictive and intelligent. An example would be the navigation system in your car, or when you type into Google search and it already assumes certain understandings. This dynamic will impact our world significantly, redefining organizations, work forces, how we function as economies and societies. In tandem, it will challenge our ethics, relationship and interactions with machines.The Internet of Things is a concrete outside force, which comes into play challenging our learning communities. One of the biggest shifts which has evolved from it is how the workplace is radically changing due to the adoption of new technologies and, more importantly, a break from traditional business models. Some examples are Air B and B and Uber, two popular companies with widely-used services/apps. There is now a surge of start-ups fuelled by the e-economy which are re-framing employment rules in the work place. A generation of students in schools today is entering a new work place being choreographed by these changes. The social contract of employment we have lived with is being turned upside down.Tools can now be emailed at a click of a button (Nasa emails spanner to space station @BBC) and constructed in the confines of our homes with a 3D printer. So how does that shift the dynamic of manufacturing and in tandem the role of design, location, innovation and production? As this develops we are seeing a re-framing of manufacturing, and it will not be about location but innovation, creativity, f lexibility and adaptability.The growing field of machine intelligence and the complex dynamics of the ethical implications are starting to challenge our own moral construct and the relationship between machines and humans. Shivon Zillis shares an interesting graphic on her blog (The Current State of Machine Intelligence) that delineates the companies and organizations involved in machine intelligence and the accelerated growth of areas unheard of a few years back. The growing investment tied to the development of machine intelligence, coupled with the field of 'learning machines' as described by Jeremy Howard's Tedtalk are ushering a science-fiction-like future that is actually being constructed today.These are just a few of the many new shifts changing our world and being unpacked before our eyes. A term that encapsulates these forces well is VUCA, an acronym for 'volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity' initially coined as a militar y term in the 1990s and now often used by companies and organizations engaging with various leadership frameworks.For many of us the convenience of a frictionless experience with our digital devices, tools, and environments is a huge plus. For this frictionless experience, many of us are willing to give up a level of our privacy to third parties. After all, a convenient and seamless experience is the key for users. Nowadays many of the actions, processes and uses we engage in on digital devices, tools, and environments are almost subconscious. …","['internet', 'things:', 'ethics', 'connectivity']"
Development Vectors of Effective Cooperation between Education Field Workers and Employers in the Training System of Library Specialists,2023,"The purpose of the article is to determine the vectors of building an effective interaction with employers in the system of higher library and information education. The methodology. Socio-communicative and system-structural approaches were applied, which made it possible to determine the directions and functions of communication links in the system of gradual library and information education, to prove the importance of strengthening the communication interaction in the “higher education institution — employer”, “student of higher education — employer”, “graduate of a higher education institution — employer” subsystems. Based on the application of sociological research methods (questionnaires and surveys, monitoring of the employment of graduates), the necessity of establishing comprehensive relations in the “student of higher library education program — employer-director of the library” system has been proved in order to form the general and professional competencies in applicants that are in demand at the labor market. The results. Based on the analysis of the modern pedagogical idea and the own years-long teaching experience, the issue of building an effective cooperation between higher education institutions and employers was considered for the first time. Emphasis is placed on the translation of “student-teacher” academic communication into future professional relations of “graduate — employer”. A systematic approach to the organization of communication interaction between the graduate departments of KSAC in the specialty 029 “Information, library and archival affairs” and employers is highlighted, which involves various formats, methods, ways and technologies of communication interaction of all stakeholders in the quality training of library personnel (students of higher library education, scientific — pedagogical staff, graduates, heads of library institutions), aimed at the requirements of the modern labor market. Based on the results of a survey within the directors of libraries of Kharkiv and Kharkiv region, the qualities of graduates of KSAC prioritized by employers were determined, and their rating was the following: professional knowledge (89%), mastery of modern ICT (87%), reader orientation (56%), sociability (55%), creativity (46%), responsibility and reliability (35%), leadership (34%), organizational skills (32%), speech culture (26%), appearance (21%). The effectiveness of the implementation of employment monitoring, involvement of employers into teaching, review of educational programs and qualification works of students, participation in final assessment, has been proven. The scientific topicality. The sociological study “A graduate in the eyes of an employer” carried out by the Department of Digital Communications and Information Research of KSAC revealed two key problems that affect the effectiveness of communication interaction in the “graduate — employer” system: 1) graduates easily use digital technologies — digital skills, but have weaker communication technologies (communication skills), standards of business communication, which inhibits their professional adaptation; 2) the culture of academic communication “student — teacher” is translated into professional interaction “graduate — employer”, which forms behavioral models of future librarians already at the student desk. This requires the strengthening of systematic cooperation between higher education institutions and leading employees of information structures, libraries, archives, museums and other document and communication institutions of society. The ways of improving of the communication patterns of students, teachers and employers, strengthening of their interaction, partnership and responsibility have been determined. It was revealed that all stakeholders involved into the training and refresher course of the new generation of library and information personnel look toward to close communication in order to improve the professional and personal qualities of graduates, their competitiveness at the modern labor market, and quick adaptation to the requirements of the library industry and to a specific workplace. The practical significance. The results of the study can be used by Ukrainian institutions of higher education in the process of improving educational programs for training specialists in the specialty 029 Information, library and archival affairs, as well as to increase the effectiveness of cooperation with employers in all possible areas of communication interaction in the system of training of library specialists of all educational degrees, which will contribute to increasing their competitiveness at the global information market.","['development', 'vectors', 'effective', 'cooperation', 'between', 'education', 'field', 'workers', 'employers', 'training', 'system', 'library', 'specialists']"
Are you ready for disruption?,2019,"A disruptive innovation is one that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market-leading firms, products and alliances. Does this sound familiar? It should because it means is that what we were doing 1 year, 5 years or 10 years ago has been disrupted, replaced and is in danger of becoming obsolete. Disruptive technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries or businesses operate. A disruptive technology or protocol sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior. Recent disruptive technology examples include e-commerce, online news sites, ride-sharing apps and GPS systems. In dentistry, disruptive technologies could, amongst others, be considered as digital dentistry, digital workplace, online appointment scheduling, do-it-yourself dentistry and teledentistry. In years gone by dentistry was focussed on drilling, filling, crowns, extractions and denture fabrication as a way of ‘fixing’ dental problems. Current population statistics indicate that people are keeping their teeth for longer requiring a longer life span of dental fixing. Indeed there are many procedures available to repair damaged teeth, consisting mainly of fillings, crowns and implants. A reparative or fixing approach leads to a continuum of ongoing replacement dental procedures. This was once known as the ‘progression of dentistry’ – where a filling gets replaced with a bigger filling, which then turns into the tooth needing a root canal, then the tooth is weakened needs a crown, then the root canal fails and it needs an extraction, then an implant to replace it, which then fails and then we are unsure what follows next! Unfortunately, there is nothing ‘progressive’ about this approach at all and in fact it is regressive and reactive rather than progressive and proactive. This ‘fix-it’ approach has no regard for the cause of the problem or the patient as a whole. Fortunately dentistry is undergoing a huge paradigm shift in how oral health is managed and this will become a disruptive development in dentistry. For example new scientific and technological advances will bring about a significant paradigm shift from a tooth and gum fixing approach to a biological and patient-centred approach that recognizes and embraces patients’ health behaviours and beliefs. In turn, this will encourage partnerships between the whole dental team and patients allowing open communication that empowers patients to make good self-care decisions. An achievable new and holistic standard of everyday prevention in oral health can be achieved through these advances and changes in thinking. This disruption to the delivery of contemporary dental and oral care to ensure optimal oral health will present challenges because the classic way that a dental practice makes money is by doing a new procedure. Disruption in dentistry will undoubtedly influence the way dental prevention and oral health care is delivered. Apps are being developed almost on a daily basis to empower individuals to take control of, and monitor, their health data. This in turn can be fed to the dental clinic for assessment and assist in ongoing preventive strategies as well as recall, maintenance and treatment needs. However, previous, and indeed existing practice models, do not always provide adequately for the incorporation of prevention strategies – they are still too focussed on ‘fixing the problem’ rather than trying to prevent it. Indeed many practices do not have an effective business model for prevention as a primary focus of their dental business (apart from the sales of toothpaste, mouthwash and oral health aids which clearly cannot cover the expenses of a dental practice). Of course the above is just one example of how disruption will affect dentistry. There is always need for a redesign of the system. Thus disruption to the practice models and processes for dentistry, as we currently know them, is inevitable if we are to embrace technological, scientific and sociological advances. Are you ready for the looming challenge of change?","['ready', 'disruption?']"
Programmatic approaches to achieving equity for women in anesthesiology,2022,"Key points Women anesthesiologists can experience barriers and bias in the workplace, which varies in nature across their career and can negatively hinder professional development. Mitigation of these barriers and discrimination can be achieved through: (1) addressing individual bias, (2) closing the knowledge gap on the scope of bias, (3) deliberate representation, (4) strengthening professional networks, and (5) organized efforts to create policies that address gender inequity in the workplace. Women in anesthesiology is one example of several organized initiatives and programs that promote gender equity for women anesthesiologists of all identities. Introduction Women have long fought for equity in medicine and to be treated respectfully and professionally as physicians. One hundred seventy-five years ago, Elizabeth Blackwell was admitted to medical school as a joke, and since then, the viewpoint that medicine is emotionally undesirable, intellectually taxing, and physically draining for women has persisted. Pioneering women anesthesiologists, including Isabella Herb and Virginia Apgar, were discouraged from training as surgeons and pushed into the lower paying and ""lower status"" specialty of anesthesiology. Despite 50 years since the passage of Title IV, a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program or activity that receives federal funding, and the fact that half of the medical students are women, there is still major attrition of women as they advance in anesthesiology residencies, careers, and leadership.1,2 Recent studies have attempted to examine the reasons for this inequity and bring awareness of the widespread discrimination and systemic bias affecting women anesthesiologists and their departure from medicine.1,3–8 Identifying as a woman in anesthesiology is multifaceted and nuanced. Women can be at different points in their professional careers and personal lives. This may be associated with a broad spectrum of identities, including but not limited to clinicians, academicians, activists, or advocates, as well as mothers, children, siblings, or partners. These identities also intersect with sexuality, race, ethnicity, culture, spirituality, and community. This diversity of lived experiences is why blanket assumptions about women anesthesiologists should be avoided. However, despite these varied identities, all women anesthesiologists are subject to institutional and cultural norms regarding gender. Therefore, the development of multiple initiatives and programs to promote gender equity for women anesthesiologists of all identities is paramount. In this article, we will review the scope of the gender problem in our specialty, discuss proposed strategies to enhance equity, and examine 1 organization's approach to advocating for gender equity in anesthesiology. Scope of the problem Overworked, undervalued, harassed, and silenced. These are the sentiments of many women in anesthesiology. Many of the challenges encountered are synergized by a climate and culture that enable and fail to adequately address these issues.9 Gender disparities within anesthesiology exist because of systemic barriers and biases, limited number of women in anesthesiology leadership, and limited mentorship.5 The proportion of women physicians in anesthesiology ranks in the lower third among all medical specialties.10 Despite significant advances in the number of women entering medicine over the last few decades, anesthesiology programs have yet to achieve gender parity.7 Among anesthesiology residents, 33% are women. Women represent 25% of the overall anesthesiology workforce and 37% of the academic anesthesiology workforce, and these numbers remain relatively static.1,6,8 Meanwhile, other surgical and procedural subspecialties have doubled and tripled the percentage of women in their field and surpassed anesthesiology. Women anesthesiologists also are underrepresented in various positions of leadership or influence, and as authors and editors.4 They are paid significantly less than their male counterparts for equitable work, with an annual pay gap of 8%, or $32,000 a year, and are overall more likely to be in a lower salary range.5 Over a 30-year career span, this translates to roughly $1,000,000 in lost earnings.5 Even after adjusting for age, work experience, hours worked, academic productivity, and rank, the gap in gender pay remained and in fact, widened over the course of an anesthesiologist's career.5 There are several systemic issues that hinder the recruitment, retention, and success of women in anesthesiology. Women physicians, relative to men, encounter additional hurdles to performing their jobs, especially at the early stages of their careers.11 Women physicians are more frequently asked about their age and experience compared with their men counterparts. A study found when treatment advice was given by an inexperienced physician, and participants reported relying significantly more on the advice of a man versus a woman.11 This suggests that some of the hurdles that women physicians face are rooted in the psychological biases of others rather than objective features of cases or treatment settings.11 The results of the few studies examining the effects of gender on daily practice in the specialty of anesthesiology are discouraging. A recent survey study assessing gender disparities perceived by women anesthesiologists found that majority (90%) of the respondents felt that women in medicine need to work harder than men to achieve the same career goals, and sexual harassment was experienced by 55%.12 Similarly, in a survey of women cardiothoracic anesthesiologists, 24% of respondents reported experiencing unwanted physical or sexual advances, and 45% reported experiencing verbal harassment.13 The majority of respondents also reported experiencing intimidation or derogatory language in the workplace.13 As well stated by the authors: ""lack of psychological safety and respect in working environments increases the risk of communication failures, and intimidation in the setting of managing surgical patients increases stress and risk for burnout"".13 The original ""pipeline theory"" proposed that sex-based discrimination in academic medicine would diminish once women achieved a critical mass of > 30% of the academic workforce.14 Interestingly, ""women who examine trends in sex disparities in the workplace are often ridiculed, labeled as whining, or determined to be less capable in their ability to lead.""15 Paired with that, women physicians are less likely to be addressed as ""doctor,"" they are more likely to be interrupted (at times in the middle of their preoperative assessment), and more likely to be labeled as ""bossy"" when asserting information.16 The culture of medicine is unlikely to change without improving formal reporting mechanisms of sex-based discrimination and sexual harassment.14 Unfortunately, the prevalence of sexist microaggressions against women anesthesiologists is still high, and this ongoing workplace mistreatment can cause chronic and severe distress.17 Sex equity is an issue of urgency in the practice of anesthesiology. Those in leadership positions have the additional responsibility of leveraging their power to influence the broader institutional culture.15 Having women at the top of organizations has been shown to improve organizational performance.18 Women represent approximately half of students entering medical school and ~41% of full-time academic faculty,19 yet women constitute a minority of leaders.20 Sex disparities continue to exist at the upper levels of leadership in academic anesthesiology.1 Only 18% of women are professors, and the percentage of women anesthesiology department chairs remains unchanged from 2006 to 2016 (12.7% vs. 14%).21 As of this writing, neither Anesthesia & Analgesia nor Anesthesiology has had a woman Editor-in-Chief. On that note, men and women have significant differences in measures of publication productivity, a recent study demonstrating that male anesthesiologists had a higher h-index, number of publications, and number of citations.22 Women have also been underrepresented in national meetings with fewer speaker opportunities.8 Overall, the extremely limited proportion of women professors and chairs in anesthesiology, presidents of professional societies, and senior editors of specialty journals speak for itself when it comes to a lack of visibility at the highest level of the specialty.9 Despite the many barriers that women experience, they are just as eager as men to assume leadership positions.23 The ""glass ceiling"" still exists within the culture of anesthesiology, benefiting the ""masculine"" attitudes in the competition for academic positions.24 We need to change this outdated culture and climate in anesthesiology and create and help elevate more women into a pathway of equity. Anesthesiologists and pregnancy Pregnancy and motherhood have a tremendous impact on sex discrimination in anesthesiology. A woman's peak fertility often coincides with residency training and early career, a time when one's career trajectory becomes established. This is also the time when the sex gap in academic promotion and productivity widens. Having children at that time is a challenge, and it is known that work demands adversely affect women anesthesiologists' desired number of children and the desired age of childbearing. Anesthesiologists have the highest rate of maternal discrimination among all medical specialties.25 Sixty percent of anesthesiology residents reported a negative stigma around being pregnant and having children during training, and about half of trainees reported feeling discouraged from becoming pregnant or breastfeeding during training.7,26,27 Difficulties faced by women who are pregnant during training include inadequate maternity leave, insufficient access to lactation facilities at work, and negative culture surrounding pregnancy during training.26 Because of obstacles pertaining to motherhood, 1 in 10 female anesthesiologists would counsel a student against a career in anesthesiology.7 However, 86.2% of women anesthesiologists indicated that if given a choice again, they would still have their child during training despite these obstacles.26 Given the negative stigma associated with pregnancy in residency training, many women delay pregnancy until their early career, which typically occurs in the early 30s, leading to a higher likelihood of infertility.28 Approximately one-fourth of American female physicians are diagnosed with infertility at almost 34 years old, with a third of those due to diminished ovarian reserve, and this rate is significantly higher than the general population and other professionals that pursued higher education and careers.28,29 Contributing factors to the high rate of infertility among women in medicine may include stressors intrinsic to training, long hours, and night shifts.29 Infertility can lead to substantial depression, anxiety, burnout, and family planning regrets.28,29 Compounding the physical and emotional challenges of infertility is the exorbitant financial burden of treatment.29 In the United States, in vitro fertilization (IVF) costs ~$15,000 per round of treatment, not including the cost of medication.29 Unfortunately, fertility coverage for the majority of health professionals is lacking, and many medical institutions provide limited fertility coverage that will cover ~1 to 2 IVF cycles.29 In comparison, companies in the business, technology, and social media sector are recognizing the growing need for fertility coverage and are offering more comprehensive fertility, adoption, and surrogacy coverage, which has promoted physical and emotional well-being, job satisfaction, and enhanced employee recruitment and retention.29,30 In addition to cost, time is an additional barrier for seeking fertility treatment for anesthesiologists, and schedule modifications are often necessary. IVF typically requires the patient to present for multiple in-person monitoring appointments over a 2-week period during ovarian stimulation. On the basis of the outcome of the monitoring, an egg retrieval may be scheduled imminently, with little room for flexibility in timing. Without accommodation, women may need to take a vacation, paid or unpaid time off to undergo treatment, worsening the financial strain of infertility. Women anesthesiologists are also more likely to have pregnancy complications and miscarriages than the general population.31 Data suggests that women who work in the operating room have a higher incidence of first-trimester spontaneous abortions or a higher risk of birth defects.31 Women anesthesiologists report a higher rate of pregnancy complications [premature labor (8.8%), bedrest (7.8%), preeclampsia (6.5%), and a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay for the baby (5.7%)], negative stigma for taking time off for pregnancy complications, and guilt in burdening colleagues with increased shifts and calls.26 Many attending anesthesiologists do not receive a modified work schedule during pregnancy.27 In some practice models, time off for pregnancy complications may not be paid and may decrease time for parental leave. Parental leave is an essential component to achieving postpartum physical and mental health and is crucial for infant bonding. For trainees in 2018, average parental leave was reported as 8.9 (±7.4) weeks and a median of 6 weeks.26,27 Most training programs did not have a formal maternity leave policy, so trainees utilized a combination of vacation and sick days for leave.26 Approximately 60% of anesthesiology residents felt their maternity leave was inadequate, felt discouraged from taking more time off, and felt guilty of overburdening co-trainees with extra responsibilities while on leave.26 However, 86.1% of trainees also describe their programs as accommodating in terms of maternity leave flexibility.26 In 2018, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) issued a Statement on Personal Leave, which supported paid parental leave for 6 weeks after birth or adoption of a child.32 In 2019, the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) altered its absence from the Training Policy, which allowed residents to petition for an additional 40 days of leave without extending training.33 In 2021, the American Board of Medical supplies (ABMS) followed suit and instituted a parental leave policy, which calls for all member boards to allow 6 weeks of parental leave, outside of vacation time, for parental leave, without extending training.34 Mothers who delivered as attending anesthesiologists report an average parental leave time of 10.4 weeks (±3.5 wk) and a median of 12 weeks.27 Depending on the practice model, maternity leave may be composed of a combination of vacation and sick time, making prolonged leave financially untenable. This is in stark contrast to other fields, such as finance, tech, and entertainment that have made significant strides in paid parental leave, with companies offering up to 24 weeks of paid leave.35 Furthermore, unlike other fields, women anesthesiologists cannot work remotely postpartum to ease the transition back to work and face the added challenge of maintaining lactation in the perioperative setting. Physicians initiate breastfeeding at a higher rate than the general population; however, they have a lower continuance rate by infant age 6 months. Half of the anesthesiologist mothers report meeting the desired breastfeeding duration and having adequate, convenient lactation facilities.26,27 In addition, sufficient break time and lack of adequate relief can make it difficult to pump.26,27 Although there are wearable breast pumps that are becoming more popular, they may not work for all women. Recently the ASA has adopted a Statement on Lactation Among Anesthesia Clinicians in 2021 to support lactation accommodations in the perioperative environment.36 Inequitable distribution of domestic duties Along with the demands of work, women anesthesiologists face the added burden of inequitable distribution of domestic duties. Regardless of marital status or motherhood, women physicians spend an average of 8.5 more hours per week on household duties, are more likely to be the primary caregiver for children or the elderly, and are less likely to have a stay-at-home partner.10,37,38 In addition to the visible household responsibilities, women bear the invisible and unlimited mental load in 3 overlapping categories.39,40 Cognitive labor involves thinking about the practical elements of household responsibilities (ie, shopping lists, and organizing activities).39 Emotional labor focuses on maintaining the family's emotional well-being (ie, worrying about kids in school, and managing child's behavior).39 Mental load is the intersection of cognitive and emotional labor and is sometimes referred to as the ""third shift,"" in ""running the business of the family.""39,40 The COVID-19 pandemic brought these inequities to the forefront by highlighting the work-life imbalance native to the culture of medicine and in the United States. In the initial stages of the pandemic, some anesthesiologists were furloughed on unpaid leave of absence, while others voluntarily decreased work hours because of increased caregiving responsibilities at home.10,41 A survey from the California Society of Anesthesiologists at the time revealed that women anesthesiologists were furloughed or given involuntary vacation more often than men.42 For those women who did continue working on the frontlines, they confronted an unprecedented ethical and moral dilemma, as there was much unknown about the severity of the virus. They were torn between dedication to the profession and the urge to protect their families from both the novel disease and the possibility of leaving their young children as orphans.43–46 As a result, more women anesthesiologists, particularly junior faculty, reduced work hours, transitioned to part-time work, and contemplated leaving medicine altogether.43,47,48 In addition, with school closures and a focus on remote learning, many women used their nonclinical time to focus on domestic duties and childcare, contributing an average of 15 more hours per week than fathers on household tasks and resulting in a 33% decline in research hours and academic productivity as compared with men.43,47,49–51 The percentage of articles with women as first authors decreased during the early stages of the pandemic, despite the surge of COVID-19-related publications published in high-impact journals, further widening the sex gap in academic productivity.52,53 Networking opportunities, crucial for academic promotion, were also decreased for women physicians as conferences became virtual and there was reduced time for attendance, either because of personal responsibilities or institutional cost-cutting measures.54 While the virtual environment did provide the flexibility to perform administrative duties from home, the prevalence of multitasking, interruptions, and extended workday availability also increased.10,50 Overall, the pandemic placed an increased burden on women anesthesiologists struggling to balance the increasing family and household obligations with work-related responsibilities and broadened the sex gap in academic productivity and promotion.10,44 Proposed strategies to enhance gender equity in anesthesiology To outline strategies to achieve gender equity in our profession, we researched recommended solutions to gender equity in national55 and international policies 56 and in business and medical literature.3,57–66 The common themes in all areas indicate that the road to achieving sex equity in our profession is lengthy and is more than simply equipping women with skill-building and leadership training. However, we believe that systemic change can be achieved by following 5 tenets, which were present in all the literature we examined: (1) addressing individual bias, (2) closing the knowledge gap on the scope of bias, (3) deliberate representation, (4) strengthening professional networks, and (5) organized efforts to create policies that address gender inequity in the workplace. Addressing individual bias To begin to create a culture of acceptance in a group, practice, institution, or profession, regular and required training in diversity, equity, and inclusion principles is necessary to first address individual bias. Diversity, equity, and inclusion training and education can cover a wide range of systemic topics related to sex, such as implicit bias, harassment, and sexism, and can be presented in a variety of formats, from individual e-learning to large-format conferences like Grand Rounds. There are numerous organizations that provide training, and free resources such as webinars, podcasts, and videos are widely available. Educational efforts must lead to the adoption of policies and leadership that support women in the workplace, should allow gender equity to be a consistent part of the conversation, and should result in the integration of sex equity into organizational missions, visions, and values. Closing the knowledge gap on the scope of bias Institutional needs assessments should be regularly conducted and publicly reported to understand the current status of women anesthesiologists, identify barriers to their advancement, and propose systemic solutions. Data collection could include performing audits of demographics (of committees, speakers, authors, reviewers, editors, award nominees, etc.), compensation, and professional effort. Institutions need to be transparent about how professional effort is calculated and compensated among education, research, administration, and clinical care. Benchmarks should be consulted and applied to metrics consistently, and goal targets should be set. Deliberate representation There needs to be deliberate and targeted representation of women in recruitment, retention, promotion processes, and in leadership. Purposefully including women and their perspectives in any process where decisions or policies are made that affect work culture is imperative. Sex-diverse candidates should always be nominated or considered. ""More than 1"" (the idea that if more than 1 woman is considered, there is a higher likelihood that a woman will achieve a position) has been adopted in diversity pledges by the National Institutes of Health and Lancet, which commits to enhancing the representation of women. Developing additional strategies to enhance representation should start by thinking outside the traditional job description of an anesthesiologist and should emphasize equity rather than equality. Accommodating flexibility and choice is key. Nontraditional scheduling 67 leave policies with long-term job security and support for workplace reentry, valuation of citizenship tasks for promotion, and other childcare and family-friendly policies should be considered to enhance the representation of women anesthesiologists at all levels. There should be zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, and sex-based violence. Strengthening professional networks Much focus has been placed on the mentorship of women, but there are other ""-ships"" that are as important, including sponsorship and allyship. Sponsors and allies help to showcase women and ensure their contributions are recognized and rewarded. They can amplify and promote women, their ideas, and their experience, ultimately enhancing the woman's voice. Networking is important for the establishment of sponsorship and allyship. Social media has greatly increased the visibility of women anesthesiologists and has allowed connections without the traditional travel to in-person conferences and meetings. However, deliberate networking events, whether formal or informal, are also known helpful interventions. Professional development programming and leadership training for women that focus on relational skills and increasing visibility can assist with enhancing networking. Organized efforts to create policies that address sex inequity in the workplace It is necessary to acknowledge that there are specific challenges related to a gender's sex and the stereotyped gender roles that are engrained in workplace culture. Women are known as caregivers, and the acceptance of caregiving roles outside of a clinical context is imperative. Specific benefits for reproductive support, childcare support, lactation support, domestic service support, and elder care support provided by the workplace ensure that caregiving is valued and enhance well-being. It is vital to make the workplace a more functional place for women anesthesiologists. Policies to ensure women are not penalized on the promotion and advancement tracks should be enacted. In addition, organized efforts to provide professional development, leadership training, and networking for women anesthesiologists at the local, regional, and national levels are essential. This includes specific programming not only to enhance the skillsets of women but also to help women navigate and address the systemic issues they encounter in a variety of settings. Organizational efforts: an example Numerous organizations have been established that are dedicated to improving equity for women anesthesiologists. These include national organizations (Women in Anesthesiology), committees and special interest groups of the anesthesiology organizations (American Society of Anesthesiologists Committee on Women Anesthesiologists, Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists' Women in Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Women in Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Special Interest Group, and Society for Critical Care Medicine Women in Critical Care Knowledge Education Group), and leadership development resources and programming (Society for Pediatric Anesthesiology Women's Empowerment and Leadership Initiative, Women of Impact in Anesthesiology podcast, Alpha Women of Anesthesiology podcast). A variety of programs indicates that there is enough overlap and uniqueness to provide preferential professional development opportunities to each individual. To further discuss the organizational approach to gender equity in anesthesiology, we will focus on 1 society: Women in Anesthesiology (WIA). WIA is a volunteer-run, nonprofit physician organization, founded in 2015 by Dr Rekha Chandrabose, committed to the professional and personal development of women anesthesiologists. WIA's mission also supports the recruitment, retention, and job satisfaction of women in anesthesiology and promotes a culture of inclusivity and diversity. Dr Chandrabose personally faced numerous challenges navigating residency and early career as a mother without mentorship. With the support of a grant from the ASA Committee for Professional Diversity and modeled after other women physician groups [eg, FemInEm (Women Emergency Medicine Doctors), Association of Women Surgeons, Women in Ophthalmology), the organization was formed to provide a collective voice addressing systemic inequities. WIA's initial goals were focused on addressing 3 factors: (1) lack of professional respect in comparison with male peers, (2) conflict between personal and professional responsibilities, and (3) absence of adequate mentorship and sponsorship to promote women to leadership roles. Initial advocacy efforts largely embraced the use of social media to connect women across geography and demographics to provide education and virtual support networks to counteract the disrespect affecting women anesthesiologists. Continued efforts were largely driven by younger women in early and mid-career stages, who were experiencing the pinch of work-life integration. Deliberate work for representation in leadership roles across organizations, societies, and institutions was pursued through publicity regarding open positions, enhanced recommendations and nominations of women for positions, and education regarding the benefits of having women in leadership roles. As a small organization not associated with a larger society, WIA's grassroot efforts are highly advantageous in driving systemic change in other anesthesiology organizations. Early work, through social media and email campaigns, resulted in the establishment of accommodations for mothers and families at society meetings. More concentrated efforts by members of the WIA Board of Directors have impacted national leave of absence and lactation policy changes in both the ASA and ABA. For example, both the ASA Statement on Personal Leave32 and the ASA Statement on Lactation36 were initiated by WIA leaders, who held roles in vital ASA committees. The independent nature of WIA also allows for swift statements on current social and public health issues relevant to anesthesiologists, including racism, gun violence, and reproductive healthcare. WIA encourages continued advocacy on these issues by providing resources and action plans for its members to become more engaged in efforts that are important to them. In addition to advocacy, WIA provides numerous professional development opportunities for women and men anesthesiologists. Educational programming through an Annual Meeting and a Virtual Speaker Series showcases women anesthesiologists as national speakers and provides members exposure to topics, such as the second victim effect, imposter phenomenon, speaking up, developing a digital presence, resilience, and opportunities outside the operating room. Free webinars have presented renowned experts on how to give effective presentations or write publishable papers. In addition, regular communications through a newsletter, social media, and toolkits on the WIA website provide timely updates on topics relevant to women anesthesiologists. The accomplishments of members are celebrated through these communications and annual awards, including the Distinguished Service Award and Champion Award. Networking and connection on local levels are facilitated by Chapter Liaisons and a yearly in-person gathering before the ASA Annual Meeting. However, as a volunteer-run group of full-time working women physicians, balancing their own careers and personal obligations, 1 of the largest pitfalls has been finding the resources (financial and time) to maintain a continual and up-to-date presence for our members. Although there have been many victories associated with the rapid growth and development of WIA, 1 of the most notable is the recent establishment of a WIA Medical Student Component (MSC). It is well known that anesthesiology has remained behind other specialties in the recruitment of women to the field. While certainly multifactorial, it would surprise most anesthesiologists that women medical students are more likely to choose a surgical subspecialty than anesthesiology as a career. The WIA-MSC received a recent grant from the ASA Committee on Professional Diversity to fund a pipeline program aimed at empowering students to learn about anesthesiology, address the unique challenges that young women anesthesiologists face, and provide a national network for longitudinal connections starting from students' first year in medical school. Notably, the MSC's student leaders are largely women of color, and their drive for mentorship, sponsorship, and representation will help to improve the future diversity of our specialty. WIA has bright prospects on the horizon. Current member-driven initiatives include curating a Lactation Best Practices document for all practice types, a professional opportunity database, and an in-person continuing medical education conference. In addition, WIA will continue to invest in medical students and young physicians by establishing mentorship programs and a resident section. The organization has led great improvements for women in its short history but recognizes that there is still much work to be done. Although ""women"" is in the name of the organization, WIA strives to be inclusive of all sexes and aims to improve advocacy for intersectional identities. In addition, much of our work has resulted in recommendations for change in key universal areas (respect, mentorship/sponsorship, parenthood, work-life balance), but true culture change is needed by action at the group and institutional levels. The tools provided by WIA and other similar organizations aimed at promoting sex equity provides a variety of ways to put recommendations into action and to encourage a systemic approach to dismantle ingrained modes of discrimination. Conclusion Despite pipeline numbers improving, there is still major attrition of women in anesthesiology as they advance in their careers. Sex disparities within anesthesiology exist because of numerous systemic barriers and biases, along with discordance in cultural norms related to sex, which results in many women anesthesiologists feeling disrespect, doubt, and discrimination from their profession. Simply equipping women anesthesiologists with skill-building and leadership training is inadequate to address this problem. Numerous surveys and studies support the need for systemic change to address inequity through strategies, such as education, data collection, enhanced representation, and sponsorship. Organizations, such as Women in Anesthesiology and other initiatives, dedicated to promoting equity for women anesthesiologists of all identities are paramount. Conflict of interest disclosure The authors declare that they have nothing to disclose.","['programmatic', 'approaches', 'achieving', 'equity', 'women', 'anesthesiology']"

Clinical Research in the National Football League,2020,"Introduction Sport is an international obsession for many people. Ensuring that athletes can compete in as safe of an environment as possible is vital not only in terms of the players' individual health and the teams' success in competition but also serves as a point of public health impact and as an example to young athletes. Sports injury surveillance and player health research is an essential component of injury prevention, reduction, and ultimately, player wellness. The National Football League (NFL) has established a robust injury research structure across all facets of athlete health (1,2). Consistent with established ethical principles and good practice for medical research, the NFL and NFL Players Association (NFLPA) jointly developed a Player Scientific and Medical Research Protocol Approval Process (MRAP) through which NFL player electronic injury and illness data may be used for the purposes of observational and interventional research. MRAP was agreed to by the NFL and NFLPA as a side letter agreement to the 2011 NFL-NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), dated January 26, 2015, and has been updated over time. This process provides oversight of the access, utilization, and management of NFL health data to: 1) ensure that the potential research is feasible, valuable, and methodologically sound; (2) protect the confidentiality interests of NFL players and assure that appropriate personal information is not released to the public; and 3) avoid the duplication of research efforts between the NFL's medical committees, with the overall goal of ensuring that the goals of the intended research are consistent with the interests of the patient (player) and institution (NFL). The establishment of this process acknowledges the sensitivity of the workplace injury and illness data shared by NFL athletes, as well as the value of these data toward driving actionable evidence for injury prevention and player care. While these are supremely fit, talented young men, they are at risk for sustaining significant injuries and developing medical conditions throughout their time playing football — both at amateur and professional levels — based on the inherent risks associated with American football. Collaborative development of MRAP by the NFL and NFLPA ensures that both the League and the player representatives agree to the principles of conducting research on these ""player-patients"" with the goal of understanding and improving health and safety in a sound and ethical fashion within a collectively bargained employment environment. The steps within the application process and various levels of approval required to conduct research using NFL player workplace injury and illness data are defined in the MRAP protocol. The level of approval is based on whether the research is: 1) active (interventional) or observational (noninterventional); 2) the intended use of the data; and 3) the sensitivity of the requested data. Sequential approvals by each party in the process are required; denial at any point by either party results in the full request being denied. Additionally, MRAP establishes a process whereby a research product (e.g., manuscript, presentation) is submitted for approval prior to submission for public presentation or editorial review and subsequent dissemination. However, it is stated explicitly in the MRAP protocol that ""the NFL and NFLPA may offer nonbinding comments but shall not have editorial control or input"" into any scientific publication or professional presentation. This caveat applies to all types of research disseminated via the MRAP governance structure. Player-related research approved through MRAP is based on data that are collected directly on active players by NFL team medical staff or NFL team medical/scientific consultants, rather than data compiled and promoted by external public or private sources. Data pertaining to prospective players evaluated at the National Invitational Scouting Combine who do not sign an NFL contract are not eligible for use in MRAP research. This approach ensures that the medical research data obtained from NFL players and its subsequent analyses and interpretation are as consistent and accurate as possible, particularly with regard to completeness, injury classification, and diagnosis. Studies describing the incidence of, and prognostic implications following specific injuries among NFL players have recently been published (3–23); these studies are most frequently based on convenience samples obtained from publicly reported sources, such as the lay press or dedicated web logs (blogs), which may be inaccurate and incomplete, and are likely to reflect more severe injuries or the experiences of more popular players. Use of a comprehensive, curated electronic medical record-based injury system linked with official game statistics, player demographics, and injury mechanisms provides the most reliable and robust data. Such data are necessary to capture accurate injury statistics, which are essential for impact assessment of these injuries. Every NFL club is responsible for distributing this MRAP protocol to its medical team. Club research requests for approval may only be submitted by the club's head team orthopedist, head team medical physician, or head team athletic trainer (AT). Requests to undertake research also may come from an NFL club or a member or consultant of the NFL's Medical Committees (24) (e.g., health and safety, musculoskeletal, head, neck and spine, general medical). Failure to obtain the requisite approvals prior to initiating a research project or disseminating NFL player injury data will result in removal of the responsible member from their respective committee and/or sanctions to the club at the discretion of the NFL Commissioner. The purposes of this article are to outline the MRAP governance structure (which explains the details of the medical research processes in the NFL) and highlight the importance of a structured, multilevel research approval process in a professional sport league whose injury and illness data are governed by a collectively bargained agreement. MRAP Protocol Components and Resources There are two components to the MRAP governance structure: 1) The MRAP Protocol details the process for seven distinct pathways of approval based on the (a) person requesting data, (b) intent of research (i.e., publication/external presentation vs. occupational/internal club, league or committee use), and (c) sensitivity/identifiability of data requested (Table 1). 2) Initial request form through which applications are initiated, designated by MRAP as Appendix A (Supplemental Digital Content 1, https://links.lww.com/CSMR/A47). This form requires disclosure of the study objectives, the data being requested, identification of the intended audience, and intended use of the data. Table 1: Research pathways and approved dissemination of NFL medical research.Based on the information submitted in the initial request form, the research proposal request is assigned to one of the seven pathways outlined within the MRAP protocol, which specifies the sequential reviews and approvals required for the request. All requests are made via a dedicated web site and reviewed by an independent third-party research company (IQVIA, Durham, NC) specializing in health information technology, analytics, and clinical research. The initial request initiates a feasibility review to assess whether: 1) data are available for the requested research; and 2) the research methodology is scientifically valid. Each approval party then reviews the proposal with consideration toward the strength of the scientific aims, availability and sensitivity of the data being requested, relative importance of the research objectives, and whether there is overlapping research underway by one of the NFL's medical committees and advisors. MRAP Protocol The MRAP protocol contains seven pathways of approval for research activity, each with specific, sequential requirements. These are detailed below, and the language is taken nearly verbatim from the NFL-NFLPA CBA side letter agreement. I. Active/Interventional Player Research Club-related or third-party request to conduct ""active"" or interventional research on an NFL player or players (e.g., conducting diagnostic tests for the purpose of gathering data rather than as clinically or medically indicated; circulating questionnaires or interviewing players directly; or administering any form of medication and/or blood testing for the purpose of research rather than as clinically or medically indicated). Process Once an interventional research project obtains the approval of the relevant NFL medical committee, that committee designates one of its members to serve as the ""sponsor"" of the research project. The project sponsor is responsible for monitoring the progress of the research and periodically reporting back to the larger committee. The project sponsor serves as the liaison between the researcher and the NFL for any logistical issues. Data or analysis may be shared per NFL and NFLPA determination provided: 1) institutional review board (IRB) approval is attained and current; 2) player privacy concerns are addressed with prior notice to and approval as set forth above by the NFL, NFLPA, and relevant medical committee(s); and 3) notification and dissemination of findings and reports to aforementioned parties is provided 60 d prior to submission for publication and 30 d prior to publication (final article upon acceptance). Player participation in any research project must be and remain entirely voluntary. Players retain the right to withdraw their consent at any time and no longer participate in the research project. Prior to publication or presentation of results, the researcher must send a draft of the report or manuscript regarding the study to the NFL (NFL chief medical officer and NFL management council legal) and the NFLPA to ensure that any player privacy concerns are appropriately addressed. This must occur 60 d prior to submission and 30 d prior to publication (final article upon acceptance) and applies to any abstracts or presentation given or submitted based on the research. As mentioned previously, the NFL and NFLPA may only offer nonbinding comments and has neither editorial control nor input. If an NFL club physician engages in active or interventional player research without obtaining the requisite approvals described above, discipline may be imposed against the club with which that physician is affiliated. Other remedies also may be available to individual players and/or the NFLPA pursuant to the CBA. II NFL Club Physician EMR Data Request: Internal/Club Use Only Each NFL club may access the data related to its own players; clubs may not obtain identified data related to players in other clubs. Beginning in the 2019 season, individual NFL clubs have access to an injury dashboard showing injury incidence overall and by setting trends over time, and return to play metrics for players from their own club, as well as comparison with select aggregate results across the League. For many injuries and health-related conditions, NFL clubs can compare their injury/health condition data with league averages, which are provided to the club by IQVIA. Process Clubs may request analysis of their own player data by submitting the request form to IQVIA, which will comment on the feasibility and resources needed for the project. The requesting Club also must submit a proposal through the NFL MRAP web site. IQVIA's feasibility assessment, when applicable, and the request form will then be forwarded to NFL management council legal, the NFL chief medical officer and the NFL executive vice president (EVP) of Health and Safety Initiatives for approval. The project will pass through the approvals required as set forth within Table 2 via the NFL MRAP web site (https://legacy.nflfoundation.org/mrap/login). Please note that one cannot log in or view anything on the site unless they are provided with login information by the NFL. Projects will be approved and prioritized according to the complexity of the analysis and availability of resources. Data produced under this section may not be disclosed to anyone who is not affiliated with the club. In other words, a club medical team member may not use data produced under this research pathway in any publication or presentation to any audience outside of the club.Table 2: NFL medical research approval process summarya.III NFL Medical Committee Member: Internal Committee Use Only/De-Identified Data NFL medical committees shall be given access to deidentified player data in connection with their respective missions. Data produced via this research pathway may not be disclosed to anyone who is not affiliated with the relevant committee. In other words, an NFL medical committee member may not use data produced under this section in any publication or presentation to any audience outside of the committee, the NFL, or the NFLPA, absent appropriate approval. The NFL will give notice to the NFLPA legal of such a request and provide a copy of such data prior to sending the data to the requesting committee. In addition, a committee member or chairperson may request access to research results to consider for broader distribution to relevant NFL medical advisors by contacting the NFL chief medical officer and IQVIA. Should the committee member/chairperson conclude that the broader committee would benefit from distribution of the data, the protocol reflected in this research pathway shall apply. Process NFL medical committee members may request deidentified player analyses or data by submitting the request form to IQVIA, which will assess the feasibility and resources needed to perform the recommended project. The requesting NFL medical committee member also must submit a proposal through the NFL MRAP web site. IQVIA's assessment and the request form will then be forwarded to NFL management council legal, the NFL chief medical officer and the NFL executive vice president of Health and Safety Initiatives for approval. The project will pass through the approvals required as set forth within Table 3, via the NFL MRAP web site. Data produced under this section may not be disclosed to anyone who is not affiliated with the committee.Table 3: NFL MRAP approval parties by research pathway.IV NFL Medical Committee Member: Internal Committee Use Only — Identified or Identifiable Data NFL medical committees shall be given access to player data in connection with their respective missions. Identified or identifiable data may include the names of players or could be identifiable by virtue of the data set or information included (e.g., date of game, type of injury, position). These data may be requested by an individual NFL medical committee member for review by the larger committee or to identify potential issues. Process NFL medical committee members may request analysis of identified or identifiable player data by submitting a request to IQVIA, which will assess the feasibility and resources needed to perform the recommended project. The requesting NFL medical committee member also must submit a proposal through the NFL MRAP web site. IQVIA's assessment and the request form will then be forwarded to NFL management council legal, the NFL chief medical officer and the NFL executive vice president of Health and Safety Initiatives for approval. NFLPA legal also must consent to the production of these data. The project will pass through the approvals required as set forth within Table 3, via the NFL MRAP web site. Data produced under this section may not be disclosed to anyone who is not affiliated with the committee. In other words, an NFL medical committee member may not use data produced under this section in any publication or presentation to any audience outside of the committee. V NFL Club Physician/NFL Medical Committee Member: EMR Data Research — Publication/Public Disclosure Intended — De-identified, Identifiable, and Identified Data NFL club physicians (head orthopedic or head internal medicine physicians only), head club ATs, or members of NFL medical committees may request either their club-specific or league-wide data with the intent to publish the results. Process To obtain such data, the Head Club Physician/AT or NFL medical committee member must submit the request form through the NFL MRAP web site, which will direct the request to the NFL chief medical officer who will, upon approval, direct the request to the appropriate NFL medical committee chairperson. The committee will review all proposals to determine whether or not the proposal raises an issue of substantial relevance to the general NFL population and is worthy of the dedication of resources required to gather the data requested. If approved by the committee, IQVIA conducts analyses which ensure that the request is feasible and may request additional detail should it be required to evaluate the request. Upon approval of the relevant NFL medical committee, the request will be directed to the remaining parties for approval (Table 3). The final draft of the article or report must be presented to IQVIA and the relevant medical committee chairperson 60 d prior to submission and 30 d prior to publication (final article upon acceptance), and this requirement applies to any abstracts or presentation given or submitted based on the study. No submissions or presentations may occur until approvals are provided. The manuscript must be finalized within 24 months from the initial request date and IRB review must remain up-to-date for the full course of the project; updated approvals must be provided to IQVIA. International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines for review and authorship must be followed (25). VI NFL Club Physician/NFL Medical Committee Member: EMR Data Research — Publication/Public Disclosure Intended — Case Study NFL club physicians (head orthopedic and head internal medicine physicians only), club head ATs, or NFL medical committee members may request either their club-specific or league-wide identified player data, in furtherance of a specifically defined research project, with the intent to publish the results. Process To obtain such data, the head club physician/AT or committee member must submit the request through the NFL MRAP web site, which will direct the request through the required approvals, as set forth in Table 3. The submission to the NFL and NFLPA must include a proposed IRB-approved individual consent form for players whose data will be the subject of the research to execute. Upon approval from those entities, the proposal will be submitted to the IRB. Such submission to the IRB must include the IRB-approved proposed individual player consent form. Following approval of the IRB, the approved consent form must be used to obtain the consent of individual players whose identifiable data will be the subject of the research. Upon approval of the IRB and the individual player(s) whose identified data will be the subject of the research, the proposal shall be sent to the chairperson of the NFL Health and Safety Committee for designation to the appropriate NFL medical committee chairperson. The NFL medical committee chairperson will assign the project to a committee member for review and presentation to the committee. The committee will review all proposals to determine whether or not the proposal raises an issue of substantial relevance to the general NFL population and is worthy of the dedication of resources required to gather the data requested. If approved, the designated committee member shall be responsible for monitoring the project's progress and providing periodic updates to the committee. Data or analyses may be shared after approval from NFL and the NFLPA. The final draft of the article or report by which the results of the study will be publicly released must be presented to and approved by the designated committee member and NFL chief medical officer. This must occur 60 d prior to submission and 30 d prior to publication (final article upon acceptance) and applies to any abstracts or presentation given or submitted based on the study. As in all other MRAP-related research endeavors, the NFL and NFLPA can offer nonbinding comments but do not have editorial control or input. VII Research by Third Parties without NFL Affiliation Data Requests Pursuant to the terms of the collectively bargained NFL Data Management Policy, NFL player medical data will not ordinarily be available for third-party research, absent agreement by the NFL management council and NFLPA. Should the parties agree that a proposed research project presents a clear opportunity to enhance NFL players' health and safety and has not been duplicated by previous or ongoing NFL research, the parties may consent to the disclosure of NFL player data. In such an instance, the research project must, at a minimum, follow the steps outlined in Pathway III. Data or analysis may be shared after approval from NFL and NFLPA. Discussion The MRAP governance structure was devised to maintain high standards of research and appropriate use of sensitive data by structuring mutually agreed oversight of the use of NFL player workplace injury and illness data within clinical research. The goals of this process are to ensure that proposed research provides value to the NFL and its players, is feasible and methodologically sound, respects patient (player) confidentiality, and avoids the duplication of research efforts among the NFL's medical committees. Similar to typical American university or hospital-based IRBs and research governance systems in Europe and the rest of the world, MRAP serves to primarily protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects (the NFL players) while secondarily protecting the interests of the institution (the NFL). In general terms, IRBs and Research Ethics Committees (RECs) are charged with providing an independent evaluation that proposed research is ethically acceptable, devoid of investigator bias, and is compliant with regulations designed to protect human subjects. Such research governance bodies are given the authority to approve, require modifications to, or disapprove research activities undertaken in their institution or geographical setting, irrespective of the relative merit or purpose of the research. To accomplish this duty, IRBs and RECs often function through a committee format comprised of clinician-scientists, nonscientists, and often at least one layperson representing the perspective of the research subjects. Some research activities (e.g., patient surveys, existing data) are often designated as exempt from medical research governance approval processes because they pose ""minimal risk"" to human subjects. IRBs and RECs do not determine the relative value the research provides to the institution or to society and may not have detailed knowledge of the occupational and demographic risk factors of the patient population to be studied. The NFL and NFLPA MRAP governance structure adds additional layers of scientific oversight, all in the context of respecting the parameters of conducting scientific research in the context of a collectively bargained workforce. The seven distinct pathways of MRAP ensure that approvals specific to the use of the data and the risk the research poses to the players are attained. MRAP also assesses the merit and need for proposed research activities so as to avoid committing resources to studies whose objectives have limited clinical relevance to the NFL player population, have already been completed, or that cannot be performed in a robust, quality manner with the proposed methodology or available data. Because NFL players are members of a union, and MRAP has been collectively bargained, all NFL player research evaluated through this process must be approved by the players' bargaining representative, the NFLPA. The structure of MRAP enhances and augments the required evaluation performed by an independent IRB by requiring additional layers of oversight by both NFL and NFLPA medical advisors, legal representatives, and senior level administrators as well as experts in injury data analysis. In this way, all involved stakeholders — the players, NFL, and NFLPA — have their interests protected. This unique model can serve as a template for other nonmedical entities or organizations that may wish to perform clinical research that involves human subjects. An additional benefit of MRAP is the improved reliability of research data that is used either internally by each NFL club or made publicly available through peer-reviewed publications, academic conferences, or media releases. Multiple research studies (3–23) have been published in the medical literature that use Internet-based injury reports, press releases, and team web sites to obtain injury data in an effort to describe injury incidence or treatment outcomes. This practice can be problematic since there is no confirmation that the publicly reported data are accurate or complete. In some cases, the publicly collected injuries may closely match the data within the NFL's electronic medical record. However, the true incidence is unlikely to match perfectly and, in many cases, may differ meaningfully. For example, if the injury in question is of a lower grade that does not result in playing time lost, then this less severe injury may not be detected by these public data sources. As a result, lower-grade injuries will likely be underreported in publicly available data sources, leading to calculation of an erroneously low injury incidence and/or a subsequently inaccurate report of specific injury burden. Second, these public data sources may not report injuries that occur in players whose contracts are terminated and enter into Injury Settlements postinjury or who are on the practice squad. Finally, failure to account for each injury, especially less severe injuries that are not media-reported, also may lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding treatment outcomes when generalizing results to a specific injury. Since all NFL medical research is first approved through MRAP, the appropriate data set for the research question is able to be identified. Use of a comprehensive, curated EMR-based injury system linked with official game statistics, player demographics, and injury mechanisms provides the most reliable and valid data, and accessing these data through formal channels allows external researcher access for consultation on methodological use of the data, operational definitions of variables, understanding of limitations, and ultimately, appropriate interpretations. MRAP was uniquely developed through the mutual efforts of the NFL and NFLPA to enhance oversight of the access and utilization of NFL player electronic workplace injury and illness data for the purposes of regulating clinical research. By governing across all proposed research to ensure each project is unique, methodologically sound, and properly addresses confidentiality and privacy concerns, the protected interests of the patients (player) and institution (NFL) remain paramount to the goals of the intended research. MRAP has proved successful in achieving its aims and could be adapted for other sports and areas of similar sports medicine research interest.","['clinical', 'research', 'national', 'football', 'league']"
Your (Internet) Connection Is Unstable,2021,"It has been fifteen months since the World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the first lockdowns went into effect, dramatically changing the social landscape for millions of individuals worldwide. Overnight, it seemed, Zoom became the default platform for video conferencing, rapidly morphing from brand name to eponymous generic—a verb and a place and mode of being all at once. This nearly ubiquitous transition to remote work and remote play was both unprecedented and entirely anticipated. While teleworking, digital commerce, online learning, and social networking were common fare by 2020, in March of that year telepresence shifted from option to mandate, and Zooming became a daily practice for tens of millions of individuals worldwide. In an era of COVID-19, our relationships and experiences are deeply intertwined with our ability to “Zoom”. This shift resulted in new forms of artistic practice, new modes of pedagogy, and new ways of social organising, but it has also created new forms (and exacerbated existing forms) of exploitation, inequity, social isolation, and precarity. For millions, of course, lockdowns and restrictions had a profound impact that could not be mitigated by the mediated presence offered by way of Zoom and other video conferencing platforms. For those of us fortunate enough to maintain a paycheck and engage in work remotely, Zoom in part highlighted the degree to which a network logic already governed our work and our labour within a neoliberal economy long before the first lockdowns began. In the introduction to The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, Lyotard identifies a “logic of maximum performance” that regulates the contemporary moment: a cybernetic framework for understanding what it means to communicate—one that ultimately frames all political, social, and personal interactions within matrices of power laid out in terms of performativity and optimisation (xxiv.) Performativity serves as a foundation for not only how a system operates, but for how all other elements within that system express themselves. Lyotard writes, “even when its rules are in the process of changing and innovations are occurring, even when its dysfunctions (such as strikes, crises, unemployment, or political revolutions) inspire hope and lead to a belief in an alternative, even then what is actually taking place is only an internal readjustment, and its results can be no more than an increase in the system’s ‘viability’” (11-12). One may well add to this list of dysfunctions global pandemics. Zoom, in effect, offered universities, corporations, mass media outlets, and other organisations a platform to “innovate” within an ongoing network logic of performativity: to maintain business as usual in a moment in which nothing was usual, normal, or functional. Zoom foregrounds performativity in other senses as well, to the extent that it provides a space and context for social performance. In The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Erving Goffman explores how social actors move through their social environments, managing their identities in response to the space in which they find themselves and the audience (who are also social actors) within those spaces. For Goffman, the social environment provides the primary context for how and why social actors behave the way that they do. Goffman further denotes different spaces where our performances may shift: from public settings to smaller audiences, to private spaces where we can inhabit ourselves without any performance demands. The advent of social media, however, has added new layers to how we understand performance, audience, and public and private social spaces. Indeed, Goffman’s assertion that we are constantly managing our impressions feels particularly accurate when considering the added pressures of managing our identities in multiple social spaces, both face to face and online. Thus, when the world shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, and all forms of social interactions shifted to digital spaces, the performative demands of working from home became all the more complex in the sharp merging of private and public spaces. Thus, discussions and debates arose regarding proper “Zoom etiquette”, for different settings, and what constituted work-appropriate attire when working from home (a debate that, unsurprisingly, became particularly gendered in nature). Privacy management was a near constant narrative as we began asking, who can be in our spaces? How much of our homes are we required to put on display to other classmates, co-workers, and even our friends? In many ways, the hyper-dependence on Zoom interactions forced an entry into the spaces that we so often kept private, leaving our social performances permanently on display. Prior to COVID-19, the networks of everyday life had already produced rather porous boundaries between public and private life, but for the most part, individuals managed to maintain some sort of partition between domestic, intimate spaces, and their public performances of their professional and civic selves. It was an exception in The Before Times, for example, for a college professor to be interrupted in the midst of his BBC News interview by his children wandering into the room; the suspended possibility of the private erupting in the midst of a public social space (or vice versa) haunts all of our network interactions, yet the exceptionality of these moments speaks to the degree to which we sustained an illusion of two distinct stages for performance in a pre-pandemic era. Now, what was once the exception has become the rule. As millions of individuals found themselves Zooming from home while engaging co-workers, clients, patients, and students in professional interactions, the interpenetration of the public and private became a matter of daily fare. And yes, while early on in the pandemic several newsworthy (or at least meme-worthy) stories circulated widely on mass media and social media alike, serving as teleconferencing cautionary tales—usually involving sex, drugs, or bowel movements—moments of transgressive privacy very much became the norm: we found ourselves, in the midst of the workday, peering into backgrounds of bedrooms and kitchens, examining decorations and personal effects, and sharing in the comings and goings of pets and other family members entering and leaving the frame. Some users opted for background images or made use of blurring effects to “hide the mess” of their daily lives. Others, however, seemed to embrace the blur itself, implicitly or explicitly accepting the everydayness of this new liminality between public and private life. And while we acknowledge the transgressive nature of the incursions of the domestic and the intimate into workplace activities, it is worth noting as well that this incursion likewise takes place in the opposite direction, as spaces once designated as private became de facto workplace settings, and fell under the purview of a whole range of workplace policies that dictated appropriate and inappropriate behaviour. Not least of these intrusions are the literal and ideological apparatuses of surveillance that Zoom and other video conferencing platforms set into motion. In the original conception of the Panopticon, the observer could see the observed, but those being observed could not see their observers. This was meant to instill a sense of constant surveillance, whether the observer was there or not. In Discipline and Punish, Foucault considered those observed through the Panopticon as objects to be observed, with no power to turn the gaze back towards the structures of power that infiltrated their existence with such invasive intent. With Zoom, however, as much as private spaces have been infiltrated by work, school, and even family and friends, those leading classes or meetings may also feel a penetrative gaze by those who observe their professional performances, as many online participants have pushed back against these intrusions with cameras and audio turned off, leaving the performer with an audience of black screens and no indication of real observers behind them or not. In these unstable digital spaces, we vacillate between observed and observer, with the lines between private and public, visible and invisible, utterly blurred. Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that the panoptic power of the platform itself is hardly optic and remains one degree removed from its users, at the level of data extraction, collection, and exchange. In an already data-dependent era, more privacy and personal data has become available than ever before through online monitoring and the constant use of Zoom in work and social interactions. Such incursions of informatic biopower require further consideration within an emerging discussion of digital capital. There has also been the opportunity for these transformative, digital spaces to be used for an invited gaze into artistic and imaginative spaces. The global pandemic hit many industries hard, but in particular, artists and performers, as well as their performance venues, saw a massive loss of space, audiences, and income. Many artists developed performance spaces through online video conferencing in order to maintain their practice and their connection to their audiences, while others developed new curriculums and worked to find accessible ways for community members to participate in online art programming. Thus, though performers may still be faced with black squares as their audience, the invited gaze allows for artistic performances to continue, whether as digital shorts, live streamed music sets, or isolated cast members performing many roles with a reduced cast list. Though the issue of access to the technology and bandwidth needed to partake in these performances and programming is still front of mind, the presentation of artistic performances through Zoom has allowed in many other ways for a larger audience reach, from those who may not live near a performance centre, to others who may not be able to access physical spaces comfortably or safely. The ideology of ongoing productivity and expanded, remote access baked into video conferencing platforms like Zoom is perhaps most apparent in the assumptions of access that accompanied the widespread use of these platforms, particularly in the context of public institutions such as schools. In the United States, free market libertarian think tanks like the Cato Institute have pointed to the end of “Net Neutrality” as a boon for infrastructure investment that led to greater broadband access nationwide (compared to a more heavily regulated industry in Europe). Yet even policy think tanks such as the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation—with its mission to “formulate, evaluate, and promote policy solutions that accelerate innovation and boost productivity to spur growth, opportunity, and progress”—acknowledged that although the U.S. infrastructure supported the massive increase in bandwidth demands as schools and businesses went online, gaps in rural access and affordability barriers for low income users mean that more needs to be done to bring about “a more just and effective broadband network for all Americans”. But calls for greater access are, in effect, supporting this same ideological framework in which greater access presumably equates with greater equity. What the COVID-19 pandemic revealed, we would argue, is the degree to which those most in need of services and support experience the greatest degree of digital precarity, a point that Jenny Kennedy, Indigo Holcombe-James, and Kate Mannell foreground in their piece “Access Denied: How Barriers to Participate on Zoom Impact on Research Opportunity”. As they note, access to data and devices provide a basic threshold for participation, but the ability to deploy these tools and orient oneself toward these sorts of engagements suggests a level of fluency beyond what many high-risk/high-need populations may already possess. Access reveals a disposition toward global networks, and as such signals one’s degree of social capital within a network society—a “state nobility” for the digital age (Bourdieu.) While Zoom became the default platform for a wide range of official and institutional practices, from corporate meetings to college class sessions, we have seen over the past year unanticipated engagements with the platform as well. Zoombombing offers one form of evil media practice that disrupts the dominant performativity logic of Zoom and undermines the assumptions of rational exchange that still drive much of how we understand “effective” communication (Fuller and Goffey). While we may be tempted to dismiss Zoombombing and other forms of “shitposting” as “mere” trollish distractions, doing so does not address the political agency of strategic actions on these platforms that refuse to abide by “an intersubjective recognition that is based on a consensus about values or on mutual understanding” (Habermas 12). Kawsar Ali takes up these tactical uses in “Zoom-ing in on White Supremacy: Zoom-Bombing Anti-Racism Efforts” and explores how alt-right and white supremacist groups have exploited these strategies not only as a means of disruption but as a form of violence against participants. A cluster of articles in this issue take up the question of creative practice and how video conferencing technologies can be adapted to performative uses that were perhaps not intended or foreseen by the platform’s creators. xtine burrough and Sabrina Starnaman offer up one such project in “Epic Hand Washing: Synchronous Participation and Lost Narratives”, which paired live performances of handwashing in domestic spaces with readings from literary texts that commented upon earlier pandemics and plagues. While Zoom presents itself as a tool to keep a neoliberal economy flowing, we see modes of use such as burrough’s and Starnaman’s performative piece that are intentionally playful, at the same time that they attempt to address the lived experiences of lockdown, confinement, and hygienic hypervigilance. Claire Parnell, Andrea Anne Trinidad, and Jodi McAlister explore another form of playful performance through their examination of the #RomanceClass community in the Philippines, and how they adapted their biannual reading and performance events of their community-produced English-language romance fiction. While we may still use comparative terms such as “face-to-face” and “virtual” to distinguish between digitally-mediated and (relatively) unmediated interactions, Parnell et al.’s work highlights the degree to which these technologies of mediation were already a part of this community’s attempt to support and sustain itself. Zoom, then, became the vehicle to produce and share community-oriented kilig, a Filipino term for embodied, romantic affective response. Shaun Wilson’s “Creative Practice through Teleconferencing in the Era of COVID-19” provides another direct reflection on the contemporary moment and the framing aesthetics of Zoom. Through an examination of three works of art produced for screen during the COVID-19 pandemic, including his own project “Fading Light”, Wilson examines how video conferencing platforms create “oscillating” frames that speak to and comment on each other at the same time that they remain discrete and untouched. We have opened and closed this issue with bookends of sorts, bringing to the fore a range of theoretical considerations alongside personal reflections. In our feature article, “Room without Room: Affect and Abjection in the Circuit of Self-Regard”, Ricky Crano examines the degree to which the aesthetics of Zoom, from its glitches to its default self-view, create modes of interaction that drain affect from discourse, leaving its users with an impoverished sense of co-presence. His focus is explicitly on the normative uses of the platform, not the many artistic and experimental misappropriations that the platform likewise offers. He concludes, “it is left to artists and other experimenters to expose and undermine the workings of power in the standard corporate, neoliberal modes of engagement”, which several of the following essays in this issue then take up. And we close with “Embracing Liminality and ‘Staying with the Trouble’ on (and off) Screen”, in which Tania Lewis, Annette Markham, and Indigo Holcombe-James explore two autoethnographic studies, Massive and Microscopic Sensemaking and The Shut-In Worker, to discuss the liminality of our experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, on and off—and in between—Zoom screens. Rather than suggesting a “return to normal” as mask mandates, social distancing, and lockdown restrictions ease, they attempt to “challenge the assumption that stability and certainty is what we now need as a global community … . How can we use the discomfort of liminality to imagine global futures that have radically transformative possibilities?” This final piece in the collection we take to heart, as we consider how we, too, can stay in the trouble, and consider transformative futures. Each of these pieces offers a thoughtful contribution to a burgeoning discussion on what Zooming means to us as academics, teachers, researchers, and community members. Though investigations into the social effects of digital spaces are not new, this moment in time requires careful and critical investigation through the lens of a global pandemic as it intersects with a world that has never been more digital in its presence and social interactions. The articles in this volume bring us to a starting point, but there is much more to cover: issues of disability and accessibility, gender and physical representations, the political economy of digital accessibility, the transformation of learning styles and experiences through a year of online learning, and still more areas of investigation to come. It is our hope that this volume provides a blueprint of sorts for other critical engagements and explorations of how our lives and our digital landscapes have been impacted by COVID-19, regardless of the instability of our connections. We would like to thank all of the contributors and peer reviewers who made this fascinating issue possible, with a special thanks to the Cultural Studies Association New Media and Digital Cultures Working Group, where these conversations started … on Zoom, of course.

Mental health care in Karnataka,2021,"Karnataka state has taken many strides forward with regard to the District Mental Health Program (DMHP) and is one of the few states to have dedicated DMHP psychiatrists as team leaders in all the districts. Moreover, some of the recent developments have moved beyond the Bellary model and augur well for the nation. This article attempts to provide a summary of such developments in the state and discusses the future directions. CORE SERVICES DMHP in Karnataka offers (a) clinical services, including the outreach services (on a rotation basis), covering the primary health centers (PHCs), community health centers, and taluk hospitals; (b) training of all the medical officers and other health professionals such as nurses and pharmacists of the district; (c) information, education, and communication (IEC) activities – posters, wall paintings in PHCs, IEC activities for schools, colleges, police personnel, judicial departments, elected representatives, faith healers, bus branding, radio talks, etc., In addition, sensitization of Anganwadi workers, accredited social health activists, auxiliary nurse midwives, police/prison staff, agriculture department/horticulture department/primary land development bank staff, village rehabilitation workers, staff of noncommunicable disease/revised National Tuberculosis Control Program, etc.; and (d) targeted interventions are being focused on life skills education and counseling in schools, college counseling services, workplace stress management, and suicide prevention services. These initiatives have led to a phenomenal increase in patient footfalls to clinics [Figure 1] and >100,000 stakeholders are trained in various aspects of mental health (in the past 3 years).Figure 1: Chart showing the phenomenal increase in the number of footfalls covered over the past 3 yearsSEAMLESS MEDICATION AVAILABILITY The procurement has been streamlined. The state-level purchase is done by the Karnataka Drugs and Logistics Society, based on the indents collated from each of the districts, and then, sent to their respective district warehouses. Individual indenters (taluk hospitals, community health centers, and primary health centers) then need to procure them from the district warehouses. The amount spent for the purpose has gone up drastically to INR 3 crores (30 million rupees) in the past financial year (2017–2018). However, further streamlining is possible in the sense that the delays can be further curtailed. THE COLLABORATION WITH THE KARNATAKA STATE WAKF BOARD The WAKF board of Karnataka runs a ""Darga"" in south interior Karnataka. Thousands of persons with mental illnesses do come over here for religious cure. On a day of every week, the attendance crosses 10,000 footfalls. Recently, the authorities have agreed to come up with an allopathic PHC inside the campus of the Darga. The idea is to have integrated and comprehensive care for patients without hurting their religious sentiments. Although such collaborative initiatives are spread across the country, this one is occurring at a larger scale with involvement of governmental agencies [Table 1].Table 1: Details of the key developments and innovations in mental health care in IndiaRESEARCH INITIATIVES Although excellent evidence-based studies have come out in community settings, actual involvement of government machinery in these kinds of initiatives is few and far. Their involvement is imperative for the evidence to become pragmatic and generalizable. Of course, by doing so, the methodological rigor compromises a bit. NIMHANS and Government of Karnataka have been collaborating for such service-driven research initiatives for over a decade and a half. Community-based interventions are going on in three taluks – Thirthahalli, Turuvekere, and Jagaluru, wherein cohorts of severe mental disorders are being cared for. In addition, several research questions (of public health significance) are being answered.[67] Exciting new initiatives are also underway: examining the magnitude of reduction of treatment gap by these community interventions, impact of care at doorsteps (CAD) services from the DMHP machinery, impact of technology-based mentoring program for DMHP staff, evaluation of the impact of tele-OCT, etc. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS All the above-mentioned activities in Karnataka take it beyond the Bellary model of DMHP. For example, the Memorandum of understanding (MOU) between NIMHANS and the state gives the flexibility and easy maneuverability for active collaboration. Odisha is another state which has taken this path of MOU. This collaborative activity can be expanded pan India as there are several Centers of Excellence spread throughout India. Another aspect of the Karnataka story is collaborative research activity. As described above, many activities going on across the state have the potential to inform public health policies. Karnataka has also been able to counter long-standing and well-known criticisms of DMHP/NMHP: for example, issues related to human resources, availability of medications, funding, mentoring and monitoring, and sustenance, etc., at least to an extent. Of course, the state needs to do much more for mental health care. For example, compliance with Mental Health Care Act-2017; handling unequal distribution of mental health human resources; rigorous involvement of local administration to tackle micro-level issues; refining DMHP to suit special populations such as geriatric, children, and adolescents; and perinatal and upscaling urban DMHP, in areas such as Bengaluru Metropolitan City. Another area for improvement is that the DMHP evaluation strategies should move beyond head counting and consider meaningful patient-related outcomes, including cost-effective analysis. Digital technology should further be exploited. The upcoming Karnataka Mental Healthcare Management System is a step in the right direction.[8] Finally, the DMHP should involve health and wellness centers to cater to the mental health needs, particularly for follow-up services, case detection, providing basic counseling, stress management, advocating lifestyle changes, relapse prevention strategies, and other preventive and promotive strategies.","['mental', 'health', 'care', 'karnataka']"
“Feared and Avoided”,2021,"Background The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been wreaking havoc all over the world in recent times. In the wake of high rates of transmissibility and infection rates, vaccines still in development, evolving information on treatment strategies, widespread deficiency of drugs and hospital equipment, and being physically restricted and monitored, the health-care professionals have been at the receiving end of both the physiological effects of the outbreak and its consequences. The fear of an unknown illness has led to the health care workers (HCWs) being discriminated and defamed in various parts of the world.[1] The transmission rate of COVID-19 is much more than its earlier congeners like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, leading to a rapid spread of the infection throughout the globe.[2] Understandably, all the frontline workers are at increased risk of infection. In addition, the HCWs (physicians, nurses, and paramedical staff), especially those working directly with the COVID-19 patients, are much more vulnerable. Besides devastating lives and livelihood globally, the risk to the HCWs has always been on the forefront. Data from the Amnesty International showed that over 3000 HCWs had died from COVID-19 from 63 countries, including India, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) being one of the major reasons. The extrapolated data are obviously the ""tip of the iceberg,"" as sporadically numerous pandemic-related deaths have been reported all over within the HCW community. The Indian Medical Association announced the demise of 196 doctors in the line of COVID-19 duty as of August 9 and has appealed to the central government for help, support, life insurance facilities, and better protection in the line of their work.[3] The fear of infection and mortality, occupational hazards of contamination, guilt, and concern of transmitting to the family members and stigma surrounding the same affect them regularly. All these factors combined with professional issues such as chronic stress, trauma, and burnout can lead to an array of mental health problems in the HCWs. Stigma, discrimination, and prejudice against them can only amplify and complicate these psychosocial issues. This can affect their professional quality of life (QOL), increase the job-related demands, worsen sleep quality, impair interpersonal relationships, and reduce self-esteem, all of which can worsen coping during the ongoing crisis.[4] A multipronged approach involving intervention such as counseling, psychotherapy, support, training, and providing up-to-date information is suggested to combat these issues in a timely manner so that the mental health of these frontline warriors be protected during these dangerous times.[4] Keeping this in background, this article glances at the problem statement of stigma against the HCWs and ways of mitigating the same. Global Problem Situation Pandemics have been an integral part of human existence, from the Black Plague, small pox, Ebola, and the Spanish flu of 1918 that have killed millions over the centuries. The world has been reeling under the grasp of yet another unique virus infection, namely COVID-19 which has led to major public health challenges. It has been said that the spread started from Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and in a span of few months has spread to all countries. Although 70%–80% of the population may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic respiratory disease, 20%–30% of the people suffer from severe and life-threatening complications and death.[2] Globally, the case number has crossed the 45 million mark as per the current World Health Organization (WHO) estimate, with most countries in the community transmission stage of the pandemic with a case fatality rate varying from <0.1% to over 25% across nations.[56] In a bid to control the caseload, countries all over the world have implemented lockdowns and quarantine measures. The emergence of this outbreak has led to socioeconomic crises, unemployment, migrant crisis, glaring deficits in health care, and mental health challenges on a global scale.[7] What started with an unidentified pneumonia has eventually turned into an intriguing illness plaguing the world with rising cases and fatalities each day. Psychosocial Effects on the Health-Care Workers HCWs have been on the frontline of the current COVID-19 pandemic that has been sweeping across the world. From long duty hours, unavailability of PPEs and drugs, increasing caseload, perceived lack of support from the administration, absence of proper information channels, government apathy, and nascent policies and regulations, the HCWs have been going through complex and complicated times.[348] Multiple factors such as stress in the workplace, feelings of helplessness due to the rising mortality rate, worry and guilt about exposing their families and loved ones to possible risk of infection and the social stigma of possibly being a viral carrier has adversely affected the mental health and self efficacy of the HCWs. Common mental health and psychosocial challenges that the HCWs face on daily basis are:[8] Anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms Poor coping strategies Issues of being in isolation and quarantine Physical and mental fatigue Stress and loneliness Risk of moral injury Public stigma, discrimination, and self-stigma Worry and responsibilities about loved ones Possible guilt for spreading infection Uncertainties in workplace and future. In a review of the mental health problems faced by the HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic, Spoorthy et al.[8] highlighted the role of stigma, place, and department of work which were correlated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and insomnia. Further, these psychological problems were also related to poor social support, social exclusion, decreased self-efficacy, and reduced help-seeking for the HCWs. The need to prioritize mental health care for the HCWs using a multidisciplinary approach was suggested by the authors. The ""Health-Stigma-Discrimination model"" for the vulnerable minorities can be applied to this frontline population as well where increased risk of exposure to the infection in the line of work and societal attributional biases form the drivers of stigma, which further facilitate and perpetuate self-stigma.[9] This can lead to internal misrepresentations of the ""perceived discrimination"" that can worsen the psychological status, prevent social inclusion, impair work efficiency and QOL, as well as reduce help-seeking behavior in the HCWs. Studies done in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the epidemic, showed that HCWs experienced anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms with a lack of social support that can probably lead to devastating effects in sleep quality and self-efficacy.[1011] Those working in high-risk settings and interact with critical patients also displayed posttraumatic stress symptoms.[12] Levels of distress have also been noted to be positively correlated with lack of control over events and proper up-to-date information.[13] This can in turn can also lead to a vicious cycle of guilt and self-stigma. Stigma against Health-Care Workers ""Stigma"" is defined as the process of negatively correlating the attributes of certain individuals which are then devalued and discredited.[14] This negative association has led to discrimination based on race, religion, region, gender, and sexual orientation as well as illnesses. This inherent nature of a human to fear an unknown affliction or an abnormality has evolved over time to protect them from life-threatening diseases and has programmed them to stay away as a part of natural selection.[15] These psychological adaptations of self-protection have morphed into negative emotions and cognitions which translate to avoidance, stereotyping, and other discriminatory behaviors.[16] As Zhong Nanshan, president of the Chinese Medical Association, once said during the 2003 SARS outbreak, ""The psychological fear (of a disease) is more fearful than the disease itself.""[17] The close proximity of working with infected individuals has led to significant stigmatization of the HCWs among the society. Accused of being the ""carriers of contagion,"" many have been turned out of their apartments and verbally as well as physically abused.[1819] The fear of marginalization due to the potential contraction of the virus also has led to riots and physical harm to the health professionals in specific pockets of regions leading to difficulties in sample collection and contact tracing. Hence, it is only natural for these fears to dictate the beliefs and attitudes of the health professionals as well. It is this anxiety that has perhaps led to patients to be turned away from hospitals and clinics, ambulances refusing to ferry patients, providing less accurate care. This is similar to the 1994 Surat plague outbreak when 80% of the private physicians left the city forsaking their Hippocratic oath.[20] Related incidents were noted during the SARS outbreak when growing resentment among the staff on having to work on being chosen for the job in isolation wards/intensive care units led to refusal to work shifts.[21] A recent study by Ramaci et al.4 shows that stigma has a positive correlation to fatigue and negative outcomes such as burnout, and inversely impacts work satisfaction among HCWs. Being ostracized in one's line of work can have consequences such insomnia, lack of concentration, lethargy, and depression which causes a fall in the standard of care. Mental Health concerns arising out of being sidelined and isolated in the society can also lead to further self-stigma since many HCWs would rather not acknowledge professional psychological or psychiatric help. This can in turn lead to a higher risk of suicidality and stress.[22] Since stigmatized attitudes can have adverse effects on professional and personal QOL and emotional well-being, it becomes crucial to prioritize the same. Dispelling stigma through adequate training, provision of adequate protective gear, and dispelling misinformation have proven effective through multilevel activities while working with patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and Ebola.[23] A recent systematic review by Banerjee et al.[24] related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychosocial health and mental well-being in the South Asian countries reported the poorer quality of sleep, chronic stress, perceived stigma, and increased psychological distress in the frontline HCWs of these countries. In the same article, the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) also advocates the need for multidisciplinary strategies at all levels (individual, society, and administrative) to improve the QOL of the frontline workers and fight the discrimination toward them. The IPS recognizes the unique plight of the frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 and has called for mental health promotion among them together with community participation in mitigating both the societal and self-stigma. Liaison with the media and the government will be vital to spread this message among all classes of society. Large-scale pandemics frequently give rise to xenophobic sentiments and a recent Indian study has shown this xenophobia to increase the ""fear of coronavirus"" during the pandemic that can be mitigated through collectivism and positivism.[25] Further, the rise of misinformation and disinformation during COVID-19 has transformed it into a ""digital infodemic"" that along with increased use of social media can lead to faulty interpretations of ""facts"" related to the spread, pathogenesis, and duration of infection. The cognitive biases and emotional overtones associated with the psychology of misinformation can further increase fear, rumor mongering, stigma, and avoidance of the frontline COVID-19 workers, including the HCWs.[26] The Way Forward: Strategies for Mitigation of Distress There is a need for multidisciplinary intervention in the face of ongoing stigma and other work demands so that the much-needed mental health needs among HCWs be met. There is thus an immense need to add mental health support networks in the hospitals itself so that the HCWs do not feel alone and feel confidant of seeking help.[27] Studies during the SARS outbreak showed that formal and informal psychological support to staff telephonically and electronically, especially to those in quarantine, has shown immense benefit in reducing the worry among HCWs.[28] Involving the staff in group interviews to help deal with the potential risks and stressors in workplace may help to reduce the fear among them.[21] Training sessions involving information as to how to protect themselves in the workplace. ensuring ample time and space to rest, engaging in leisure activities in between shifts, peer support and self-resilience will help HCWs mentally and physically prepare themselves for facing these challenging times.[2930] At the same time, clear and up-to-date communication is necessary from the side of authorities so that the fear of uncertainty is dispelled.[31] Other key elements crucial to protecting the mental health of HCWs include acknowledging the difficult work being done by the HCWs and thereby building resilience, evaluating absenteeism, and assessing for any distress, constant monitoring of those in high-risk environments, and discussion with the team about emotional and personal perspectives on patients such as the Schwartz rounds model.[32] Furthermore, programs such as ""Time to Change"" have been devised to actively tackle mental health problems in the workplace and the stigma through support and self-help activities.[33] The Psychological First Aid model proposed by McCabe et al.[34] describes various steps to alleviate these feelings of distress and fear which can in turn lead to feeling isolated and discriminated. The salient aspects of this consensus-derived, empirically supported, and evidence-based model involve: To provide an outlet for emotional expression so as to ensure emotional well-being and stability To be connected to these individuals through friends, family, and religious groups, etc To provide information about stress and coping strategies useful for reducing distress and increasing the QOL so that enduring consequences such as posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression be prevented. Wong et al. had found that the most effective coping strategies that helped HCWs were those such as positive reframing, planning, and problem–solving, whereas methods of coping include venting, behavioral disengagement, and self-distraction as these defocused from the actual problem and its possible solutions.[1335] To alleviate distress through providing guidance, distraction techniques, relaxation methods, and also through cognitive restructuring and psychotherapy. All these strategies will benefit in mitigating the aftereffects of feeling discriminated against as well as feeling of self-blame, guilt, and self-stigma. The media plays an important role to improve the knowledge–attitude–practice gap of the general public through information–education–communication activities using public figures. This helps reducing stigma and discrimination toward the frontline workers. By acknowledging and publicizing the work of frontline health workers in a positive light, terming the HCWs as ""heroes"" of the pandemic not only builds their morale but also motivates the community to respect their efforts more leading to more acceptability in the community. The frequent comparison with the frontline army during a war might be a good analogy to start with; however, the ""war against COVID-19"" is long lasting and far from over. Despite the understanding of the service provided by the HCWs during these difficult times, nationwide discrimination and violence toward HCWs continued to exist which prompted the Government of India released an ordinance in April 2020 to the Epidemic Disease Act (1897) that makes any act of violence against a health personnel cognizable and nonbailable with imprisonment and fine.[36A] global system of surveillance is also required and the data added to the WHO Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare can measure to prevent such attacks be planned and implemented.[37] Naming the HCWs as ""Corona warriors"" and merely patronizing them might help in publicizing their efforts but does little in improving public awareness about their efforts and challenges. Conclusion With a lack of proven treatments, vaccinations still in development and a general deficiency in preparedness for such a large-scale pandemic in most nations; it is only understandable that the most feared will be the most avoided. The stress of working in an environment caring for an insidious illness and filled with uncertainties has to be recognized and the burden of stigma be mitigated among the HCWs for a better QOL. This requires the concerted effort of the authorities at all levels and creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams so that timely interventions can be planned for the benefit of the frontline mental health-care professionals. Preparedness for pandemics is important, both resource-wise and at psychological levels. Legislations to improve policies related to the care of HCWs and modify public perceptions about them can help to shape ways for such futuristic crises. As discussed, they are at risk both to the physiological effects of the virus as well as the psychosocial consequences. Arguably, the holistic care of the workforce who fights the virus is important for the public health as well. The pandemic is still widening its clutches. Systematic research into the mental health issues and stigma faced by the HCWs will help to shape interventions, especially their lived experiences during the ongoing struggle. When the world faces a global crisis, collectivism and optimism help to navigate the course. It is a collective responsibility at all levels of stakeholders to support, understand, empathize, and care for the HCWs not only during the fight against the ongoing viral outbreak but also the postpandemic aftermath.","['“feared', 'avoided”']"
Investigating the Feasibility of Using a Wearable Device to Measure Physiologic Health Data in Emergency Nurses and Residents: Observational Cohort Study,2024,"Background Emergency departments play a pivotal role in the US health care system, with high use rates and inherent stress placed on patients, patient care, and clinicians. The impact of the emergency department environment on the health and well-being of emergency residents and nurses can be seen in worsening rates of burnout and cardiovascular health. Research on clinician health has historically been completed outside of clinical areas and not personalized to the individual. The expansion of digital technology, specifically wearable devices, may enhance the ability to understand how health care environments impact clinicians. Objective The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using wearable devices to measure and record physiologic data from emergency nurses and resident physicians. Understanding strategies that are accepted and used by clinicians is critical prior to launching larger investigations aimed at improving outcomes. Methods This was a longitudinal pilot study conducted at an academic, urban, level 1 trauma center. A total of 20 participants, including emergency medicine resident physicians and nurses, were equipped with a wearable device (WHOOP band) and access to a mobile health platform for 6 weeks. Baseline surveys assessed burnout, mental health, and expectations of the device and experience. Participants provided open-ended feedback on the device and platform, contributing to the assessment of acceptance, adoption, and use of the wearable device. Secondary measures explored early signs and variations in heart rate variability, sleep, recovery, burnout, and mental health assessments. Results Of the 20 participants, 10 consistently used the wearable device. Feedback highlighted varying experiences with the device, with a preference for more common wearables like the Apple Watch or Fitbit. Resident physicians demonstrated higher engagement with the device and platform as compared with nurses. Baseline mental health assessments indicated mild anxiety and depressive symptoms among participants. The Professional Fulfillment Index revealed low professional fulfillment, moderate workplace exhaustion, and interpersonal disengagement. Conclusions This pilot study underscores the potential of wearable devices in monitoring emergency clinicians’ physiologic data but reveals challenges related to device preferences and engagement. The key takeaway is the necessity to optimize device and platform design for clinician use. Larger, randomized trials are recommended to further explore and refine strategies for leveraging wearable technology to support the well-being of the emergency workforce.","['investigating', 'feasibility', 'wearable', 'device', 'measure', 'physiologic', 'health', 'data', 'emergency', 'nurses', 'residents:', 'observational', 'cohort', 'study']"
An arrow pointing somewhere,2020,"The Helsinki Declaration on Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology (hereafter ‘the Declaration’) was launched in 2010 by the European Board of Anaesthesiologists and the European Union of Medical Specialists in close co-operation with the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA).1 The ESA initiated a project designed to assess and improve the adoption of the Declaration's requirements, as there were few data about its uptake.2 The first phase, an online survey of ESA members, was recently published.3 The second phase of this investigation, reported here, aimed to ask national leaders in anaesthesiology in a number of European countries about patient safety and the role played by the Declaration, and its benefits, limitations and barriers in daily practice. We used a semistructured interview guide with open-ended questions. The interview transcripts were analysed by standard qualitative methods,4,5 through a broadly ethnographic approach, drawing on the theoretical framework known as ‘Safety II’, which aims to understand why things go right in healthcare safety most of the time, complementing the ‘Safety I’ approach which seeks to learn from error.6,7 Between August 2018 and May 2019, we conducted seventeen interviews with senior national leaders in European anaesthesiology, lasting a median [range] of 56 [34 to 100] min. Respondents mentioned a number of activities, structures and processes that they believed exert a positive influence on patient safety. These commonly included: education; guidelines and protocols (whether at European, national or departmental level); monitoring; pre-operative assessment; and training (especially around the use of new technology).8 The risk from medication errors was also frequently discussed. Table 1 summarises respondents’ perceptions of the influence on safety in European anaesthesiology. We categorised interviewees’ responses into six main themes, presented below. Further methodological detail, data analysis with illustrative quotations, and discussion can be found on the journal's website (Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/EJA/A246).Table 1: Summary of respondents’ perceptions of influences on patient safety in European anaesthesiology‘Like a juggler, with a lot of balls in the air’: clinical changes in anaesthesiology since 2010 There were three commonly cited areas of change: intensifying workload; more challenging patients; and suboptimal pre-operative preparation. Within this there was common agreement that day case surgery has become more widespread; however, this brings pressure to administer anaesthesia to older and multiply comorbid patients without the desired pre-operative investigations. A sense of frustration and stress was apparent as a result. In addition, high workload intensity has led to a perceived erosion of professional identity and patient safety. Similarly, there was an explicit appreciation, too, of the role of the anaesthesiologist in maintaining vigilance for the rest of the healthcare team, almost like a ‘goalkeeper’. Workload pressure extends into the intra-operative period, with senior anaesthesiologists being less able to provide adequate supervision. The fact that safety problems seem to be uncommon (and may not be fully captured by quantitative audits or official governance systems) does not make compromises in safety standards acceptable. Respondents mentioned the temptation to ‘cut corners’ to get the work done. ‘Fighting not to fall down’: external influences on patient safety Respondents focused predominantly on resource constraints, as well as relationships between hospitals, governmental bodies and national anaesthesiology societies. Although some mentioned the perceived benefits of improved pan-European professional relationships, there were a number of challenges such as anaesthesiology workforce migration, hospital finances, salaries, working conditions and staffing. We discerned within the responses two discrete types of relationship between hospital anaesthesiology departments and the broader healthcare system. In some countries it was clear that departments and their parent hospitals work within a national policy framework, within standards set by national anaesthesiology societies and national governmental bodies, informed by the results of large-scale, organised safety and quality data reporting. In other countries, Ministries of Health and national societies are regarded as out of touch or ineffectual, with clinical practice working on a more ‘decentralised’ model. Within this, the departmental ‘chief’ was repeatedly cited as the source of departmental policy and the reference point for reporting of problems or arbitration. ‘An arrow pointing somewhere’: what the Helsinki Declaration means in practice The Declaration is perceived as a force for good, a standardisation framework and a catalyst for change. It benefits from being succinctly laid out, yet broad in scope. This has led to its acceptance and utilisation, though implementation requires tailoring from country to country. The general themes of the Declaration were better known than more specific details. Respondents from a number of countries, typically from northern Europe, commented that their national safety standards and discourse are already more advanced than the contents of the Declaration might advocate. However, Europe is a diverse continent and the Declaration's standards have been useful elsewhere in enabling change and improvement. The Declaration also seems to link into anaesthesiology education. Despite knowledge of the Declaration itself being variable, the themes and overall aims of the Declaration were commonly reported to be present within anaesthesiology training curricula, albeit without referring to the document explicitly. ‘Attitude education’: culture, training and human factors The vast majority of respondents highlighted the critical nature of safety culture, human factors and training systems in maintaining patient safety. Culture plays a key role in the adoption of safety tools and practices. For instance, the uptake of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is dictated by the context in which it is introduced. A respondent from one country suggested that their compatriots were unlikely to accept attempts to shape their behaviour, commenting that people in that country have a cultural tendency to resist following rules. Similarly, a workplace where staff feel familiar with each other does not necessarily create a perceived need to undertake introductions and talk through proposed operations. Several countries were in the process of publishing a new training curriculum, or else had recently done so, with an agreement that simulation, patient safety and human factors were a much more prominent feature; ‘attitudes’ to safety being as important as technical prowess. ‘A good anaesthesiologist can explain his work well’: the patient perspective in anaesthesiology Common themes included public understanding of anaesthesia, patient feedback and trust in healthcare systems. Respondents in many countries suggested that patients typically focus on risks posed by surgery itself, rather than the wider peri-operative period or specifically anaesthesia. The role of the anaesthesiologist is often underappreciated, as is the influence of patient comorbidities on peri-operative safety. Nevertheless, empowerment and education were seen as vital, with the pre-operative clinic and broader public health campaigns providing part of a solution. The role of patients’ views and observations was also highlighted, though many hospitals and countries lack a co-ordinated means of harnessing such safety ‘intelligence’. Attitudes and practices towards disclosure of problems and patient involvement vary, with some respondents describing a situation of public mistrust in medical professionals with a reciprocal medicolegal ‘paranoia’ from clinicians. ‘We tried it, it didn’t work. Nobody said anything’: critical incident reporting There is a lack of uniformity in incident reporting compliance and system availability. Standardised reporting systems were often found for specific incidents such as difficult airways, allergic reactions and drug events. However, national level data co-ordination, analysis and reporting are challenging or nonexistent in some countries. In keeping with the previously described ‘decentralised’ healthcare systems, many respondents felt that incident reports went no further than departmental ‘chiefs’, and did not feel any further sharing took place. Indeed, these individuals were often frustrated that mandatory incident reporting did not lead to any regional or national reporting, thus they are unable to ascertain common themes, trends or potential solutions. Incidents may not be reported to the patient, department or higher-level systems. Factors influencing this include perceived severity, patient outcome, time pressures and attitudes towards the reporting system. Discussion To be effective in practice, quality and safety improvement tools and initiatives must take account of the complexities of healthcare practice and ‘make sense’ to practitioners within the context of their practice. This argues for a sociologically based approach which constructs an account of patient safety in anaesthesiology reflecting participants’ perceptions of, and meanings attributed to, patient safety within the social context of anaesthesiology practice.9 Practitioners’ own views of the work they do is often somewhat different from how it is envisaged by policymakers and politicians (referred to, respectively, as ‘work as done’ and ‘work as imagined’ in recent safety scientific literature).6,7 They also need to resonate with the professional identity of the clinicians concerned.10 In addition to the previously noted roles which anaesthesiologists play,11 we see references to other, hitherto unrecognised roles. These include: ‘goalkeeper’ (acting as the ‘last stop’ to prevent potential hazards from becoming real); ‘firefighter’ (purely responding to events rather than feeling able to influence safety pro-actively); and ‘individualist’ (acting according to personal preferences rather than formal protocol). Finally, this approach argues for an expanded view of ‘human factors’, one which moves beyond psychology and engineering to encompass how people relate to each other.7,12 Two particular themes deserve further comment. Pre-operative assessment, for instance, of the patient's airway,13 and optimisation through modification of intercurrent disease14 and lifestyle factors, is widely regarded as essential to high-quality anaesthesia care. The suggestion that resource constraints are preventing this is concerning. Moreover, critical incident reporting structures and practice vary widely and, while systems must be properly resourced, social cultural factors amongst anaesthesiologists seem to play a significant role in determining whether anaesthesiologists actually make use of the systems that exist.15 The Helsinki Declaration would benefit from revitalisation, possibly by inviting signatories to confirm their continuing commitment on the Declaration's 10-year anniversary in 2020, and a publicity campaign. A revision would also afford an opportunity to tailor this valued, succinct document such that it reflects the changes in anaesthesiology since 2010 and the current concerns of practicing anaesthesiologists, patients and policymakers. Our suggestions for this, based on our findings, are set out in Table 2. Key issues for future consideration and research are those of anaesthesiology resilience and fatigue, an increase in workload and the delivery of safe care throughout the whole peri-operative period, increasingly on a day case basis, to an ageing and multiply comorbid population. Ultimately, these measures require investment from, and collaboration with, political stakeholders as well as anaesthesiologists.Table 2: Suggestions for further implementation and development of the Helsinki Declaration on Patient Safety in AnaesthesiologyAcknowledgements relating to this article Assistance with the Editorial: we wish to thank the members of the ESA Patient Safety and Quality Committee for their advice in designing and piloting the survey.

Health tracking technologies constitute behavioral interventions, and any behavioral intervention can precipitate positive or negative health outcomes. Although few would deny that this applies to wearables, there is a lack of empirical data about the prevalence of negative health outcomes or the individual traits that confer heightened risk for negative effects. Case studies suggest that wearable-induced health anxiety warrants empirical investigation. In one case report, a patient with atrial fibrillation and no psychiatric history developed health anxiety after acquiring a smartwatch, resulting in 12 emergency department visits despite repeated outpatient reassurance.5Rosman L.

Further research is needed to identify prevalence rates and for whom this is a significant risk. The exacerbation of existing mental disorders and the recurrence of disorders in remission also warrant rigorous investigation. Preliminary research has suggested that wearable technologies may have exacerbating effects on eating disorders; for example, a randomized-controlled trial that included wearable technology as part of behavioral treatment among individuals diagnosed with an eating disorder found that a subsample of participants reported that the wearable negatively affected disordered eating behaviors.7Wons O. Lampe E. Patarinski A.G. Schaumberg K. Butryn M. Juarascio A. Perceived influence of wearable fitness trackers on eating disorder symptoms in a clinical transdiagnostic binge eating and restrictive eating sample.Eat Weight Disord. 2022; 27: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar It is unknown whether recent developments in wearables, such as algorithms that provide nutrition recommendations, would mitigate these undesired effects. The field lacks empirical investigations into the impact of wearables on other mental disorders, but some expert commentaries11Piwek L. Ellis D.A. Andrews S. Joinson A. The rise of consumer health wearables: promises and barriers.PLoS Med. 2016; 13e1001953Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar,12Xue Y. A review on intelligent wearables: uses and risks.Hum Behav Emerg Technol. 2019; 1: 287-294Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar have remarked that classes of disorders most likely to be affected by wearable usage include depressive, sleep, and anxiety disorders. The data that wearables track may act directly on symptoms of these disorders (eg, rumination about sleep quality, reinforcement of negative beliefs about oneself). Wearables may also affect transdiagnostic processes that cut across psychiatric disorders, conferring increased risk for new or exacerbated psychological symptoms for some. For example, interoceptive awareness (the ability to identify, understand, and adaptively respond to one's bodily sensations) and its potential counterpart, interoceptive avoidance (the avoidance of certain body sensations and activities that produce them), are transdiagnostic processes implicated in several Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnoses. Continuous quantitative data about interoceptively detectable processes (eg, heart rate) seems likely to alter users' interoceptive awareness, but the field currently lacks data about how. Data from wearables are used by individuals to guide choices that directly affect health; thus, the same data that can inspire new, adaptive health behaviors can also lead to maladaptive health behaviors. Expert opinion articles have noted that inaccurate or incomplete data from wearables can lead to behaviors that harm health,1Bayoumy K. Gaber M.

A review on intelligent wearables: uses and risks.Hum Behav Emerg Technol. 2019; 1: 287-294Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar a concern that is exacerbated by exaggerated marketing claims that have sometimes been identified in validation studies of popular devices.18Sperlich B. Holmberg H.C. Wearable, yes, but able…?: it is time for evidence-based marketing claims!.B J Sports Med. 2017; 51: 1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar Consider an individual with a diagnosed heart condition who checks their smartwatch's cardiac data during an exercise session because they are experiencing unusual shortness of breath. If the wearable inaccurately characterizes normal heart rate and rhythm (whether because of measurement error or because the smartwatch is unable to detect an arrhythmia) and the user is not aware of the device's limitations, this inaccurate reassurance could cause a medical emergency. Others have raised the possibility of maladaptive health behaviors that can result from using wearables in medically healthy individuals, such as overexercising and disordered eating,8Blackstone S.R. Herrmann L.K. Fitness wearables and exercise dependence in college women: considerations for university health education specialists.Am J Health Edu. 2020; 51: 225-233Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar or maladaptive changes to health care utilization.5Rosman L.

However, research has yet to empirically characterize risk and protective factors. Such data are critically needed to inform user or patient education strategies that can mitigate these concerns and prevent adverse physical health outcomes (eg, injuries, worsened cardiovascular health, or mismanagement of a known condition) for groups of individuals at risk. For example, wearables designed for clinical research (and not consumer use) frequently restrict the data viewable by the wearer. It is possible that this approach may optimize health outcomes from consumer devices for some groups of individuals, although research is needed to identify best practices in this regard. The level of trust that people place in a wearable is closely linked to how they use and respond to the technology. Technological trust—or lack thereof—is associated with perceptions of the accuracy and usefulness of the device,19Rupp M.A. Michaelis J.R. McConnell D.S. Smither J.A. The role of individual differences on perceptions of wearable fitness device trust, usability, and motivational impact.Appl Ergo. 2018; 70: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and its perceived compatibility with the users' beliefs and values. Conflict with an individuals' values is highlighted as a challenge across digital health,20Lyles C.R. Nguyen O.K. Khoong E.C. Aguilera A. Sarkar U. Multilevel determinants of digital health equity: a literature synthesis to advance the field.Annu Rev Public Health. 2023; 44: 383-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar and wearables present a distinct set of concerns in this regard. Incorporating continuous biomarker monitoring into one's life is, ultimately, tied to beliefs about human-technology interactions. Although cultural variables have sometimes been included in nonrandomized usability and acceptability research,21Perski O. Short C.E. Acceptability of digital health interventions: embracing the complexity.Transl Behav Med. 2021; 11: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar they are largely absent from published efficacy trials. Investigations of technology-relevant beliefs and the role that these play in technological trust and clinical outcomes are important to include in future trials. A vitally important discussion about equity in digital health has emerged in recent years. This discussion recognizes that technological innovations are implemented within societal contexts; therefore, the systems of power, structural inequities, and disparities in healthcare that are part and parcel of societal systems strongly influence the outcomes of novel technologies. Although we direct readers to comprehensive analyses of digital health equity,20Lyles C.R. Nguyen O.K. Khoong E.C. Aguilera A. Sarkar U.

Individual-level vulnerabilities may either be exacerbated or buffered against by systemic contexts. Emergent evidence of racial differences in measurement accuracy is a pressing concern for wearables. Cohort studies suggest that optical sensors of heart rate, used commonly in smartwatches, may be less accurate on darker skintones.23Colvonen P.J. Response To: Investigating sources of inaccuracy in wearable optical heart rate sensors.npj Digit Med. 2021; 4: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar When considering the limitations to diversity and equity observed in clinical research and technology sectors, problems such as these are not surprising: when validation studies are performed on homogenous groups, confounders that would be identified with more diverse samples are overlooked. The field must bear in mind the troubling possibility that other group-level discrepancies in accuracy exist that have not yet been identified (eg, age or medical conditions). The speed with which new sensing modalities and scoring algorithms are added contributes to this challenge, as new group-level differences in accuracy can be unknowingly introduced. We urge researchers to include benchmarking of wearable-assessed metrics against data obtained using laboratory-grade equipment in research designs whenever possible, so that latent group-based discrepancies in accuracy can be swiftly identified. Disparities in technology access and usability also warrant empirical examination. Like other areas of digital health,24Richardson S. Lawrence K. Schoenthaler A.M. Mann D. A framework for digital health equity.npj Digit Med. 2022; 5: 119Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar barriers to the accessibility and usability of wearables include socioeconomic status, access to Wi-Fi, technology literacy, and individual differences (eg, persons who are blind or persons who have a physical disability). The implication of these barriers is that, in the scaling up of wearable implementation, people who are already experiencing healthcare inequities are also the most likely to be left behind. Without empirical attention, this could ultimately affect the accessibility of health care more broadly. For example, consider recent efforts to integrate wearable-assessed data (eg, step count) into workplace health insurance incentive programs.25Soliño-Fernandez D. Ding A. Bayro-Kaiser E. Ding E.L. Willingness to adopt wearable devices with behavioral and economic incentives by health insurance wellness programs: results of a US cross-sectional survey with multiple consumer health vignettes.BMC Public Health. 2019; 19: 1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar Although walking is a generally salutary behavior, some individuals may be unable to attain an incentivized step count owing to a health condition. This well-intended policy could thus have the consequence of leaving individuals who are most in need of health care to pay more for insurance than peers without a pre-existing condition. Wearables have been touted for offering the possibility of low-cost population-level screening and early diagnosis for common conditions such as atrial fibrillation.4Brandes A. Stavrakis S. Freedman B. et al.Consumer-led screening for atrial fibrillation: frontier review of the AF-SCREEN International Collaboration.Circulation. 2022; 146: 1461-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar If proven effective, this would constitute a groundbreaking advance for public health. On the contrary, potential negative system-level affects must also be investigated, such as increased health costs associated with follow-up testing and health risks from complications from unnecessary procedures. With over 27 million Americans uninsured in 2022,26Cohen RA, Cha AE. Health insurance coverage: Early release of estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, January-June 2022. National Center for Health Statistics. December 2022. Published online 2022.Google Scholar many wearable users may lack access to affordable follow-up care altogether. For those uninsured, follow-up testing for a wearable-detected false positive can have lasting financial consequences (eg, medical debt) that may affect health and future health care utilization. There is also a paucity of data about how wearable adoption affects how people use health care. There is evidence to suggest that increased personal monitoring may contribute to overutilization among individuals who develop health anxiety,5Rosman L. Gehi A. Lampert R. When smartwatches contribute to health anxiety in patients with atrial fibrillation.Cardio Vasc Digit Health J. 2020; 1: 9-10https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvdhj.2020.06.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and it follows that wearable use may otherwise affect when and why people go to their general practitioner and what they discuss at appointments. In future controlled trials of wearables for diagnosis and screening, undesired effects on health care utilization and the cost of care should be empirically characterized. Finally, data about the impacts on providers of the implementation of wearables into existing health care systems are needed. Concerns about wearables raised by providers in qualitative investigations9Runkle J. Sugg M. Boase D. Galvin S.L. Coulson C.C.

Many of the negative individual-level outcomes described here may be prevented or addressed when wearables are used in collaboration with a professional, but data are needed to characterize the actual availability and implementation potential of this kind of care. Providers' willingness and ability to discuss wearable usage with their patients may be contingent on the demands of specific practice contexts, and the burden placed on providers may also vary by use context (eg, whether use is patient-initiated or initiated at the recommendation of a provider). Given the number and heterogeneity of wearable devices and how frequently sensor technologies and scoring algorithms change, there are also clear obstacles to providers' ability to stay current on the nuances of individual devices. Moreover, many providers may lack knowledge about how to assess for and manage negative health effects associated with wearables use. Consumer health wearables have been recognized for their promise to revolutionize how people monitor and manage their health. Indeed, a rapidly accumulating literature suggests efficacy for the use of wearables for some health goals and conditions.1Bayoumy K. Gaber M.

The Face of Technology-Facilitated Aggression in New Zealand: Exploring Adult Aggressors' Behaviors,2021,"Abstract The nature and extent of adults' engagement in diverse manifestations of technology-facilitated aggression is not yet well understood. Most research has focused on victimization. When explored, engagement in online aggression and abuse has centered on children and young people, particularly in school and higher education settings. Drawing on nationally representative data from New Zealand adults aged 18 and over, this chapter explores the overall prevalence of online aggression with a focus on gender and age. Our findings support the need to also understand adult aggressors' behaviors to better address the distress and harm caused to targets through digital communications. The chapter discusses the implications of the results for policy and practice and proposes some directions for future research.

Introduction The Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (HDCA) is New Zealand's main legal response to online and technology-mediated abuses such as bullying, harassment, and intimidation. Its purpose is not only to deter, prevent, and mitigate harm caused through digital communications but also to provide those affected with a quick and efficient means of redress (Harmful Digital Communications Act [HDCA], 2015). The development of the HDCA (2015) became a legislative priority after the New Zealand Law Commission's 2012 review of the adequacy of existing legislation. Critically, this review concluded that abuse facilitated through digital technologies was emotionally more harmful than in the pre-digital era and that there were gaps in legal sanctions for perpetrators and in access to meaningful remedies for those experiencing such abuse (Law Commission, 2012). The HDCA (2015) is based on 10 communications principles. Nine of the principles were derived from a range of pre-existing New Zealand laws, while one was new. The principles are intended to articulate these laws and rules in a form that is accessible to general internet users. In this sense, the HDCA (2015) states that a digital communication should not be, for example, threatening, intimidating, or menacing; should not be indecent or obscene; and should not make a false allegation. Together these principles provide a general framework for describing and identifying types of online abuse such as cyberbullying, cyberstalking, image-base sexual abuse, and online hate speech, among others. In addition, the HDCA (2015) introduced some new legal responses to online aggression. One of these responses is the inception of civil court orders for a serious and/or repeated breach of the communication principles. It also introduced a criminal offense – sanctioned with fines and/or imprisonment – that makes it illegal to post a digital communication with the intention to cause harm or that actually causes harm to the victim (see HDCA, 2015). The HDCA (2015) defines harm as “serious emotional distress” (HDCA, 2015, p. 4). In a briefing to the New Zealand Parliament, the Ministry of Justice (2014) explained that serious emotional distress sets a relatively high threshold to ensure that subjective accounts of embarrassment, anxiety, worry, or outrage are not enough to trigger enforcement of the law. Another key innovation of the HDCA (2015) is the establishment of the Approved Agency as part of the civil regime to be the first port of call for complaints and to assist New Zealand internet users in dealing with harm and distress caused through any form of digital communication. The Approved Agency does not have powers of sanction but uses advice, negotiation, mediation, and persuasion to resolve complaints. If the Approved Agency cannot resolve the complaint brought to it by an individual, then that person may apply to the courts for a civil order. As a result, the defendant might be required to take down or disable the material, desist from engaging in the behavior concerned, publish a correction or provide a right of reply, and/or publish an apology. In 2016, Netsafe (www.netsafe.org.nz) was appointed as the Approved Agency under the HDCA (2015). Netsafe is an incorporated society formed in 2001. Its designated role complements the educational, incident response, and advisory services it provides to New Zealand's internet users, government, and commercial and community organizations. Netsafe also generates research-based evidence that informs the development of its support services and online safety resources while helping to close the knowledge gap in New Zealand – the authors of this chapter are part of Netsafe's Policy and Research team. From November 2016 to December 2019, Netsafe received 5,835 complaints from adults aged 18 years old and over (Netsafe, 2020). Of these, 62% were received from women, 36% from men, and 2% from people identifying as gender diverse. However, in 401 of these cases that Netsafe assessed as being the most serious – in terms of the breach of principles and potential to cause harm – the proportion of women making a complaint increased to 69% (with 31% men and 1% gender diverse). In relation to the ages of those who reported their complaint to Netsafe, 61% were 40 years old and under, rising to 67% in the most serious instances (Netsafe, 2020). Meanwhile, since the inception of the HDCA (2015), figures from the justice system show that, until June 2019, a total of 253 people were charged with criminal offenses that fall under the umbrella of the HDCA principles. Of this number, 85% were males and 15% females, with similar proportions subsequently being convicted (88% male and 12% female). In relation to age, the data shows that 90% of those charged and convicted were aged 44 years or younger (Ministry of Justice, 2019). Data relating to civil claims under the HDCA (2015) are not currently publicly available. The HDCA (2015) is a key legal instrument helping to address and sanction aggression and abuse online. However, a legislative response is not enough to prevent hurtful behaviors, reduce victimization, and mitigate harm. We suggest that research-based evidence to also support preventive interventions would significantly improve the safety of New Zealand internet users. However, research to date in the country has focused solely on victimization in the context of children and young people (Pacheco & Melhuish, 2018). Research-based evidence about the nature and extent of adults who engage in different forms of online aggression and their motivations for doing so is lacking in the country (see Background section for details). Creating new knowledge about adult perpetrators and victims can help to develop policy and programming to address and prevent matters of public concern in which digital technologies play a facilitative or mediating role, such as the live streaming video of the Christchurch terrorist attack and incidents of family and sexual violence in which technology is used to reproduce control and abuse. Research-based evidence can also help in developing contextually-appropriate interventions that distinguish between situations where individuals have consensually engaged with others in activities and exchanges (e.g., the sending of sexual images or making sexual advances) and situations where the behaviors are engaged in nonconsensually and/or were or ought to have been known to the perpetrator to have been unwelcome. Among other things, quantitative studies such as the one reported on here can play an important role in better understanding the sorts of context-specific inquiries that will need to be made in subsequent qualitative research. In an effort to address the knowledge gap highlighted above, this chapter reports on aspects of the Annual Population Survey (APS), a quantitative study developed by Netsafe. The analysis presented here is guided by two underpinning research questions relating to APS data: RQ1- What is the prevalence of engagement in technology-facilitated aggression (TFA) among adult New Zealanders in the prior year in the context of age and gender? RQ2- What are the characteristics of TFA in relation to aggressors' motivations, their choice of the target(s), and whether their behavior was connected with a wider issue happening offline? This chapter has been organized in the following way. It first summarizes available literature about adults and TFA in New Zealand and overseas, pointing out the research focus on victimization and young people, and the need to explore engagement in aggression based on key demographic variables. The chapter then describes the methodological approach, and the subsequent section deals with our study findings about the prevalence and extent of TFA. The last section discusses the implications of the findings for policy, practice, and research. Background Technology-Facilitated Aggression: Victimization in New Zealand New Zealand research on diverse forms of aggression and abuse online is limited but growing. Similar to international trends, most studies have explored children and teenagers' experiences of online risks and harm, in large part, because of public concern (and news media's anxiety) around the dangers of technology (Pacheco & Melhuish, 2020). However, in recent years, researchers have turned their focus to adults as well. In this respect, some studies have looked at online harassment among New Zealand members of Parliament (Every-Palmer, Barry-Walsh, & Pathé, 2015), cyberbullying in the workplace in general (Gardner et al., 2016) or in more specific contexts such as within the health system (D'Souza, Catley, Tappin, & Forsyth, 2019; Minton, Birks, Cant, & Budden, 2018). While relevant, these studies do not provide measures matching the characteristics of the country's population as a whole. Just a few large-scale quantitative studies exploring personal experiences of specific forms of online aggression and abuse among adults can be found in the New Zealand-based literature. One study explored the prevalence of cyberbullying with a focus on gender (Steiner-Fox et al., 2016), while another conducted by Netsafe looked at the extent of image-based sexual abuse (Pacheco, Melhuish, & Fiske, 2019). In addition, researchers have started reporting and analyzing annual measures of the incidence of online hate speech victimization and exposure (see Pacheco & Melhuish, 2019). Further, a 2017 study by Netsafe explored the prevalence and impact of harmful digital communications, finding that a third of adult New Zealanders received in the prior year at least one type of unwanted online content (Pacheco & Melhuish, 2018). Even with this increasing attention to adults, research has largely concentrated on victimization and the target's perceived impact of online aggression and abuse. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there are no New Zealand-based data on the prevalence of adults' self-reported engagement in diverse forms of online aggression, also referred to here as technology-facilitated aggression (TFA). This knowledge gap limits the understanding of TFA and can hinder the impact of policy as well as the effective delivery of services and support to those who have been targeted. People's Engagement in Technology-Facilitated Aggression Notably, the paucity in New Zealand of quantitative inquiry on adults' engagement in TFA on the basis of representative data is in keeping with a similar pattern overseas (Henry, Flynn, & Powell, 2019; Henry & Powell, 2018; Jenaro, Flores, & Frías, 2018). At best, available research on specific aspects of TFA has largely centered on emerging adults and been small in scale. For instance, the few studies on cyberbullying “perpetration” have centered on tertiary students (see Barlett, Chamberlin, & Witkower, 2017; Bauman & Baldasare, 2015; Doane, Pearson, & Kelley, 2014) as researching this population group is more accessible for academics. Research on sexting, cyber dating, and cyberstalking has been similarly focused (see Borrajo, Gámez-Guadix, & Calvete, 2015; Deans & Bhogal, 2019; Gámez-Guadix, Almendros, Borrajo, & Calvete, 2015; Garcia et al., 2016). Relying on convenience sampling is a valid research approach (Bryman, 2008) and focusing on the experiences of young people in tertiary education also helps to understand the extent of TFA in a specific social setting. However, policy makers and practitioners also need research-based evidence that is closely aligned with the entire population group to answer emerging social science and policy questions such as those regarding engagement in TFA. Further, the role of gender as a predictor of adults' engagement in TFA is not yet well understood. Some studies have found an association between gender and some forms of online aggression. For instance, in a nationwide Australian study, males (13.7%) were more likely to engage in image-based sexual abuse than females (7.4%) (see Henry et al., 2019). Similar trends have been reported in regard to cyber dating abuse and sexting among younger adults (see Deans & Bhogal, 2019; Morelli, Bianchi, Baiocco, Pezzuti, & Chirumbolo, 2016; Wick et al., 2017). Furthermore, an American study reported that, while men and women are equally likely to be harassed online, women have to deal with a wider and more serious variety of abuse online (Lenhart, Ybarra, Zickuhr, & Price-Feeney, 2016). However, others suggest that, compared to young men, young women are more likely to engage in controlling or monitoring online behaviors (see Bennett, Guran, Ramos, & Margolin, 2011; Burke, Wallen, Vail-Smith, & Knox, 2011). At the same time, some have found no strong link between gender and engagement in online aggression and abuse related to cyber dating (Borrajo et al., 2015) and interpersonal surveillance (Tokunaga, 2011). However, while Garcia et al.’s (2016) study on sexting and single adults in the United States (US) did not find a gender link among young people, it did so among older adults, with males being more likely to share a nude image than females. Understanding the nature and extent of engagement in TFA is a critical component for effective online safety interventions. Recently, academics and the technology industry have been trying innovative approaches such as machine learning to detect and remove online aggression (BBC, 2019). Such computational approaches have a reactive role to deal with incidents. However, proactive responses are also needed, and they require research-based evidence to inform the development of interventions aimed at preventing the different forms of TFA and better understanding the circumstances in which adults engage in certain types of behaviors often associated with TFA. Method The findings for this chapter come from the APS, a self-report study which gathers data from New Zealanders aged 18 and over. It was developed by Netsafe based on its extensive operational experience in online safety, the Communications Principles of the HDCA (2015), and in consultation with key stakeholders. The APS covers a range of topics regarding people's experiences of and attitudes toward unwanted digital communications and other online experiences as well as the potential harm they might cause. Colmar Brunton, a research firm, was contracted to distribute the instrument via email between 4 and 26 June 2019 using independent online research panels for a population-based cross-sectional survey. Online surveys are increasingly used in the social sciences. They are less expensive and easier to administer than paper-based surveys. Moreover, online surveys are useful for exploratory research, particularly on topics regarding people's online activities and behaviors (Garcia et al., 2016; Henry & Talbot, 2019; Lenhart et al., 2016; Pacheco et al., 2019; Pacheco & Melhuish, 2017; Powell & Henry, 2019). The sample was structured to be representative of the population in terms of age and gender. Data were weighted using key population targets drawn from New Zealand's 2013 Census data (Stats NZ, 2015). The maximum margin of error for the whole results is +/− 3.1% at 95% confidence. The response rate was 28%. There were a total of 1,161 participants. Participants received an email with detailed information about the nature and purpose of the study and gave their consent to participate. Two email reminders were sent during fieldwork. Participants were also incentivized through a point-based reward system when they completed the survey. In terms of gender, females represented 51.7% of the total sample while males made up 47.9%. Only 0.4% of participants identified as gender diverse. Regarding age groups, participants were distributed as follows: 18–29 years old (20.9%), 30–39 years old (16.4%), 40–49 years old (18.9%), 50–59 years old (17.5%), 60–69 years old (13.6%), and 70 years old and older (12.6%). For this chapter, only data regarding participants' self-reported engagement in behaviors often associated with TFA are presented and discussed. Descriptive statistics were used to present quantitative accounts or summaries of what the data show about the sample and the measures (Trochim & Donnelly, 2007) in the context of gender and age. Thus, broad patterns are discussed in the chapter only when findings are statistically significant. Due to the sensitive nature of the research topic, the authors ensured that special attention was paid to research ethics at all stages of the study. Participants' informed consent was obtained after providing them with information about the purpose of the survey, what would be involved, and how collected data would be used and protected. The authors ensured that the Colmar Brunton Social Research Team administering the online survey followed ethical protocols to respect and protect participants' safety and rights to take part in and/or withdraw from the study. Moreover, contact information for support services, such as Netsafe's helpline, was also provided to the participants. In addition, the APS questionnaire was sensitively worded, cognitively tested, and piloted to identify any risk of causing distress to the participants. Although this study provides new insights into adult New Zealanders' engagement in TFA, it has limitations that need to be mentioned. First, a potential issue relates to social desirability bias in the self-reported data provided by the participants (Bryman, 2008), meaning that some might not have disclosed their engagement in TFA and instead provided socially desirable answers. Second, despite surveying the sending of unwanted digital communications, some of the listed behaviors that participants were asked about may have taken place in consensual contexts where the behavior of the participant was not considered harmful (and perhaps was even welcomed) by the recipient (e.g., making a sexual advance, sending a sexual image). Since it can be difficult for quantitative instruments to delve deeply into context, future qualitative research could be beneficial for better understanding these contextual nuances. Third, although our gender measure allowed participants to identify themselves within the broad category of gender diverse, only 0.4% did so. Thus, arriving at statistically relevant conclusions for this sub-group was not possible. Fourth, a relatively small number of respondents reported engaging in listed behaviors, thereby limiting the possibility for broad generalizations about particular types of behavior within the population as a whole. Finally, as previously mentioned, data were weighted using the 2013 census data (Stats NZ, 2015). At the time of carrying out data processing and reporting, the 2018 census data were not yet available. Findings Engagement in Technology-Facilitated Aggression To answer the first research question about engagement in TFA, participants were asked whether in the last 12 months they had undertaken a range of behaviors online toward someone else. These involved sending or sharing digital communications that (1) physically threatened someone, (2) attempted to get someone excluded from a friendship group, (3) tried to embarrass someone, (4) said offensive things about someone (e.g., the way they look, how they behave, or what they believe in), (5) posted or sent violent or sexual content, (6) made a false statement about someone's personal or professional life, (7) made a sexual advance toward someone (e.g., messages about sex, naked selfies, images, or video live stream), (8) regularly monitored someone's online activity in order to influence their behavior or thoughts, (9) shared intimate images or recordings of someone without their permission, (10) encouraged other people to send hurtful messages to someone else, or (11) tried to get someone to hurt themselves. The response options for each of these behaviors included: No, Yes – once, and Yes – more than once. The overall prevalence of TFA was obtained by aggregating the responses of participants who engaged at least in one of these behaviors. In general, of all the participants (n = 1,161), over 1 in 10 (11.4%) disclosed having sent or shared at least one type of offensive or abusive digital communication to someone else (one or more times) in the last 12 months (Table 6.1). What is more, 2.5% reported posting hurtful content online only once while 8.9% did so more than one time. The study also found that, in regard to gender, males (16.5%) were more likely to engage in the listed behaviors compared to females (6.6%). Regarding age, sending or sharing an offensive digital communication was more common among younger adults, particularly for those aged 18–29 (19.8%), followed by 30–39 and 40–49 years old, 19.4% and 12.0%, respectively. Table 6.1. Adult New Zealanders' Overall Engagement in TFA by Gender and Age. Sample TFA Aggression Male 556 (47.9%) 16.5% Female 501 (51.7%) 6.6% 18–29 243 (20.9%) 19.8% 30–39 190 (16.4%) 19.4% 40–49 219 (18.95) 12.0% 50–59 203 (17.5%) 5.6% 60–69 158 (13.6%) 5.1% 70 or older 147 (12.6%) 1.5% Total 1,161 11.4% Furthermore, our results also show which of the listed behaviors were more common among participants. In this respect, as Table 6.2 depicts, posting or sharing content that said offensive things (6%) was the most common form of TFA. Less common were sharing content that sought to embarrass someone, attempted to get someone excluded from a friendship group, was a sexual advance toward someone, was violent or sexual, or encouraged other people to send hurtful messages to someone (3% for each of them). Meanwhile, 2% was the rate for each of the remaining behaviors included in our typology of TFA. These included behaviors that monitored someone's online activity, physically threatened someone, shared intimate images or recordings without permission, was a false statement about someone's personal or professional life, and tried to get someone to hurt themselves. Table 6.2. Prevalence of Each Type of TFA by Gender and Age.

Rates for some types were more significant statistically than others. For instance, 9% of males indicated to have posted offensive things about someone compared to 3% of females. Also, posting online content that attempted to get someone excluded from a friendship group was higher among males (6%) than females (1%). In terms of age, posting content that said offensive things about someone was more common among 18–29 and 40–49 years old, with rates at 8% for each of these age groups. Meanwhile, those aged 30–39 were more likely to send content online with the intention of getting someone excluded from a friendship group. The Target of Technology-Facilitated Aggression To explore the extent and nature of TFA, participants who indicated they had engaged in at least one of the listed behaviors in the prior year (n = 140) were asked a follow-up question about who the target was. The response scale included: (a) a family member, (b) a friend, (c) a colleague/past colleague, (d) an acquaintance – someone who is part of their wider peer group, (e) other, and (f) none of the above. As Table 6.3 depicts, 29% of targets were a friend, followed by a family member (20%). In addition, 13% of those targeted were strangers to the participants while 12% said they targeted a colleague or past colleague. In terms of gender, it was more common for males (33%) to target a friend compared to females (20%). In contrast, targeting a family member was more common among female participants (30%) than males (16%). Regarding age, 49% of participants aged 30–39 indicated having sent or shared an offensive communication to or with a friend, while 26% of those aged 18–29 did so too. Furthermore, young participants aged 18–29 (26%) were more likely to target a family member than their 30–39 years old peers (21%). Interestingly, targeting a stranger was more common among older adults aged 40 and over. Table 6.3. The Target of TFA by Gender and Age. Sample Size Friend Family Member Stranger Current/Past Colleague Acquaintance Other None of These Male 86 33% 16% 11% 18% 4% – 18% Female 51 20% 30% 17% – 8% 2% 23% 18–29 58 32% 26% 10% 1% 8% 1% 21% 30–39 38 49% 21% 4% 18% 5% – 3% 40–49 19 – 9% 19% 23% 4% 1% 44% 50–59 13 29% 2% 33% 1% 4% – 31% 60–69 8 2% 42% 20% 33% 4% – – 70 or older 4 69% – – 19% – 6% 5% Total 140 29% 20% 13% 12% 5% 1% 20% Reasons for Engaging in Technology-Facilitated Aggression The survey also asked these participants about the main reason that motivated them to engage in the listed behaviors. To indicate their responses, participants were provided with the following items: (1) to embarrass the person, (2) to influence their behavior or thoughts, (3) to scare them, (4) to get revenge or get back at them, (5) for sexual pleasure, (6) for a joke, (7) to get money from them, (8) to get more images or videos from them, (9) other, and (10) don't know. When asked about the reason for their behavior, just over a quarter (28%) of respondents (n = 140) said their communications were designed and sent as a joke (Table 6.4). The second most common reason was to influence their target's behavior or thoughts (14%). Less common reasons reported by the participants were to scare the target (8%), to embarrass them (6%), to get revenge (4%), or to get money from them (3%). While 19% said there were other reasons, 16% did not know the motivation behind their behavior. Interestingly, compared to males (23%), females (40%) were more likely to send an offensive communication as a joke. In contrast, for males it was more common to do so to influence their target's behavior or thoughts, to scare them, to embarrass them, and to get revenge. In terms of age, it is noticeable that for a significant proportion of participants aged 18–29 (61%) their behavior was intended as a joke. While a third of those aged 30–39 years old (33%) indicated not knowing what the motivation for their action was, 32% of those aged 40–49","['face', 'technology-facilitated', 'aggression', 'zealand:', 'exploring', 'adult', ""aggressors'"", 'behaviors']"
Digitally acquired recreational computer programming activity and its association with bipolar disorder mood episodes,2023,"K.T. is a single, 43-year-old computer engineer who initially presented for psychiatric assessment because of depressive symptoms which had worsened over the previous year. He reported becoming more hopeless, amotivated, experienced difficulty getting out of bed in the mornings, with reduced appetite (but weight gain), initial insomnia, early morning wakening, poor concentration, difficulty making decisions, suicidal thoughts (without plans), anergia, diurnal mood variation and greater social isolation, which were consistent with a diagnosis of a melancholic depressive episode. There was a past psychiatric history of a depressive episode at age 23 associated with an unsuccessful attempt at carbon monoxide poisoning. Since that time he had been treated with venlafaxine 75 mg mane and had been 'getting along ok'. This had more recently been increased to 225 mg mane but had been ineffective. There was a history of social anxiety since a teen. He denied a past history of mania/hypomania, psychosis or deliberate self-harm. His medical history was unremarkable and he was otherwise in good health. There was concurrent alcohol abuse of up to six standard drinks 5 days/week which he says assisted with insomnia—he denied physical withdrawal symptoms. He was a smoker (five cigarettes/day). K.T.'s premorbid personality was somewhat 'obsessional'. Developmentally he reported his younger brother experienced a near-drowning as a toddler and remained severely disabled with a brain injury until his death at age 19. There was no family history of mental illness. In addition to working, K.T. was very dedicated to recreational computer programming in his free time, which he considered 'non-work' work. He had for many years used a program to automatically log his daily programming activity via an online platform. The day's activity was graphically represented on a public website with five increments from 'less' through to 'more' via a heatmap (Figure 1). This heatmap logs activity based on the number, n, of contributions from zero upwards. A grey square indicates '0' contributions and increasingly darker green squares indicate more contributions. The total annual number of contributions is also provided in Figure 1. Additionally, Figure 1 details mood state (depression, partially treated depression, mania/hypomania and euthymia) as well as formal employment status across the time period 2018–2022. In 2018, K.T. was predominantly depressed—he was treated with increasing doses of venlafaxine and with mirtazapine augmentation (and later with the addition of olanzapine) with only a partial response, associated with many periods of zero activity as shown on the heatmap (Figure 1, 2018). Early in 2019, K.T. was hospitalised and his antidepressant was switched to amitriptyline 100 mg daily, with mood improvement—coinciding with an increase in programming activity in March and April (Figure 1, 2019). As his mood declined in May (associated with little heatmap activity) lithium augmentation was trialled which improved productivity in June but the combination lost effectiveness and was associated with very little programming for the rest of the year despite escalating amitriptyline doses. Methylphenidate was added as an augmenting agent in January 2020 and there was a marked increase in heatmap activity in March (Figure 1, 2020). In April, it became evident that K.T. was hypomanic (with features of talkativeness, increased energy and confidence, distractibility and spontaneous laughing). Methylphenidate was ceased, amitriptyline was reduced and olanzapine was temporarily added. His heatmap activity continued to be elevated in May with increased programming activity at which time amitriptyline was withdrawn and in June hypomania resolved (Figure 1). It was unclear if this episode of mood elevation was indicative of an underlying bipolar disorder (BP) or whether it was the result of overstimulation secondary to the addition of the psychostimulant. K.T.'s mood soon worsened, and clomipramine was trialled owing to the presence of both depressive symptoms and marked obsessional features. The heatmap shows little activity associated with his mood worsening and in August, he was admitted to the hospital for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). He was initially treated with right unilateral 0.5 ms pulse width (later increased to 1.0 ms) before converting to bitemporal electrode placement. He underwent a total of 25 treatments with ketamine eventually added as an anaesthetic to augment the ECT. His mood improved and he was discharged from the hospital. Soon after discharge, K.T. developed an elevated mood (he was accelerated, talkative, with reduced sleep and poor concentration). This was associated with auditory hallucinations (e.g. a child screaming, 'electrical buzzing') and functional hallucinations (e.g. 'when the shower is running, I can hear the neighbour's music playing very loudly'). He was again treated with olanzapine which settled the mania and perceptual disturbances. Given the clear manic psychotic episode, he was re-diagnosed as having a bipolar I disorder. He again became depressed and lamotrigine was added to lithium and clomipramine. Lurasidone was trialled but ceased owing to akathisia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intermittent theta burst stimulation were trialled but both were ineffective. Overall, the annual number of contributions was markedly higher at 1073, compared to the previous 2 years, where it was 281 and 321 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Tranylcypromine (Parnate) was added in August 2021. From that time on, heatmap data (Figure 1, 2021) indicate greater levels of programming as well as consistency in activity into 2022 with the total number of contributions increasing to 2061. This was associated with 'inspiration coming back' and being able to work 4 h/day. By October 2021, he felt 'fully productive', working 8 h/day across multiple projects. In association with the introduction of tranylcypromine he was undergoing structured psychological therapy which involved a graded increase in work activity. K.T. remains euthymic on a combination of lithium, lamotrigine and tranylcipramine and is working productively across the week (Figure 1, 2022). BP impacts functioning and productivity with a systematic review of economic analyses of US data finding that about half (50.3%) of the non-medical costs of BP I related to unemployment with a further 6.4% due to productivity loss.1 This case gives a clear clinical example of bipolar mood episodes markedly impacting productivity related to recreational computer programming. The current case study examines recreational functioning in relation to mood episodes and highlights the potential usefulness of daily digital data acquisition of recreational or work activity in patients with BP. Productivity may be a proxy for affective state—being markedly reduced or absent during depressive periods, increased during manic/hypomanic periods and more stable and consistent during euthymia. A cross-sectional survey of BP I patients found that compared to age- and gender-matched healthy individuals, the former group reported lower levels of work productivity (as measured by the Endicott Workplace Productivity Scale), were more likely to miss work, have worked reduced hours due to mental health or medical issues, receive disability payments, or have been fired from their job.2 In another study, Simon et al.3 examined 441 outpatients with BP and found depression was strongly and consistently associated with decreased probability of employment and more days missed from work due to illness. However, they found symptoms of mania/hypomania demonstrated more variable effects on work productivity. Long-term clinical monitoring of BP is a useful method to track therapeutic stability. There is growing interest in digital data acquisition from technologies such as computers or smartphones including via 'apps' (i.e. applications)—with monitoring of domains such as sleep and activity levels that are relevant to BP (see systematic review by Ortiz et al.4). For example, Faurholt-Jepsen et al.5 sought to examine automatically generated objective data relating to patient phone calls and text messages (i.e. number and duration) as well as self-monitored data (e.g. mood, sleep duration, activity levels) collected using smartphones. The authors found correlations between this data and clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms which also differed between affective states. In the current case, the ineffectiveness of medications can be observed where productivity dips and a stable response to medications is indicated by greater consistency and stability of output (and overall the highest annual programming contributions) once the patient was commenced on the combination of tranylcypromine, lithium and lamotrigine. The current case used passive data acquisition which has advantages over active means, as it is likely more reliable as well as being more convenient for the individual. Data acquisition in this case was specific to the patient's recreational computer programming, though with technological advances, it is possible to envisage digital data acquisition which is personalised to the individual's specific work or recreational context. While the current case study was retrospective, there is potential to develop an approach whereby an individual with BP could be provided objective feedback relating to a change in their activity (either increasing or decreasing) and which may serve as an early warning signal of a switch into a manic/hypomanic or depressive episode. Implications of such monitoring in the future could include integrating a broader set of patient data into artificial intelligence systems which could then inform proactive clinical decision-making with respect to patient management. For example, the earlier initiation of antidepressants, adjustment of doses of anti-manic agents, or use of hypnotics. Future studies could examine recreational or work productivity combined with other real-time data to explore whether this information could be utilised as an electronic biomarker of bipolar illness activity.

Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University,2020,"Medical Education Program Highlights Established in 1824, the Sidney Kimmel Medical College (SKMC) of Thomas Jefferson University (originally Jefferson Medical College) is a large, private medical college in Philadelphia. The first U.S. medical school to incorporate bedside teaching, SKMC has long held the reputation for producing superior clinical graduates. The school is distinguished in the quantity and depth of student community engagement. SKMC recently underwent a significant curricular redesign (JeffMD), transitioning from a 2 + 2 paradigm to a 3-phase program integrating fundamental science, clinical science, and health systems science (HSS) throughout all 4 years. Highlights: Varied pedagogical approaches with tight integration of clinical and scientific concepts in small groups and limited lecture hours Utilization of frequent low-stakes assessments Robust scholarly inquiry requirement for all students in one of several tracks: clinical and translational research, design, digital health, health policy and systems, humanities, medical education, population health Competency-based final curricular phase with pathways to teach and assess general and specialty competencies linked to graduate medical education milestones Home of the Jefferson Longitudinal Study of Medical Education Curriculum Curriculum description The JeffMD Curriculum consists of a preclerkship phase (Phase 1), core clerkship phase (Phase 2), and specialization phase (Phase 3). See Supplemental Digital Appendix 1—Curriculum Overview—at https://links.lww.com/ACADMED/A849. See Supplemental Digital Appendix 2—Curriculum Schematic With Structure and Sequencing—at https://links.lww.com/ACADMED/A849. Curriculum changes since 2010 JeffMD curriculum successfully launched in 2017 with complete implementation in 2021 Increased use of active learning techniques with > 40% reduction of lectures Customization opportunities via scholarly inquiry tracks and specialty pathways Centralization of curricular development, administration, assessment, and quality control Future changes: Expand assured admission programs to increase student body diversity Optimize application of HSS concepts through early clinical experiences Adopt competency-based assessment and learner advancement Class size changes since 2010 While class size has increased from approximately 260 to 270 students, JeffMD offers more opportunities for small-group active learning compared with our legacy curriculum. SKMC introduced a regional campus in 2017 that includes a 6-student longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC). Medical education program objectives Developed and adopted in 2000 with reference to AAMC Medical School Objectives Project Guidelines (2000), SKMC graduation competencies and linked medical education program objectives were revised in 2016 referencing AAMC core competencies and Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and ACGME transitional year milestones. See Table 1—Medical Education Program Objectives and Assessment Methods.Table 1: Medical Education Program Objectives and Assessment MethodsIn 2017, the SKMC Student Assessment Office was created to provide oversight of all student assessments. With launch of the JeffMD curriculum, SKMC developed the Jefferson Competency Assessment Tool (JeffCAT), a secure online platform that aggregates student assessment data from multiple modalities, providing an integrated portrait of student performance throughout the curriculum. JeffCAT benchmarks student performance to SKMC graduation competencies, EPAs, and ACGME milestones. Administrators and students can track progress longitudinally to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. For Phases 2 and 3, SKMC instituted the Jefferson Direct Observation Tool (JeffDOT), a mobile phone-based application for bedside use, to encourage frequent microassessments and track student progress. JeffDOT uses checklists that, in aggregate, are designed to stratify learners' skill level and provide evidence of progress toward workplace competence. Additional JeffMD assessment changes by phase are described below. Phase 1: Computer-based administration of assessments (quizzes, exams, case-based learning [CBL] peer assessments) through educational technology Weekly low-stakes quizzes to assess mastery of information Rubric grading for CBL, including peer and facilitator assessments Longitudinal tracking of student performance on the NBME Comprehensive Basic Science Self-Assessment over 3 administrations End-of-block, end-of-year 1, and end-of-Phase 1 OSCEs Phase 2: Work-based structured assessment of clinical skills longitudinally Project-based assessments in scholarly inquiry Additional end-of-clerkship OSCEs Integration of NBME subject exams into clerkship assessment structure End-of-clerkship evaluation mapped to SKMC competencies End-of-Phase 2 OSCE Phase 3: End-of-course evaluations mapped to SKMC competencies Project-based assessments in scholarly inquiry and advanced basic science courses Group simulation experiences Implementation of an end-of-Phase 3 OSCE Work-based structured assessment of clinical skills in required Phase 3 courses Parallel curriculum or tracks In 2017, SKMC launched the LIC at the Atlantic Health System, which emphasizes outpatient care, integration between disciplines, and longitudinal relationships with faculty and patients. SKMC plans to offer a 3-year graduation option for 8–12 students, linked with graduate programs at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH), beginning in 2021. Pedagogy Various pedagogical approaches are used throughout the 4-year curriculum. Simulation, standardized patients, lectures, and small- and large-group discussion are employed during all phases. Students have in-patient and ambulatory experiences in all phases. Peer teaching occurs during CBL and team-based learning (TBL) in Phase 1 and continues during patient rounds in Phases 2 and 3. Self-directed learning is specifically incorporated into CBL during the preclerkship phase and occurs routinely during the clinical curricular phases. Some pedagogical approaches are limited to specific phases. In Phase 1, the cornerstone of the curriculum is small-group CBL using a guided inquiry approach. TBL is extensively incorporated as well. The Phase 1 communication skills curriculum uses role plays and a preceptorship. Gross anatomy dissection and virtual microscopy labs occur in Phase 1 as well as during advanced basic science courses in Phase 3. SKMC moved from a predominantly lecture-based curriculum to a longitudinally integrated, case-based organ system curriculum requiring close collaboration between basic and clinical scientists. SKMC now uses more active learning approaches including CBL, TBL, audience response, flipped classrooms, and patient panels. A longitudinal scholarly inquiry track was added to teach and foster research principles; humanities selectives were expanded. Clinical experiences All required clinical experiences occur at either TJUH or one of several affiliated community-based academic medical centers. Each offers exposure to a diverse patient population and an opportunity to see medicine practiced in a variety of settings. Students can participate in one of our branch campus programs, which focus most clinical rotations at a particular community site. Christiana Care Health System in Delaware serves as a regional medical campus, providing students in the Delaware Branch Campus program with clinical experiences. Students enrolled at Main Line Health Branch Campus do most clinical rotations at the hospitals of the Main Line Health Systems. Students enrolled in the LIC complete their clinical requirements at the Atlantic Health System in New Jersey. However, most students will complete core clerkships at both TJUH and community-based academic affiliates. Required longitudinal experiences Students in the LIC receive longitudinal clinical exposure with a small host of dedicated preceptors in major specialties. All students have a 4-year scholarly inquiry longitudinal experience incorporating research projects and mentoring. Clinical experience first encounter SKMC students' first clinical exposure is 4 months into the first year, when they partner with community health workers at outpatient sites for first-hand exposure to the challenges patients face and ways social determinants affect patient care and health care delivery. Required and elective community-based rotations SKMC does not require any community-based rotations. However, most students complete at least part of their required core clerkships or fourth-year rotations at an affiliated community-based academic medical center. Challenges in designing and implementing clinical experiences for medical students Considerable effort is invested to maintain the number and quality of clinical sites for students to ensure they receive outstanding clinical teaching within the geographic area despite the high demand for clinical placements. Curricular Governance Decentralized curricular governance There is granular departmental involvement in core clerkships through the clerkship directors and coordinators, although there is central oversight of Phase 2. The LIC, due to significant administrative need and its location remote from the main campus, has considerable autonomy in its functions. Most of the educational budget is administered centrally, although a portion is within control of the departments. See Figure 1—Office of the Dean administrative organizational chart.Figure 1: Office of the Dean administrative organizational chart.Education Staff The office staff includes 1 vice dean, 1 senior associate dean, 3 associate deans including 1 dean of professionalism, 1 business manager, 2 administrative assistants, and 5 educational coordinators. A curriculum technology specialist performs curricular mapping, technologic tools training, and building/problem-solving with the learning management system. An assistant dean of assessment, director of student assessment, senior psychometrician, and 2 data analysts comprise the Undergraduate Medical Education Student Assessment Office. The Office of Academic Affairs works closely with the SKMC Center for Research in Medical Education and Health Care, particularly on the Jefferson Longitudinal Study of Medical Education. A faculty member is supported part time as phase director for each of the 3 phases of the curriculum, ensuring longitudinal integration and spiraling of content. The office is responsible for medical student curriculum planning and evaluation, student promotion and remediation processes, accreditation activities, and affiliate collaborations. The administrative faculty and staff in the office are responsible for undergraduate and graduate medical education. It is not responsible for areas outside of educational programming. See Figure 2—Curricular governance committees.Figure 2: Curricular governance committees.Faculty Development and Support in Education Professional development for faculty as educators The Office of Faculty Affairs and Faculty Development (OFAFD) provides a multifaceted faculty development program offered continuously across the academic year and features content across 3 thematic domains to assist faculty with their career advancement: effective teaching, research skills, and leadership and management. Curricular content is curated by an interdisciplinary, interprofessional cadre of faculty members across the 10 schools of the university. Content represents domains of expressed need for faculty skills, with a particular focus on pedagogy. The program includes a series of in-person workshops, with remote access for affiliate faculty. Sessions are recorded and archived, and remain available for asynchronous access. Faculty are eligible to earn continuing medical education credits for participation. In addition, a series of interactive modules in pedagogy are developed and made available for faculty. The OFAFD sponsors its annual signature Faculty Days Program, a full-day interprofessional multidisciplinary event consisting of presentations by and for Jefferson faculty who share their knowledge and strategies to improve teaching and learning for learners across the continuum. Most recently, to equip faculty with skills to facilitate CBL sessions in the setting of the revised curriculum, the OFAFD developed an immersive 4-part multimodal training program. Part 1 offered faculty a series of asynchronous modules covering principles of facilitation, including peer-vetted resources. Part 2 provided faculty with video recordings of actual CBL sessions modeled by seasoned faculty facilitators with medical students. Part 3, an in-person workshop, immersed faculty in a simulated CBL session, followed by a large-group debriefing. An optional Part 4, offered to faculty weeks before their first session (just-in-time), was executed through co-facilitation with expert facilitators. Role of teaching in promotion and tenure Faculty contributions to the educational mission of SKMC are heavily weighted in promotion and tenure decisions. Contributions to teaching are evaluated through faculty members' education and teaching portfolios, which are reviewed during appointment and promotion procedures. Excellence in teaching remains a critical criterion for promotion across all tracks at SKMC. Furthermore, educational scholarship can be leveraged for promotion and tenure decisions in scholarship-based tracks in the medical school. Regional Medical Campuses The Delaware Branch Campus offers all core clerkships, as well as required fourth-year rotations such as subinternships, to 6–8 students each academic year. The Atlantic Health System Branch Campus is the site for the LIC, enrolling 6 students each academic year; expansion up to 12 students per year is under consideration. Educational experiences across sites The Delaware Branch Campus Program and the LIC program are relatively local, allowing participating students to commute to the SKMC campus for required educational activities and assessments. Each clerkship has a single set of educational objectives that are reviewed annually with the branch campus clerkship site directors, who are accountable to the main clerkship directors. The LIC Program was designed to meet SKMC educational goals and objectives. Patient logs, with identical targets as those for the rest of the student body, are used to monitor clinical experiences. All students submit standard end-of-clerkship questionnaires after every clerkship and, at each site, the results of which are used to compare student experiences across sites and assure comparability of educational experiences. Finally, a student-run clerkship liaison program regularly queries the student body about their clinical experiences and reports their findings to the core clerkship phase director.","['sidney', 'kimmel', 'medical', 'college', 'thomas', 'jefferson', 'university']"
"Model for Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building",2019,"Abstract Purpose This article's purpose is to develop The Model for Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building (SARB). Design/Methodology/Approach Products and patents of methods and systems analysis was carried out in the fields of BIM application, Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building. Based on other researchers' findings, The SARB Model was proposed. Findings Analysis of the literature showed that traditional decisions on the informational modelling do not satisfy all the needs of smart building technologies owing to their static nature. The SARB Model was developed to take care of its efficiency from the brief stage to the end of its service life. Research Limitations/Implications The SARB Model was developed to take care of its efficiency from the brief stage to the end of its service life. The SARB Model does have some limitations: (1) the processes followed require the collection of much unstructured and semi-structured data from many sources, along with their analyses to support stakeholders in decision-making; (2) stakeholders need to be aware of the broader context of decision-making and (3) the proposal is process-oriented, which can be a disadvantage during the model's implementation. Practical Implications Two directions can be identified for the practical implications of the SARB Model. The initial expectation is the widespread installation of SARB Model within real estate and construction organisations. Furthermore, development of the SARB Model will be used to implement the ERASMUS+ project, ""Advancing Skill Creation to ENhance Transformation—ASCENT"" Project No. 561712-EPP-1-2015-UK-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.

Introduction The rapid development of information and communication technologies (hereafter – ICTs) in the world has opened up broad possibilities for their use in the construction sector. These have an essential impact on this sector, increasing its efficiency and competitiveness and improving the quality of construction and its management. One of the fundamental decisions related to the application of ICT in the construction sector and its rapid implementation in the world regards application of methods relative to digital construction principles and Building Information Modelling (BIM). The use of ICT in Europe's construction sector has grown rapidly in recent years. Numerous digital technologies are now accessible in the areas of construction, planning and management of buildings and they increase the competitiveness of companies. Many researchers have analysed BIM application capabilities (Scherer and Katranuschkov, 2018; Bosch-Sijtsema et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2017; Habibi, 2017; Kamel and Memari, 2019; Hoseini et al., 2017; Gerrish et al., 2017; Röck et al., 2018). For example, Lu et al. (2017) analyzed applications of BIM in supporting green building lifecycle process. Kamel and Memari (2019) reviewed a BIM's application in energy simulation. Gerrish et al. (2017) analyzed BIM application to building energy performance visualisation and management. Many researchers also have analyzed the application of multi criteria analysis methods in the BIM area (Guo and Wei, 2016; Oti et al., 2016; Oti and Tizani, 2015; Chen and Pan, 2016; Pavlovskis et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017; Amiri et al., 2017). There is a big need in the world to extend the use of BIM, to link design and construction with the area of building management. It is important that the building information collected during the first stages of the building's life will be maximised and adapted to the stage of use of the building, since the BIM models are of great value and provide maximum benefits during asset management (Liu and Issa, 2012). In this case, Model for Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building (SARB) were developed over the course of the ACSENT project No. 561712-EPP-1-2015-UK-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP research. To design and realise a high-quality SARB, it is necessary to take care of its efficiency from the brief stage to the end of its service life. The entire process should be planned and executed with consideration of the goals aspired to by the participating interested parties and the micro, meso and macro environmental levels. To realise the above purposes an original SARB Model and its smart BIM objects was developed by the authors to enable users and the parties involved in the project to analyze a SARB's life cycle, as well as to be able to see its micro, meso and macro environments as one integrated entity. This paper is structured as follows: the Introduction; Section 2 presents products and patents of methods and systems analysis; Section 3 describes the Model for Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building (SARB); Section 4 describes the innovativeness of SARB Model; and finally concluding remarks in Section 5. 2. Products and patents of methods and systems analysis There are a number of Building Management Systems (BMS) that are developed and used in smart buildings. These systems are manufactured and distributed by Carel, Regin, Danfoss, Remak, Honeywell, Siemens Systemar, VTS, Jung and many other companies. However, these systems are not linked to BIM. Autodesk (U.S.), AVEVA (U.K.), Bentley Systems, Incorporated (U.S.), GRAITEC (France), Intergraph Corporation (U.S.), Data Design System (Norway), IES Ltd. (U.K.), 4M Building Solutions (U.S.), Nemetschek Group (Germany), Trimble Inc., (U.S.) are some of the prominent players and are at the forefront of competition in the Global Building Information Modelling (BIM) Market (Zion Market Research 2017). Most of these companies offer BIM solutions for building design and construction phases, but only a small percentage for exploitation stage. Examples of the proposed similar to SARB Model products are presented in Table 1.

At least one input capture device is a mobile device with visual sensors. The cloud-based analytics platform automatically analyses received 2-Dimensional (2D) video and/or image inputs for generating 3-Dimensional (3D) surveillance data and providing 3D display for a target surveillance area Based on the analysis, there is no integrated solution, as proposed by SARB Model, developed worldwide. 3. Model for smart, self-learning and adaptive resilience building (SARB) The purpose for using SARB is to increasing of the disaster life cycle management of buildings at micro, meso and macro environmental levels. To solve this problem the novel, adaptive to the market Model for Smart, Self-Learning and Adaptive Resilience Buildings was developed (see Figure 1). The developed SARB Model allow real-time analysis of the building's disaster life cycle, evaluate the needs of users, create neuromatrixes and, based on them, would provide recommendations to building managers, users, builders and designers for resilience. Opens in a new window.Figure 1 Architecture of the SARB Model Different smart BIM objects are constitute the Model of a Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building (see Figure 2): Opens in a new window. Smart BIM objects Warnings and information subsystem. Subsystem would alert resident to potential issues in his/her area and around their home; warn homeowners when severe weather, such as tornadoes or flash floods; alert friends and contacts if help is needed and pick up alerts from news sources. Advisory subsystem. Advisory subsystem would provide immediate tips regarding transport, temporary shelter and food. Smart home devices subsystem. Smart home devices like water sensors would send alerts if water levels are rising in homes either through a water leak or even through a natural disaster. Those installed in vacation homes could keep his/her updated if those spaces have weathered potential water damage from a hurricane or not. Big data analytics. Big data analytics would accumulate data from various sensors and informational resources, analyze, determine different disaster management dependencies. Modelling subsystem. Modelling subsystem models disaster management phases and personal activities (prevention, mitigation strategy, preparedness, local emergency planning committees, preparedness measures, response, recovery). Modelling subsystem would provide multiple criteria analysis of different alternatives (saving and protecting human life; relieving suffering; protecting the health and safety; safeguarding the environment; protecting property; maintaining or restoring critical activities; promoting and facilitating self-help in affected communities; the recovery of the community (including the humanitarian assistance, economic, infrastructure and environmental impacts); recovery effort). Smart, self-learning, emotional affective computing, psychological and emotional assistance. This system would support the morale of the affected inhabitants and select in real time the most suitable film, music, lighting and the like for its users. Wearable system for enhancing the disaster management. Augmented reality system for disaster response. Its use in the context of disaster management is to represent different invisible disaster-relevant information (humans hidden by debris, simulations of damages and measures) and overlay it with the image of reality. Affective computing subsystem. Affective computing in disaster management is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognise, interpret, process and simulate human affects. The systems interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them, giving an appropriate response to those emotions. In addition, the affective computing can detect the different emotions in the text. Robots. Robots substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in any disaster management situation (finding survivors in unstable ruins, etc.) and for any purpose. Robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition and basically anything a human can do. Smart system for building structures. Smart system for building structures is defined as system that can automatically adjust structural characteristics, in response to the change in external disturbance and environments, toward structural safety and serviceability as well as the extension of structural service life. Increased safety – Sensors that detect whether concrete and other building infrastructure is successfully holding a load can increase safety and decrease the likelihood that a building or facility would collapse or otherwise become damaged. System modeling explosions and building collapse. IoT-based occupancy monitoring system. System estimate the occupancy in buildings to be used in emergency response. The Wi-Fi-based approach uses an intrusion detection tool to analyse Hypertext Transfer Protocol traffic and identify mobile devices that are connected. Fire and life safety system (FLS). System consists of the fire alarms, sensors, sprinklers, smoke purge and exhaust fans. The FLS typically connects to the local fire department and alarms. Traditionally, these systems were in separate conduits and cabling went from the control panel to the devices. Active disaster response system (ADRS). ADRS can actuate embedded controllers to perform emergency tasks to respond to the alerts. Examples of emergency tasks include opening doors and windows and cutting off power lines and gas valves. In addition, ADRS can maintain a temporary network by utilizing the embedded controllers; hence, victims trapped inside a building are still able to post emergency messages if the original network is disconnected. Occupant evacuation elevator. Elevator is applied for emergency evacuation, which would provide a faster and a safer evacuation program. Smart disaster management system. System simulate all the possible scenarios of emergency in the building and then, through the decision-making capability of the system, select the fastest and safest strategy of evacuation. Disaster resilience support with advance energy storage system. BIM. Call centre. The SARB Model aim is to create a unique technology that can provide user-friendly personalised conditions for building users by analysing user behaviour with neuro-analytical systems. Intelligent sensor systems and digital modelling tools that help you find rational multicriteria challenges are the key to maximising disaster life cycle of the buildings. By using innovative research methods, different smart BIM objects could collect data from various sensors and sources of information, analyse, identify various dependencies and supplement these data with BIM throughout the smart, self-learning and adaptive resilience building disaster life cycle process. 4. Innovativeness of SARB model Traditional decisions on the informational modelling do not satisfy all the needs of smart building technologies owing to their static nature. Current BIM systems lack information needed for developing a virtual environment capable of interactions with users (Heidari et al., 2014). The effort to eliminate the shortcomings of the traditional BIM requires a dynamic BIM that is relevant during the planning and exploitation stages in the life cycles of smart buildings (Volkov and Batov, 2015). This would permit a continual integration of progressive objects into a construction project and the maintenance of smart building elements with needed information (Zhang et al., 2015). Innovative, scientific research SARB Model could accumulate data from various sensors and information resources, analyse, determine various dependencies and supplement the BIM with such data over the entire course of the disaster life cycle of a smart building. All this information would enrich objects with knowledge about themselves and, at the same time, develop ""intelligent"" building elements, which can ""respond"" to requests and ""submit"" their existing information into a desirable form – graphically or digitally. This would permit the accumulation and use of knowledge about these elements over the entire disaster life cycle and provide recommendations to the target groups. The products and patents of methods and systems analysis was performed to substantiate this idea. This analysis showed that the SARB Model would be more advanced than the other models developed in the world. The distinguished features of innovativeness are the following: The model would accumulate biometric and physiological user data, integrate these for analysis with other data, determine various dependencies and supplement the BIM with these data over the entire process of the smart, self-learning and adaptive resilience building life process. Neuromatrixes would be developed permitting a comprehensive analysis of smart, self-learning and adaptive resilience building from quantitative, qualitative and neuro perspectives; the ability to compile and analyse thousands of alternatives for selecting the most rational one according to user needs and the establishment of the investment value of a building. No neuromatrix-based systems have been developed in the world capable of performing an analysis of a smart, self-learning and adaptive resilience building and providing recommendations. 5. Conclusions Analysis of the literature showed that traditional decisions on the informational modelling do not satisfy all the needs of smart building technologies owing to their static nature. There is also no integrated solution, as proposed by SARB Model, developed worldwide. In this case, the Model for Smart, Self-learning and Adaptive Resilience Building (SARB) was developed to take care of its efficiency from the brief stage to the end of its service life. Developed SARB Model enable users and the parties involved in the project to analyze a SARB's life cycle, as well as to be able to see its micro, meso and macro environments as one integrated entity. The proposed SARB Model could accumulate biometric and physiological user data, integrate these for analysis with other data, determine various dependencies and supplement the BIM with these data over the entire process of the smart, self-learning and adaptive resilience building life process. The SARB Model would allow real-time analysis of the building's disaster life cycle, evaluate the needs of users, create neuromatrixes and, based on them, would provide recommendations to building managers, users, builders and designers. Although the results are encouraging, the SARB Model developed in this study does have some limitations. Among them, the ones requiring highlighting are the following: (1) the processes followed require the collection of much unstructured and semi-structured data from many sources, along with their analyses to support stakeholders in decision-making; (2) stakeholders need to be aware of the broader context of decision-making; and (3) the proposal is process-oriented, which can be a disadvantage during the system's implementation.

Dislocation after disaster: What does ‘returning home’ mean?,2023,"The shock and disruption of an extreme event – an earthquake that shattered apartment buildings, shops, schools and hospitals, or a tsunami that virtually obliterates a city, or a flood that has washed away roadways, bridges and infrastructure – leaves an unforgettable impact on the affected community. With their homes ripped away, basic services like water, power and gas distribution systems damaged and dysfunctional, social institutions like mosques, churches and schools no longer able to serve the community, people leave devastated areas. “Just for a short time,” some tell themselves. “Only until we can rebuild,” others state tentatively. “The pain of loss is too great; we will never return,” still others assert. The dilemma of how to cope with the loss of physical infrastructure following a damaging event is compounded by the loss of the social connections, economic livelihoods and the landscape of familiar neighbourhoods, workplaces, personal artefacts and memories that give life meaning. This dilemma creates both personal and professional choices that cannot be ignored. Whatever choice is made will shape the next stage in the life of a family, a business, a neighbourhood, a city or the larger region that experienced the disaster. Yet, those choices are never made by individuals alone, and the choices regarding rebuilding physical infrastructure are taken in the context of how long it will take to rebuild the social and economic networks essential to give life meaning, and how thoughtfully the emotional content of what was lost can be reimagined into hopeful new beginnings. In Türkiye, this dilemma is occurring on multiple levels simultaneously after the Kahramanmaraş Earthquakes on 6 February 2023. The devastating earthquakes affected a vast area that included 11 provinces, 10 cities with smaller districts, towns, and villages and 13 million residents. At this point, over 3.5 million residents have left the area, and scattered across the country. Some refugees from conflict zones in Syria returned to Syria, after losing whatever stability they had gained in Turkish communities damaged by the earthquakes. The difficult plight of the Syrian refugees who were living in the earthquake-affected zone is discussed in more detail by Turkish authors Eda Sevinin, Didem Danış, Deniz Sert in their thoughtful commentary, Double Displacement of Refugees in the context of the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquake, this issue. Scientific studies are documenting with new detail the earthquake fault lines that traversed the region, mapping areas that will likely generate seismic risk again in a future decade or century. Seismic risk is a known risk; it will return, but no one knows exactly when, where or with what severity. Rebuilding a neighbourhood, a community, or a city after the disaster is a massive task; it cannot be done by individuals alone, or even cities or provinces alone. Attempts by national governments to create resettlement plans for survivors following extreme events have not always been successful, and for many displaced families, such centralized solutions have created living situations in which they are worse off than before the disaster. In her commentary, Melissa Quetulio-Navarra portrays the painful consequences of such a national program, Philippine's Housing Commitment as a Preventive Resettlement Strategy for Informal Settler Families, in this issue. The challenge is how can the complex effort of housing for damaged areas be designed to recreate a vital, livable, functioning community while residents remaining are still grieving and many have left, uncertain of a viable future. The choices involve a complex set of interconnected feedback loops. At the national level, if, as announced, a major investment is made in rebuilding housing, are there also funds for reconstructing the services of water, power and transportation needed to support the return of residents to occupy that housing? Will businesses return to previous locations to provide groceries, gasoline and garden tools without customers? Will residents have jobs to support their families if they do return? Which investment comes first, housing, lifeline services, businesses, schools or places of worship? These choices are also made at an individual level, as families weigh the cost and strain of rebuilding against the problematic status of living in a city under construction without access to adequate health, medical, employment and educational services. Türkiye has seen this dilemma before, but the hardwon lessons from the Marmara and Duzce Earthquakes in 1999 regrettably failed to translate newly designed policies and building codes into practice to build stronger, more resilient communities across the nation (Comfort, 2019). Such changes, if implemented, would have substantially avoided the bitter losses and enormous destruction incurred only 24 years later in the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes. Ironically, a slim, positive outcome may result from the dispersion of 3.5 million residents of the earthquake-affected region across Türkiye. They will likely share their experience with the horror of collapsed buildings, their inability to rescue loved ones calling them from under the rubble, their shattered hopes for lives lost and plans foregone with others in other areas of this country with high seismic risk. The 13 million residents of the earthquake-damaged region represent approximately 15 percent of the Turkish population of 84.6 million. This significant proportion of the population could articulate vividly the reality of seismic risk and engage others in demanding long-term investment in buildings and infrastructure that do not fail. Halvard Buhaug raises the question of ‘good’ vs. ‘bad’ displacement of the population following disaster events in his commentary, What's in a number? Some reflections on disaster displacement modelling, this issue. Türkiye, as an ancient civilization, has vivid evidence of seismic risk over the centuries in the ruins of once-thriving cities like Pergamon, Ephesus and historical sites in old Antakya that were likely lost to the powerful forces of earthquakes that ancient inhabitants likely did not recognize nor understand. Recurring devastation from natural hazards is not confined to Turkey, as Ahsan Kamal notes in his commentary, Climate and Migration, on repeated severe flooding over 150 years in Pakistan, this issue. In contrast, in 2023, the scientific and technical capacity of Türkiye has changed dramatically. The earthquake faults have been mapped; after the 1999 earthquakes, Türkiye has updated its building codes to the equivalent of those in California and Japan. There are 120,000 civil engineers in Türkiye who have the skills and knowledge to design and build buildings that withstand seismic shaking, as evidenced by newer buildings in Gaziantep and Kahramanmaraş that emerged from this latest earthquake sequence largely undamaged. As a middle income country, Türkiye likely has the economic capacity to redesign communities with new buildings that will not fail. Choices made today in the design, construction and renewal of the damaged region will shape the next decades of sustainability and resilience for Turkish communities, large and small. Other nations, facing similar seismic risk, have opted to invest in technologies to monitor seismic risk more carefully and communicate that risk more systematically throughout the nation. Japan, for example, has invested in an earthquake monitoring system that reports the occurrence of seismic movement electronically to every household to alert residents to danger. California, confronting seismic risk similar to that in Türkiye, has passed a series of changes to building codes over decades that require construction of buildings to standards that will not collapse and kill occupants. Professional engineering associations are now advocating standards for functional recovery of building operations within a reasonable period after an earthquake to hasten recovery for a damaged community. Informed changes implemented over time have demonstrated that it is possible to live with seismic risk. Previous leaders in Türkiye have gambled with recurrent seismic risk that has characterized the country for centuries, betting the odds that the earthquakes would not occur under their authority. Yet, telling evidence from the ruins of once splendid Roman and Greek cities constructed centuries ago belies the continuing danger of shifting tectonic plates in the country. This unfortunate practice is not limited to Turkey. In El Salvador, an earthquake in 1969 damaged the Ruben Dario Building, a five-story building that housed shops and businesses in downtown San Salvador. The building was condemned by structural engineers after the 1969 earthquake, but the owner paid a modest penalty, plastered over the cracks, repainted the walls and resumed business operations. Seventeen years later on October 10, 1986, a moderate Mw = 5.4 earthquake at 11:49 am under the centre of the city brought the entire building down, killing an estimated 200 people who had been working or shopping in the building (Comfort, 1999). For decision-makers who roll the seismic dice, loss is certain at some unknown future time. If the population that recently migrated from the earthquake-damaged region to other areas of the country will share their experience of loss, heartbreak, disruption and pain with their neighbours, the empathy engendered may allow their neighbours to comprehend the need for continuing vigilance in building communities resilient to seismic risk and the possibility of alternative visions of recovery. In sharing their experience, knowledge, insight and pain, those dislocated from the damaged communities can contribute to shaping a common understanding of investment in homes that will not collapse. In Indonesia, the trauma of the 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed an estimated 125,000 Indonesians and claimed more than 100,000 lives in other countries that rim the Indian Ocean, initiated a determined international effort to develop the Indian Ocean Tsunami Mitigation and Warning System. Launched in 2005 after the tragedy, the IOTMWS is operational today, 2023, with 28 member nations, 24 of which are actively engaged in tsunami mitigation and preparedness (Comfort & Rahayu, 2023). As Türkiye copes with the massive losses from the 6 February 2023 earthquakes, the essential task is not simply designing a plan to reconstruct buildings in the short-term, but insistence on the quality of construction and the commitment to long-term sustainability for communities in regions of recurring risk. Such insistence comes foremost from the people who understand the risk and who can envision homes and infrastructure that do not fail. Advanced technologies in recording losses through drone overflights and video cameras provide digital memories that can easily be shared and exchanged. Social media can now facilitate the exchange of ideas and empathy that enable the healing transition from grief to action. The losses endured by this generation in 2023 may then lead to resilience and sustainability for succeeding generations. For example, in the Nepali town of Bhotsipa in Sindhupalchowk District, where homes, schools and workplaces collapsed in the 25 April 2015 earthquake, the townspeople gathered 1 year later on 30 April 2016 to celebrate the opening of a new school for grades 1–8. The school was constructed with funds donated by alumni from a private high school in Kathmandu who wanted to see the children of the village thrive. The pride of the new school was not only a library but a new computer room, with seven desktop computers and an internet connection that would allow children in this remote Himalayan village to interact with other children 10,000 miles away. Similarly, with the collaborative support of their neighbours and the nation, the people dislocated by the earthquakes in the Kahramanmaraş region may begin to return to a safer ‘home’ in a newly imagined and resilient community.

However, with the proliferation of digital technology have come additional ways in which such violence can be committed. As the means and harms of technology-facilitated violence have become more evident, some governments have taken steps to create or empower centralized bodies with statutory mandates as part of an effort to combat it. This chapter argues that these bodies have the potential to meaningfully further a survivor-centered approach to combatting technology-facilitated violence against women and that governments should consider integrating them into a broader holistic response to this conduct. This chapter begins by providing my working definition of technology-facilitated violence against women and argues that meaningfully responding to its significant harms requires a holistic and survivor-centered approach – one that places the experiences, rights, wishes, and needs of survivors at its core. Drawing on existing feminist literature and internationally adopted standards on ""survivor-centered"" approaches to domestic and sexual violence, several foundational elements of a ""survivor-centered"" approach to technology-facilitated violence against women are elucidated: intersectionality, choice, dignity and respect, prevention, and research. The chapter then turns to examining the emerging trend of governments creating or funding centralized bodies with statutory mandates to address technology-facilitated violence. An overview is provided of the operations of New Zealand's Netsafe, the eSafety Commissioner in Australia, Nova Scotia's Cyberscan Unit, and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in Manitoba. These types of centralized bodies have demonstrated an ability to advance survivor-centered approaches to technology-facilitated violence against women through education, research, and direct involvement in resolving instances of violence. However, these bodies are not a panacea. Drawing from their experiences, I outline critiques of their operations and the challenges they face in maximizing their effectiveness. Notwithstanding these challenges and critiques, I conclude by arguing that governments should consider creating such bodies or empowering existing bodies with a statutory mandate as one aspect of a broader response to combatting technology-facilitated violence against women. Some proposed best practices to maximize their effectiveness are identified. The Need for a Survivor-Centered Approach to Technology-Facilitated Violence Against Women This chapter uses ""technology-facilitated violence against women"" to describe a broad range of conduct targeting women, defined as individuals who self-identify as such. 1 This conduct includes cyber harassment or stalking, monitoring or surveillance, image-based abuse (creating, distributing, or threatening to distribute intimate images without consent), impersonation, doxing (publishing private or identifying information online without consent), and deep fakes (digital falsification of images, video, and audio to simulate participation in pornography) (Chesney & Citron, 2019; Wong, 2019; Woodlock, 2017). This type of conduct disproportionately targets and impacts women, among other marginalized groups (Bailey, 2013; Bailey & Mathen, 2019; Powell & Henry, 2019), with women of color, women with precarious status, women with disabilities, women whose first language is not English, and Indigenous women being particularly vulnerable (e.g., Woodlock, 2015). This chapter refers to an individual who commits technology-facilitated violence as a ""perpetrator"" and to the target of that violence as a ""survivor,"" although various other terms are used in the literature, including ""responsible person,"" ""victim,"" and ""victim-survivor."" Technology-facilitated violence can lead to real harms to real women (Powell & Henry, 2017, p. 62), 2 including well-documented harms to their privacy, security, autonomy, and equality interests (e.g., Marganski & Melander, 2018; Powell & Henry, 2017). However, law and society have tended to trivialize technology-facilitated violence as a form of gender-based violence and blame women for bringing this abuse on themselves (e.g., Citron, 2014). This response is arguably linked not just to how we have historically responded to violence against women, but to the belief that harms caused by ""online"" conduct are less serious than those caused by ""offline"" conduct (Powell & Henry, 2017, p. 66; Citron, 2014, p. 102; see also Gosse, this volume). This has led to responses that minimize the former and that tend to place responsibility for mitigating or avoiding those harms on survivors. The serious harms caused by technology-facilitated violence against women, as a form of gender-based violence rooted in misogyny, call for an effective survivor-centered approach to combatting it. ""Survivor-centered"" has been defined as meaning ""that the survivor, not the advocate, guides the intervention, in both what needs are to be met and how to go about meeting them"" (Allen, Larsen, Trotter, & Sullivan, 2013). The concept of survivor-centered approaches (sometimes referred to as ""victim-centered"" or ""survivor-centric"" responses) has been explored in feminist approaches to domestic violence and sexual violence (e.g., Goodman & Epstein, 2008; Nova Scotia Provincial Sexual Violence Prevention Committee, 2019; UN Women Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls, 2011; Spangler & Brandl, 2007). It has also been advocated in the context of post-conflict mechanisms of transitional justice, such as truth commissions and prosecutions (e.g., Soueid, Willhoite, & Sovcik, 2017). In conceptualizing a survivor-centered approach to domestic violence, Goodman and Epstein (2008) emphasize the imperative to honor the differences in domestic violence survivors' particular needs by creating opportunities for them to be heard and to play an active role in shaping the assistance they receive (the principle of ""voice""); to recognize the importance of their relationships and community ties (the principle of ""community""); and, in expanding resources available to them, to focus on those whose socioeconomic status limits their opportunities to be safe (the principle of ""economic empowerment"") (pp. 90 and 135). Survivors and their needs differ based on many factors, including mental and physical well-being; religious, ethnic, and cultural background; immigration status; sexual orientation; embeddedness in social networks; and socio-economic status (Goodman & Epstein, 2008). Important to a survivor-centered approach is ensuring the survivor is able to control the decisions that affect her life (Goodman & Epstein, 2008). The United Nations has also encouraged a survivor-centered approach to violence against women, meaning that all those engaged in related programming should ""prioritize the rights, needs, and wishes of the survivor"" (UN Women Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls, 2011, para 1; see also UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 2016; UN Security Council, 2019). Training materials produced by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (2016) describe ""a survivor-centered approach"" as ""recogniz[ing] the fact that each person is unique, reacts differently to [sexual and gender-based violence] and has different needs"" and as ""promot[ing] respect for the survivors' rights by placing them at the centre of the support system"" (Module 2, p. 16). In the context of health-care provision, survivors' rights enumerated by the UN Women Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls (2011) are the rights to: be treated with dignity and respect instead of being exposed to victim-blaming attitudes; choose the course of action in dealing with the violence instead of being powerless; privacy and confidentiality instead of exposure; non-discrimination instead of discrimination based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation, HIV status, or any other characteristic; and receive comprehensive information to help her make her own decision instead of being told what to do. These principles have also been invoked in the context of providing guidance on the development of survivor-centered sexual violence policies and responses in the context of post-secondary institutions (Nova Scotia Provincial Sexual Violence Prevention Committee, 2019). In the context of transitional justice, Soueid et al. (2017) have described some of the most important components of a survivor-centered approach: gender-sensitive mechanisms that empower women in the society; incorporating cultural sensitivities that allow ethnic, racial, and religious minorities to meaningfully participate; providing social, medical, psychological, and other rehabilitative services; and ensuring access to effective legal representation. Drawing from this context-specific existing feminist literature and guidance, this chapter proposes that there are several foundational aspects of a holistic survivor-centered approach to technology-based violence against women. First, a survivor-centered approach is intersectional. Women are not a monolithic group. Women who also identify as racialized, Indigenous, trans, disabled, and/or immigrant (among other identities) will often experience technology-facilitated violence and its harms in diverse ways. The same holds true for women who live in predominantly English-speaking societies, but who do not speak English, as well as women who live in remote communities (see Woodlock & Harris, this volume). Women who exist at these and other intersections may also face different barriers to accessing information about technology-facilitated violence (see Woodlock & Harris, this volume). Recognizing the diversity of women and the extent to which their needs and experiences are likely to diverge based on social location is necessary to an effective survivor-centered approach. Second, this approach permits and empowers survivors to choose their own course of action in addressing their individual experience of violence. This requires that multiple courses of action be available to survivors to address technology-facilitated violence in the manner in which they deem most appropriate. By way of example, a woman experiencing violence perpetrated by a former partner may want this conduct to stop, but may not want the perpetrator to be criminalized. Having a broad range of options available to a survivor is not only appropriate in light of the unique insight she may have into how the perpetrator might react and what is best for her safety, but it also provides an appropriate way to try to return control of the situation to the survivor. Related to this is the need to ensure survivors are actually informed about these various courses of action so that they may choose the one that is best suited to their own needs and wishes. Third, a survivor-centered approach seeks to ensure that survivors are treated with dignity and respect, rather than blamed for the violence they have experienced. This principle should underlie the development and delivery of both services and information related to technology-facilitated violence against women. Goodman and Epstein (2008) have highlighted the need to better educate communities about ways to assist survivors of domestic violence and to ""reach out to community leaders in religious institutions, health care agencies, educational institutions, workplaces, and other community settings to transform these places into supportive environments"" for survivors (pp. 121 and 123). Fourth, a survivor-centered approach incorporates prevention as a key goal. Reducing instances of technology-facilitated violence, and therefore reducing the number of survivors who need to rely on services and supports to address this conduct, should be prioritized. The burden of prevention should not be placed on survivors; rather, it should be a collective responsibility that encourages a cultural shift in attitudes toward technology-facilitated violence specifically and gender-based violence more generally, including through public education and the education of those who perpetrate this violence or may do so in the future. Fifth, the implementation of a survivor-centered approach is informed by research, evidence, and the perspectives of survivors. Research is crucial to understanding the nature and impacts of recent and emerging forms of technology-facilitated violence against women. Understanding the experiences of survivors who are subjected to this conduct as well as their specific needs must inform the preventative, informational, and remedial aspects of a survivor-centered approach. The Potential of Centralized and Statutorily Empowered Bodies to Advance a Survivor-Centered Approach In recent years, several national and sub-national governments have taken steps to create centralized agencies or entrust a designated organization with a statutory mandate to address various aspects of technology-facilitated violence. This section provides an overview of several of these entities and the ways in which they have demonstrated their potential to further a survivor-centered response to technology-facilitated violence. However, this potential is not limitless. They are susceptible to a number of challenges and critiques, which are also explored. The Proliferation of Centralized and Statutorily Empowered Bodies In New Zealand, the idea to bestow upon an organization a statutory mandate related to technology-facilitated violence was raised in an August 2012 report of its Law Commission, recommending the government adopt a suite of reforms to address harmful digital communications. Among the recommended reforms was to designate an ""approved agency"" to receive and attempt to resolve complaints related to harmful online communications (Law Commission, 2012, p. 110). The impetus for this designation, which the Law Commission (2012) recommended pairing with an independent tribunal, was to enhance access to justice and respond to submissions of key stakeholders that ""New Zealand users need access to a complaints body that is accessible and that has some teeth to negotiate with global entities"" (Law Commission, 2012, pp. 100, 104, and 134). The Law Commission (2012) recognized that ""[m]any complaints will be much better handled by less formal means: by techniques of mediation, negotiation and persuasion"" (p. 128). It also identified education, research, and policy oversight as needed general functions for an ""approved agency"" (Law Commission, 2012, p. 130). The Law Commission (2012) recommended that Netsafe, an independent non-profit organization founded in 1998, be designated the ""approved agency,"" as it was already partly funded by government, performed many of these tasks, and had an established relationship with offshore operations such as Google and Facebook (Law Commission, 2012, p. 130; see also Pacheco & Melhuish, this volume). In late 2013, the New Zealand government introduced what would eventually become the Harmful Digital Communications Act, 2015 (HDCA). The legislation's purposes are to deter, prevent, and mitigate harm caused to individuals by digital communications, and to provide survivors with a quick and efficient means of redress (HDCA, 2015, s. 3). In June 2016, the government appointed Netsafe as the ""approved agency"" under the HDCA (Government of New Zealand, 2016). Netsafe's legislative mandate includes receiving and assessing complaints about harm caused to individuals by digital communications; investigating complaints; using advice, negotiation, mediation, and persuasion (as appropriate) to resolve complaints; establishing and maintaining relationships with domestic and foreign service providers, online content hosts, and agencies (as appropriate) to achieve the HDCA's purposes; and providing education and advice on policies for online safety and conduct on the internet (HDCA, 2015, s. 8(1) (a)–(c), (e)). While New Zealand did not implement the Law Commission's recommendation for an independent tribunal, the HDCA does require that a complaint about a harmful digital communication first be made to Netsafe before an individual applies to the District Court for certain enumerated civil remedies such as a takedown order (HDCA, 2015, ss. 12(1), 18, and 19). Netsafe itself has no authority to order the takedown of harmful communications. Shortly after the HDCA was introduced, the Australian government issued a consultation paper on enhancing online safety for children as part of a September 2013 election commitment to establish a ""Children's e-Safety Commissioner"" (Government of Australia, 2014, p. 5). This proposal was part of a larger commitment to enhance the online safety of children, with a view to ensuring that content and cyber-bullying concerns were handled faster; that children could quickly access assistance with online safety concerns; that criminal laws relating to cyberbullying were appropriate and effective; and that there was clear and expert leadership in online safety (Government of Australia, 2014). Pointing to the New Zealand example, the Australian government recognized ""the need for an accessible and centralized point of contact to deal with online safety"" (Government of Australia, 2014, p. 5). Australia considered following New Zealand's model of designating a non-governmental organization to act as the Commissioner. However, it ultimately established the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner under the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015 in July 2015 as an independent statutory office within the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Office of the eSafety Commissioner [Commissioner], 2015). Notwithstanding the Commissioner's child-focused mandate, in 2016, it launched eSafetyWomen ""to help empower and encourage women to take control of the technology in their lives"" in response to an ""increase in the use of technology to control, stalk and abuse Australian women"" (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2016). The Commissioner's governing legislation was amended in 2017 to re-establish its title as the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 (EOS Act), to rename the Office, and to reflect that the Office's mandate extends beyond the ambit of children (Reichert, 2017). Today, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner is ""the only government agency in the world solely dedicated to the online safety of its citizens"" (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2019, p. 3). The Commissioner's legislative functions include collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating information relating to online safety for Australians; supporting, encouraging, conducting, accrediting, and evaluating educational, promotional, and community awareness programs relevant to online safety for Australians; supporting, encouraging, conducting, and evaluating research about online safety for Australians; publishing reports and papers relating to online safety for Australians; administering a complaints system for cyberbullying against children; and administering a complaints and objections system for the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images (EOS Act, ss. 15(1) (e), (f), (h), (i), 18, and 19A). Around the same time that New Zealand and Australia took action, at the sub-national level, two Canadian provinces created legislative mandates for agencies to address some forms of technology-facilitated violence, including violence that disproportionately impacts women. On April 25, 2013, Nova Scotia's provincial government introduced legislation intended ""to better protect victims and hold cyberbullies accountable for their harmful behaviour"" (Nova Scotia, n.d., p. 1). The Cyber-Safety Act was introduced in the wake of the suicide death of 17-year-old Nova Scotian Rehtaeh Parsons on April 7, 2013, after she was subjected to acts of sexual violence, image-based abuse, and cyber-harassment (CBC News, 2013). The legislation created CyberScan, a unit within the Public Safety Division of the provincial Department of Justice. The unit consisted of a director and investigators whose authority included receiving and investigating complaints about cyberbullying from anyone in the province, attempting to resolve the complaint by agreement or informal action, writing a warning letter to the perpetrator, and filing protection orders (Nova Scotia House of Assembly, 2013, p. 1483; Cyber-Safety Act, 2013, s. 26A–26G). The legislation received Royal Assent just over two weeks later on May 10, 2013. However, on December 10, 2015, the Cyber-Safety Act was struck down in its entirety as an unconstitutional incursion on freedom of expression (the definition of ""cyberbullying"" was ruled to be too broad) and liberty interests (because failure to comply with a protection order under the Act could lead to imprisonment) ( Crouch v. Snell, 2015). In 2017, this legislation was replaced by the Intimate Images and Cyber-Protection Act (IICPA), a purpose of which is to ""provide assistance to Nova Scotians in responding to non-consensual sharing of intimate images and cyber-bullying"" (IICPA, 2017, s. 2(c)). Under the IICPA (2017), CyberScan's narrowed mandate includes providing public information and education regarding harmful online conduct; providing support and assistance to survivors of nonconsensual distribution of intimate images and cyber-bullying, including with respect to the criminal justice system and civil proceedings under the legislation; and providing voluntary dispute-resolution services, including advice, negotiation, mediation, and restorative justice approaches concerning harmful online conduct (IICPA, 2017, ss. 12(1) (a), (c)–(f); Nova Scotia, 2018). Finally, on June 9, 2015, Manitoba's provincial government introduced The Intimate Image Protection Act (IIPA). Regarding the factors motivating the legislation, the Minister of Justice cited the death of Parsons and several other young women in similar circumstances, as well as the desire of survivors for help in getting intimate images removed without always having to go to court (Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, 2015). In January 2016, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P) was designated as the ""authorized agency"" to provide certain services and supports under the legislation to individuals whose intimate images have been or may be shared without their consent (Intimate Image Protection Act Regulation, s. 2). The C3P is ""a national charity dedicated to the personal safety of all children"" and its purposes relate primarily to reducing the sexual abuse and exploitation of children (Canadian Centre for Child Protection [C3P], 2019). To that end, it administers a tip line for reporting child sexual abuse and exploitation of children online, as well as various intervention, prevention, and education services to the Canadian public (C3P, 2019). Advancing a Survivor-Centered Approach to Technology-Facilitated Violence Against Women In and of itself, establishing or recognizing a centralized and statutorily empowered body to address technology-facilitated violence has certain survivor-centered benefits. It signals that the government takes this conduct seriously and condemns it, which can contribute to preventing this conduct and messaging that survivors ought to be treated with dignity and respect, rather than being blamed for it. It can also provide a single entry point for survivors to seek redress, thereby facilitating access to justice and available remedial options, empowering them to pursue the remedy they judge to be best suited to their circumstances. Furthermore, legislative empowerment creates a more permanent authority to address this conduct than a mere funding commitment to a non-government entity, meaning that a change in government is less likely to impact the availability of services and supports to survivors. Broadly categorized, there are at least three additional ways in which centralized bodies with statutory mandates have demonstrated their potential to further a survivor-centered response to technology-facilitated violence against women: direct service-provision to resolve instances of violence; delivering education and information on technology-facilitated violence; and conducting research on the forms and harms of technology-facilitated violence against women. Direct Involvement in Resolving Instances of Technology-Facilitated Violence Particularly in relation to the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images, existing statutorily empowered bodies have been able to provide services related directly to assisting survivors in addressing instances of technology-facilitated violence. Legislative amendments in 2018 empowered Australia's eSafety Commissioner to address image-based abuse, defined as nonconsensual sharing of intimate images or threatening to share intimate images without consent (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2019). It has implemented a ""world-first government-led reporting service for victims of image-based abuse"" through which it received 950 reports in 2018–2019, leading to the removal of material from over 1,700 locations online during that period (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2019). This represented a 90% success rate for removal, notwithstanding most material being hosted overseas (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2019). A civil penalties scheme, which allows the Commissioner's office to issue warnings, infringement notices, removal notices, or fines to those who post or threaten to post the content, as well as the host site, provides significant leverage in targeting and remedying this abuse on behalf of survivors (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2019). The Office has previously attributed its success in part to its close working relationship with social media partners and online platforms to ensure quick removal of material (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2018a). The Commissioner is also mandated to administer a cyberbullying reporting regime for Australian children under 18 years of age, which endows her with powers to take remedial steps similar to those she possesses to address image-based abuse. Although the Commissioner does not have the same enforcement powers to address cyberbullying against adults, she does offer support to assist in attempting to resolve concerns (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, n.d.). In New Zealand, Netsafe provides a free and confidential online service, as well as a helpline, for reporting harmful content, online abuse and bullying, and illegal content (Netsafe, n.d.). Where a report relates to the organization's mandate under the HDCA, Netsafe is empowered to assist in resolving the report, which may include liaising with website hosts, internet service","['potential', 'centralized', 'statutorily', 'empowered', 'bodies', 'advance', 'survivor-centered', 'approach', 'technology-facilitated', 'violence', 'against', 'women']"
An emergency department organizational assessment questionnaire: a Delphi study to create standardized comparators for emergency department directors,2023,"The last 20 years have seen a dramatic increase worldwide in the number of emergency department (ED) visits, and resulted in overcrowding and increased stress in the workplace [1]. The increase in ED visits has also contributed to longer waiting room times and lengths of stay, and has had resulted in worsening morbidity and mortality [2,3]. Some health systems, such as the Swedish National Healthcare Service, have strategized to respond better to the increase in volume. In the Swedish model, triage nurses aided by digital tools act as gatekeepers by limiting admissions through iterative decision-making [4]. It seems necessary; however, to evaluate any new strategy for combatting overcrowding in a reliable and reproducible manner both between hospitals and within a single hospital over time. To our knowledge, there is no current method for comparing how EDs are organized. The organization of an ED can be effective in one hospital and not in another for a variety of reasons (e.g., patient population, disease prevalence, supporting infrastructure, etc.). When assessing the value of a given strategy for making appropriate comparisons, it is, therefore, difficult to limit oneself to a few indicators. Some indicators have been proposed by national regulatory bodies overseeing hospital EDs, but they are ineffective at allowing comparisons both over time and between institutions [5]. Further, these government-proposed indicators have not reached consensus among experts, and hence, do not adequately address the underlying problem [6]. Our objective was to survey a group of experts in the management and organization of EDs to develop a standardized questionnaire to make appropriate comparisons regarding capacity, staffing needs, patient demographics, and other parameters. We conducted a Delphi study in order to obtain consensus among experts about relevant indicators that can affect ED overcrowding. This study was completed in accordance with the accepted Delphi methodology [7]. We selected clinical directors of French EDs as the most appropriate personnel to respond to the survey. These professionals, in addition to their expertise as managers, also represent the diversity of EDs in terms of patient volume, beds per hospital, and whether university-affiliated or not. We carried out four rounds of surveying utilizing the Delphi method. Thirteen experts responded to all four rounds of questioning. More than half of the experts (7/13) had more than 15 years of management experience, four had 10–15 years, one had 5–10 years, and one had less than 5 years. The EDs they managed varied in size with an average of 68 000 patients/year (range 36 000–100 000 patients/year). Forty-nine indicators were proposed by the experts; among them 40 were agreed upon by consensus (Table 1). Table 1 - Indicators with consensus • Average number of ED visits per year • Percentage of patients admitted to an ICU • Percentage of patients over 75 years old • Percentage of patients hospitalized or transferred • Average length of stay in the ED • Average length of stay in a CDU • Number of patients waiting for a bed at 8 a.m. • Average of visits per week • Percentage of patients admitted to the CDU • Percentage of patients left without being seen • Percentage of patients per triage acuity range (1–5) • Filling rate for the monitoring unit • Number of visits during daytime, evening, and overnight • Percentage of patients for each ED area/zone • Specific sectors (resuscitation area, bedded zone, and ambulatory zone, etc.) • Upstream presence of an emergency service call center • Existence of an on-duty general practitioner: on-duty medical center, on-call doctors, urgent care center, availability of nearby emergency departments, public or private systems • ED call center medical advice • Percentage undergoing blood tests • Percentage undergoing radiology imaging studies • Percentage of patients receiving point-of-care testing • Number of establishments accepting transfers • Availability of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transport • Active city-hospital system • Physician shift duration • Number of examination rooms • Number of temporary workers • Number of overtime periods • Organization of rest periods • Working hours • Seasonality of staffing in the ED • Number of practitioners needed versus actual number • Time to nurse triage • Time to nurse evaluation • Time between admission and disposition (admit versus discharge) • Average door-to-physician time • Waiting time for test results (blood tests, imaging studies, etc.) • Time between decision to disposition (admission versus discharge) and effective discharge • Total length of stay • Time for sub-specialty consultation (orthopedics, cardiology, etc.) CDU, clinical decision unit; ED, emergency department; ICU, intensive care unit. Existing tools for the ED director to make objective observations are still limited in their functionality. The indicators we propose offer a tool for evaluating the activity and organization of an ED, allowing comparisons over time and between hospitals. In addition, our questionnaire allows for insights into an ED's staffing needs. Indeed, understaffing is a factor that leads to overcrowding. Other factors are an ED's organizational structure, its level of preparation for unplanned challenges, and its ability to manage disturbances both upstream and downstream, such as availability of primary care, healthcare worker strikes, holidays, and bed capacity [8]. In France, most of the indicators used by regulatory authorities to finance the number of emergency physicians at a given ED are based on population level or on the institution's number of ED visits per year [9]. This assessment often results in a mismatch between perceived needs and actual needs and can result in overcrowding [10]. Other essential external factors exacerbating the problem include nonurgent visits, medical nomadism, epidemics, and shortages of hospital beds [11]. These factors in combination have resulted in overworked caregivers and crowded conditions for ED patients [12,13]. Our questionnaire may assist ED directors in considering daily needs and assessing the potential impact of newly implemented strategies to combat overcrowding. Additionally, these indicators may potentially be used to anticipate hospitalizations and unscheduled care needs and may serve as tools for predicting ED flow [14,15]. In addition to providing organizational value to ED directors and hospital administrators, these indicators may assist in setting expectations for ED providers and patients by being displayed in real-time in the ED and in waiting areas. Patients may potentially rely on data from these indicators to generate more precise estimates of waiting times. Finally, the concept of a reliable list of indicators to guide decision-making to address ED overcrowding could be utilized elsewhere in Europe, in order to better understand the similarities and functioning of EDs throughout the continent and make improvements to their organizational structure. This important topic was discussed in Berlin by the European Society of Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) professional committee and is awaiting publication.

Rethinking global health governance: toward a “global compact” for reducing the burden of respiratory diseases,2022,"One billion people currently suffer from respiratory diseases globally, and most of them are living in developing countries. Respiratory diseases spread negative effects widely to both life expectancy and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the population. The most recent update evidence of the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study report revealed that 454.6 million people worldwide had a chronic respiratory disease, with an increase of 39.8% compared to 1990[1]; the disease has led to 3.97 million deaths in 2019, with an increase of 28.5% since 1990, and accounted for 1035.3 DALYs per 100,000 population (103.5 million total DALYs, with an increase of 20.8% since 1990). The most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (global prevalence: 2.6%) and asthma (global prevalence: 3.4%). More than 10 million people are infected with tuberculosis and 1.4 million people die of it each year, making it the most common lethal infectious disease, just ranked after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.[2] The current pandemic has claimed the lives of >6 million people, primarily due to respiratory causes.[3] Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year and is the leading cancer death.[4] In 2019, respiratory diseases have comprised three of the top ten causes of death according to the World Health Organization (WHO), leading to >8 million annual deaths.[5] Respiratory diseases are one of the main diseases affecting the health of the Chinese population, as well. In 2019, the top five diseases with the highest mortality rate in China were stroke (20.2%), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (16.7%), lung cancer (9.2%), COPD (6.6%), and Alzheimer's disease (4.7%).[6] In 2015, the prevalence of COPD was 8.6%, accounting for 99.9 million Chinese adults >20 years old.[7] The prevalence of COPD among people aged ≥40 years was 13.7%, an increase of 67% compared to the survey results of 2007 (8.2%).[8] Similarly, the prevalence of asthma among Chinese residents aged ≥20 years is 4.2%, with >60 million patients in the country.[9] The pressure of prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases is no doubt overwhelming in the Chinese health sector. The risk factors of respiratory diseases include infection, tobacco smoking or second-hand tobacco smoke, radon, asbestos, or other forms of air pollution. According to the WHO's 2017 report on chronic diseases and environmental risk factors, ambient and household air pollution caused, respectively, 2.8 million and 3.7 million non-communicable disease (NCD) deaths of IHD, stroke, COPD, and lung cancer in 2012. Globally, 29% of COPD deaths were attributable to household air pollution, 8% to ambient pollution, and 11% to workplace pollution.[10] Among the risk factors for asthma, smoking and excessive body mass index are the two most significant ones; while smoking, particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases, and fumes, as well as second-hand smoke attribute high risk to COPD.[11] Climate change acts as a massive direct threat to respiratory health by promoting or aggravating respiratory diseases, and an indirect threat by increasing the population's exposure to known risk factors of respiratory diseases.[12] Changes in meteorological parameters substantially increase respiratory morbidity and mortality in adults with chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, and other serious lung diseases.[13,14] In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the clear indications that a respiratory disease epidemic can threaten us just in a few days. It also reminds us of the best way to pay close attention to the epidemic and effectively control the global spread of the disease. Fortunately, most respiratory diseases are preventable by reducing tobacco use, improving air quality, and implementing new and innovative holistic and integrated approaches to address respiratory diseases and their determinants simultaneously and in coordination. Beijing Call to Action for Lung Health Promotion adopted by the 13th general meeting of GARD in Beijing from 26th to 27th of October 2019 provides a set of solutions for global action.[15] From the COVID-19 crisis comes an opportunity to rethink global health governance, prevention, control, and cure of infectious and chronic respiratory diseases, and promotion of respiratory health must be a top priority in global decision-making and action.[16] Mitigating the Impact of the Environment on Respiratory Diseases. Based on scientific evidence, WHO suggests that there is no threshold of exposure to the particulate matter below which no adverse health effects would be anticipated.[17] Urgent action is needed to realize the commitments to reducing carbon emissions by national governments and international organizations including WHO and other the United Nations (UN) agencies, developmental agencies, foundations, civil society, non-governmental organizations, the private sector including the pharmaceutical industry, and the academic institutions. Placing Respiratory Disease on Global Health Agenda. The 4th UN High-Level meeting is expected to be held in 2025. It must make a political decision to spur actions of addressing the growing burden of chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD and asthma worldwide. Reducing the disease burden should be a leading strategy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and encourage nations to commit.[18] Nations must also reiterate their commitments to place respiratory diseases on the national development agenda. Strengthening Surveillance of Respiratory Diseases and their Risk Factors. Proper planning and implementation of prevention and control strategies depend on reliable and comparable information for monitoring the burden of respiratory diseases and their risk factors; the most critical need in most countries is better information. An appropriate approach should be developed to provide adequate evidence of the respiratory diseases' threats and their risk factors, and continuously track disease incidence, which is often essential for monitoring the achievement of the policy objectives. Promoting Global Action for Prevention and Control of Respiratory Diseases. WHO is acknowledged as the leading agency with the capacity to shape global health policies and research agendas through its strong knowledge base, convening powers, and capacity to identify and disseminate the most cost-effective interventions and best practices. WHO has a constitutional mandate to propose conventions, regulations, and recommendations about international health matters.[19] Therefore, WHO must take action, in collaboration with relative international organizations, development agencies, civil society, non-governmental organizations, the private sector including the pharmaceutical industry, and academic institutions, to develop a global strategy for the prevention and control of respiratory diseases, followed by a global action plan to provide a roadmap for its members to take action. The evidence-based interventions for respiratory diseases must be selected as complementary to the ""best-buys"" included in the WHO's action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs.[20] Shaping Global Respiratory Disease Research Agenda. Prioritizing primary care respiratory research needs have been identified by the International Primary Care Respiratory Group for primary care health professionals worldwide.[21] However, a prioritized research agenda should encapsulate all relevant themes related to respiratory diseases in the context of the global fight against NCDs, infectious respiratory diseases, and the pandemic of COVID-19. This requires both respiratory-disease-targeted interventions and comprehensive NCD programs with an emphasis on health promotion, prevention, and treatment.[22] Furthermore, support from funding agencies is crucial for the implementation of research, that is, for research that explores the most practical and efficient methods of applying knowledge and evidence-based interventions. For example, how can people with COPD and asthma be easily identified at the early stage in primary health care and receive appropriate treatment using mobile digital technologies? How to best guarantee the availability of low-cost generic drugs for people with a high risk of respiratory diseases, particularly COPD and asthma, to ensure their uptake and long-term use without financial impoverishment? What is the long-term impact of climate change on the environment and respiratory diseases? How can the policies and interventions be implemented in high-burden countries? A further research priority is the development of a simple set of indicators for monitoring progress in national implementation.

It has proved indispensable in organisational life and labour, its failures the stuff of enduring legend about the Global Financial Crisis and the excesses of Wall Street. Indeed, the “European Spreadsheet Risk Interest Group” maintains an archive devoted to cataloguing public “horror stories” of legal actions, business failure and government enquiries due to errors in spreadsheet calculations (EuSpRIG Horror Stories). One such tale of spectacular failure occurred in 2012 when a coding error was revealed in a spreadsheet formulae used by economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart to argue for the implementation of harsh austerity measures following the GFC. The spreadsheet purported to demonstrate that when debt levels exceed 90% of the size of GDP then national economies cease to grow, thereby justifying the reduction of public infrastructure and services. To substantiate the argument the data mapped worldwide national levels of debt for the period 1945-2009. However, the authors mistakenly omitted key countries from their spreadsheet – those from the start of the alphabet namely Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark. When these countries were included, the data showed economies can actually grow despite high levels of public spending (Yglesias). As Mike Konczal explains, the “core empirical points providing the intellectual foundation for the global move to austerity in the early 2010s was based on someone accidentally not updating a row formula in Excel”.In this paper I track the history and affect of spreadsheet use across organisational and domestic settings. Expanding upon the insights of Lisa Gitelman, JoAnne Yates and Ben Kafka, who focus on paperwork’s materialities to excavate the labour of bureaucratic media, I report on the early findings of a project exploring the role of the spreadsheet in everyday life. One of the interesting threads I pursue is how the spreadsheet becomes imbricated in the contours and vicissitudes of the home managing and recording its daily practices. Although spreadsheet applications have been extensively studied in business and engineering literatures there has been scant attention paid in the fields of cultural studies, media or, surprisingly, software studies and media archaeology. In the journal Computational Culture where one expects to see finely grained analyses of the algorithms and design decisions underpinning the spreadsheet it has not turned out to be a major concern. This isn’t to say that spreadsheets are omitted from discussions exploring the materiality of digital culture particularly from those interested in institutional life and “evil media” (Fuller and Goffey) but these are often references in passing to broader arguments. As this paper shows, the pervasive nature of spreadsheet use often eclipses its central role in our lives. In order to counter its ubiquity, to make visible its cultural impact, we need to focus on the material conditions from which it emerges and the specificities which shape its use. So I begin with a brief history of the spreadsheet format framed by legal questions of intellectual property and the ways in which these regimes enable its distribution. We then see how it operates to manage risk in relation to personal data management and the Quantified Self both in the organisation and at home. Cutting across these various sites and practices is an interest in how the spreadsheet acts “violently”, how its banality and familiarity belie its ability to generate affective intensities and real material impact. What does it mean to talk of the violence of forms? By this phrase I want to bring to the surface the ways in which forms and other administrative media operate as tools of governance. The spreadsheet in particular extends Yates’s argument in Control through Communication that the history of organisational paperwork is a story of disciplinary systems inaugurated by the circulation of internal documentation. In the early 20th-century workplace, memos, forms, tables, and circulars emerged to produce new hierarchies of managerial control through the downward communication of rules and procedures and the upward flow of reports. Recording and regulating labour, this often overlooked category of communication was instrumental in the move to quantify and monitor people’s activities at work (Yates). With properties of tabulation and calculation the spreadsheet operates discursively, it constrains emotions and bodies in particular ways. Spreadsheet HistoryThe precise beginnings of the spreadsheet program are difficult to pinpoint. Of relevance here is the distinction between spreadsheets on mainframe, timesharing computers of the 1960s to 1970s and the software developed for the Personal Computer (PC) since the 1980s. Is there a direct lineage stretching from the computerised accounting programs designed by Richard Mattessich to the VisiCalc program written by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston in 1979? Reacting to such a chronology, Frankston states that “Mattessich is creating his own myth” elaborating that he “completely misses the point”: I don't begrudge him his work in accounting in the 60's [sic] but it had not the slightest influence on VisiCalc. It was one of many online financial programs. I worked on some systems while at Interactive Data in the 60's and 70's. But VisiCalc was not an accounting program at all, it just made it possible for people to do accounting.This distaste for accounting is echoed by Frankston’s co-creator Dan Bricklin who explains the original name for the program, “Calcu-ledger” was rejected because it carried too many connotations of bookkeeping (Bricklin, Dan Bricklin's Web Site). Instead, VisiCal, short for Visual Calculator, speaks to its genesis in a Harvard lecture theatre where sitting as a student, Bricklin imagined “if only we had a blackboard” on which one “could erase a number and write a new number in, and everything would recalculate” (Bricklin, ""How""). VisiCalc is widely thought to have been the first “killer app” in that it enabled the extensive commercial success of Apple II. Questions of law play a significant role for understanding the history and use of spreadsheet programs. One of the early mainframe based software systems LANPAR (LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random) was unsuccessful in its original application for patent approval when lodged in 1970. Its developers, Rene Pardo and Remy Landau, faced twelve years of appeals before it was granted in a landmark case of 1983 only to be reversed in 1995 (Power). Also billed as the first electronic spreadsheet by its authors, LANPAR invented the “Forward Referencing &amp; Natural Order Recalculation” algorithm. Unlike the earlier programs or some that would follow such as VisiCal, this feature allowed spreadsheet cells to automatically recalculate rather than rely on manual refresh. In other words, the program would use a “topological sort” to calculate values of spreadsheet cells that were dependent on other cells for their totals. During this period LANPAR spreadsheet software was licensed for use by a number of large companies including Bell Canada, AT&amp;T and General Motors (Pardo). Patent law does not generally protect mathematical calculations. Since an algorithm is a set of instructions rather than a tangible invention it doesn’t meet a crucial principle of patent law that protects creations which perform specific functions. As many commentators have noted, software occupies a curious border position: while the code is simply a string a numbers it is also executable, a process that produces or invents. Software is not included within the US patent legislation and case law since the 1960s has seen intense commercial and cultural clashes unfold over what patentability means. Title 35 of the US Code grants patents to: “whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement” (USC 35). The test for patentability requires that the invention must be “novel” and “non obvious”, that is a patent won’t be granted if the product or process is already available to the public nor if its use is obvious to anyone with an “ordinary skill” in the area to which the patent pertains. Rights were exercised for computer software through other measures of intellectual property such as copyright and trademark but in the early days of software development when Pardo and Landau wanted to register their program, code was considered un-patentable. A series of decisions by the US Supreme Court during the 1980s, known as the “Patent-Eligibility Trilogy cases”, established that a software patent claim could not be dismissed “simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer” (Place). These precedents granted their patent for “Process and apparatus for converting a source program into an object program” (Pardo et al.). Sadly, their luck did not hold out. Armed with a newly minted patent, Pardo and Landau instigated an unsuccessful law suit for patent infringement in 1989 against Lotus and Microsoft who had themselves by now developed spreadsheet software. Lotus 123 was created by Mitch Kapor and Jonathan Sachs and released in January 1983 to operate on the IBM PC, its key innovations being the introduction of macros, graphical charts and database capabilities. As the program VisiCalc had achieved with Apple II, Lotus 123 dramatically increased sales of the IBM and is one of the first software programs to run a television advertising campaign (Barker). Lotus overtook spreadsheet sales of VisiCalc who were generating $12m annually, and recorded $53 million in the first year of the program launch, ensuring it dominated the spreadsheet market through the 1980s. Although Microsoft had a spreadsheet program called Multiplan, it was Excel released for Mac in 1985 and for Windows in 1987 that outsold Lotus 123 maintaining market share throughout the 1990s and 2000s (Clarke). Running in the background as a counterpoint to this success is the court battle of Pardo and Landau. In a sense the authors of the LANPAR program were caught up in a broader legal stoush of the time as their patent claim bounced between two opposing statutory bodies who could not agree about the scope of software patentability. Routinely, applications were rejected by the US Patent and Trade Mark Office (USPTO) and then reversed and granted by the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (USCCPA) (Magri and Ellul). At stake for Pardo and Landau was whether they could prove their invention was patentable and further that they met the statutory test for “non-obviousness”. Rejecting their initial patent claim the USPTO found that being an algorithm disqualified it from protection: The courts above us have consistently said that a claim directed in its entirety to an algorithm is nonstatutory. An algorithm is defined ... as a procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem. (In re Pardo)The USPTO then dismissed a subsequent application by Pardo and Landau on the basis that the invention would be obvious to anyone skilled in the area facing the same problem the LANPAR software solved. After years of litigation, the patent was finally granted by the USCCPA who reversed the original rejection citing recent decisions, mentioned above, making algorithms patentable. These matters weren’t in direct contention in the $300 million law suit that Pardo and Landau filed against Lotus and Microsoft. Instead they lost due to inequitable conduct. Unfortunately it was shown these developers had misled the original patent office, failing to disclose their business relationships with witnesses whose testimony they used to argue that Lotus infringed their patent. In losing the case the patent was found unenforceable (Chisum). Debates about the definition and scope of software patents continue apace. Fears about its expansion and the prevalence of non-practicing entities, or “patent trolls” coalesced in the recent US Supreme Court case Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International which considered software patent eligibility, one of the first to do so since the “Patent-Eligibility Trilogies” three decades earlier. Although critics of the decision, denying the patent, argued the judgement should have gone further in guidance on computer patents, many endorsed its continued limits to algorithm patentability (Free Software Foundation). Reading spreadsheet history through these legal frames reveals the complex material, social and economic meshwork (Ingold) in which software applications emerge. I now explore the consumption practices and ecologies of spreadsheet use across organisational and domestic contexts to make visible the ways in which this bureaucratic media plays out in our everyday lives. Spreadsheet Risk in the Organisation Managing risk is a central narrative in contemporary culture for financial markets, commercial organisations and government institutions. Our world seems constantly threatened by ecological, military and informational crises; our personal lives facing pervasive emotional and medical danger (Van Loon). Operating within and often constitutive of these discursive and material fields, the spreadsheet anticipates risk through its algorithmic capacity for modelling and forecasting but it also instantiates that risk with its high propensity for error. This double logic is what gives the spreadsheet its urgency as a unit of analysis through which to understand organisational conditions of labour and regulation. Recognising the crucial social and economic function played by spreadsheets, the European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group (EuSpRIG) formed in 1999 as a collaboration between university researchers, professional associations and industry practitioners in order to “address the ever-increasing problem of spreadsheet integrity” (History). Error detection, regulation and resolution are notoriously difficult to achieve in spreadsheet research. One of the leading reports shows that spreadsheet errors are “pandemic” since 88% of spreadsheets examined contained miscalculations. A study conducted by Coopers and Lybrand revealed that 91% of spreadsheets are in error with a similar figure appearing in the audit run by KMPG (Panko). It is estimated that 1% - 5% of cell formulae contain errors (Gabbay). Spreadsheet risk is difficult to mitigate because of the lack of definition (categories applied vary from typing errors to incorrect cell formula); differences in error detection software used; and disparity in samples (spreadsheets tested in the laboratory as against those operational in the field) (Powell, Baker and Lawson). These inaccuracies have material implications when understood in relation to the prevalence of spreadsheets to fulfil corporate auditing obligations. As Panko argues, 95% of US firms rely on spreadsheets for their financial reporting methods. Spreadsheet error, risk and misuse had a direct impact on the collapse of the global financial system in 2008 (Croll). Spreadsheets rarely operate in isolation. One study reports that only 12% of use in businesses is limited to a single person with 48% routinely sharing with others (Baker et al.). Since few people password protect these documents, cumulative revision is common. In fact, spreadsheet design predominantly occurs in ad hoc ways: an unofficial or beta version then becomes “part of an established business process” (Baker et al.). A vivid illustration is provided by the California Amplifier Company who was found guilty of fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2004. The financial director of the company Barry Kusatzky “hid at least $7.8 million in expenses by fabricating financial statements, falsifying the company's books and records.” The SEC found that his “fraud went undetected because of the company's lack of adequate internal controls” since the financial statements of California Amplifier were “generated from a spreadsheet maintained by Kusatzky on his own desktop computer” kept “wholly separate from the company's accounting system” (SEC). Before Kusatzky, however, there was Enron. Here we see the violence of forms enacted as corporate malfeasance when nearly a quarter of its workforce, some 4,000 people, lost their jobs and life savings in the company’s spectacular collapse. The downfall of Enron, how it became synonymous with corporate corruption, was driven by a byzantine spreadsheet reporting system that gave an inaccurate picture of capital and risk by understating its liabilities and overstating its equity and earnings (Moncarz et al.).What this shows is that the spreadsheet, along with third party applications such as Dropbox and Gmail, form a vast network of shadow IT within organisations. In response to the complexity of financial disclosure and a slew of high profile fraud cases, the Sarbannes-Oxley Act was introduced into US law in 2002 with Section 404 “Management Assessment of Internal Controls” requiring publically listed corporations to reveal their monitoring procedures. Established to implement the Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) sets out standards including how risk is audited, the consistency of financial statements and the controls for independent assessment (PCAOB). Since the law was enacted hundreds of guidelines have been produced to achieve compliance. Providing such guidance, PricewaterhouseCoopers recommends business run an inventory of all spreadsheets to record file name, description, author and the “frequency and extent of changes to the spreadsheet”. Developing robust policies to guard against financial mismanagement is to be applauded. But such recommendations miss a key point about the ways in which grey literature and informal economies operate (Lobato and Thomas). With particular reference to the function of shadow IT systems, organisations may well decry their popularity through terms of use policies but undeniably many rely substantially on this media. In other words, spreadsheet “risk” viewed through the lens of management policies ignores the micro practices in everyday work cultures to which we now turn.Spreadsheets and the Quantified SelfRecent scholarship has pointed to the ways in which self-tracking, personal data management and the “quantified self” reconfigure bio-politics opening up new forms of agency while also widening the reach of surveillance devices (Daly; Jethani; Lupton). Wearable technology, locative media and a rapidly expanding constellation of applications and software – such as Fitbit and Evernote – underpin the auditing and archiving of personal consumption, activity and location. At the same time, burgeoning algorithmic cultures and technologies are also finding valency in the workplace where productivity is increasingly measured and evaluated (Chong; Gregg; McCosker and Milne). Forming a significant node in the media ecology of personal data analytics, the spreadsheet has, again, been somewhat ignored. Yet it plays a crucial role in the governance of self as it regulates and records bodily health and illness. In the final section of this paper I explore the personal and social uses to which the spreadsheet is put for recording and sharing the practices of daily life. Alongside new and emerging applications, the spreadsheet is used extensively by the Quantified Self movement (QS), a community founded by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007 to provide “self knowledge through numbers” (Kelly). Its popularity is in part because so many tracking applications make it easy to export information in a spreadsheet or as a CSV file. Katie McCurdy, for example, identifies the spreadsheet as her favourite self-tracking software explaining how she has been recording her health data for three years in an effort to manage her autoimmune disease. In this spreadsheet she registers symptoms, triggers and medications, making the information available through the website and presentations at the “QS Meet up Groups” (Ramirez). For Greg Kroleski, spreadsheets are a resonant method for representing longitudinal evidence of personal life. Registering his time over a six year period, he tabulates it into eight categories: “Survival, Labor, Spirit, Mind, Expression, Body, Social, Distractions and Transport”, uploading the spreadsheet as a Google doc and requesting comment (Ramirez). And in his book Experience Curating How to Gain Focus, Increase Influence, and Simplify Your Life Joel Zaslofsky is messianic in his praise of spreadsheets to “outsource memory”. As he explains, “everything that you experience from books to blog posts, to conversations to recipes … any experience you have can be curated.” Not only can it be recorded for personal retrieval purposes, the spreadsheet also grows your “curating currency” converting your experiences into “social, financial, spiritual and intellectual capital.” Interestingly, while endorsing the monetisation of “experience curating” Zaslofsky distances himself from the QS movement which he argues demands too much labour in capturing data rather than living life. Instead, his method requires only 0.1% of a person’s time to achieve (Zaslofsky). Discussions such as these are part of extensive narratives about human memory and its socio material support (Barnet; van Dijck) together with wider debates about the institutional processes of digital heritage policy development. These conversations also feed into research about Personal Information Management which examines the software and devices we encounter and must negotiate in our professional and domestic spaces. The lessons of paper, its ‘affordances’ (Sellen and Harper) seem particularly important here as office filing systems expand to incorporate ever increasing stacks of digital and physical data. In one study, modes of caching and retrieval across the “tree structure” of Windows were compared with those deployed as “filing and piling” using cabinets and desks to illuminate the different organisational strategies in play (Trullemans and Beat). The findings point to an increasing reliance on meta systems, such as spreadsheets or proprietary apps like Mendeley, to consolidate and retrieve information stored across a range of geographically dispersed analogue and digital locations. Is a particular book or document to be found at home or in the office? Such results chime with the initial findings from a research project exploring the role that media – social, technical, personal, broadcast—plays in home renovation and building practices. The study, funded by university and industry bodies through the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living aims to map the media ecologies through which people gather information about sustainable modes of renovation and, crucially, how these sites are shared and accessed (Hulse and Podkalicka). While we know something of the way media, in the form of lifestyle and property TV, contributes to the meanings people ascribe to their domestic space (Ouellette and Hay; McElroy; Andrews; Weber), work has not yet drilled down to the material specificities of consumption. In response, this project, with which I am involved, is running a national survey of home renovators to canvas such topics as how media helps to find and engage building practitioners, what media is accessed to plan a renovation; what sites are used to spark inspiration and ideas; and what media is used to document, record and share progress of the renovation project. In this latter category, we have been interested to see how high spreadsheets rank – second only to photographs – as the media of choice for recording renovations. Other methods reported in the survey include sketches, videos and blogs. Although evidence scraped from a variety of renovation forums and websites indicates unsurprisingly that spreadsheets are regularly relied upon for budget purposes in builds and renovations, what is still to be explored and suggestive from our study is how these functions might be complemented by other more novel uses. ConclusionAs a ubiquitous media product, the spreadsheet contours our everyday practices of work and home. It registers our financial dreams, charts our bodily experiences and records the hours we work yet this very ubiquity can often hide it from critical sight. In this paper I have sought to bring to the foreground the many ways that the spreadsheet materially impacts on patterns of digital consumption by exploring its beginnings and historical development and by showing how the program itself functions to model social and economic futures. Particularly in relation to risk management I argued that the spreadsheet operates according to a double logic. While its software makes forecasting and prediction easy it can actually bring about disastrous consequences due to its high incidence of error. Tales abound of “cut and paste” mistakes that enable fraud and deceptive business practices causing widespread financial violence and harm. Yet such incidents must be seen within the context of shadow IT economies used by the very same organisations that would censure others for incorrect spreadsheet usage. If its affective reach is felt across global financial markets, it also figures at the intimate, domestic level as the spreadsheet is used for self-tracking strategies to capture personal data about health and the spaces we inhabit. Stitching together diverse sites of labour and leisure, bureaucracy and home, the spreadsheet has been a vital expression of social and economic life for decades. What then accounts for its relative invisibility in media and cultural studies? Part of the problem is that the spreadsheet, like email, is at once indispensable and reviled, its banality obscuring its significance as an object of study and the irritations it provokes easily dismissed as the inevitable, routine experiences of a bureaucratic life. In this capacity for generating affect and material impacts, however, the incomprehensible form, the annoying “reply all” office email and the impossible to navigate spreadsheet demand attention.

Music as Magic,2023,"Introduction Music scholarship across genres is often concerned with music's metaphysical and ephemeral effects on individuals, communities, and society. These scholarly framings constitute a concept that we refer to here as “the magic of music”. Using this framing, this article addresses the ways that the magic is undermined by a range of worldly, non-magical realities, using the case study of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and their devastating effects on the previously thriving live music industry in Naarm/Melbourne, Australia. The magic of music includes such aspects as the intangible sounds of music, the mysterious practice of creative music-making, and the transformative effects on audiences and others who participate in music culture. We begin with a broad discussion of the sonic properties of music as a form of magic—a common rhetoric that has been used across the world regardless of genre or cultural origin. Next, we turn to the social contexts surrounding music, such as live music settings. De Jong and Lebrun argue that “the power of music” can create “moments of rare, intense and direct interactions between individuals” that are often described as magical, and that “magic is, in this sense, understood as a perfectly natural and plausible, and not supernatural, experience, even if its intensity and rarity in one's life makes it extra-ordinary” (4). We use this framing of “music as magic” in our consideration of the specific context of Australia’s music industry from 2020 to the present. We posit that the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside government-sanctioned lockdowns, cultural shifts such as an increased focus on poor working conditions and risk in music work, and detrimental arts funding policies worked together to effectively break the spell of “music as magic” for industry and patrons. Finally, we draw on key examples from popular music studies, industry reports and new government policies, to call attention to recent proposals to rehabilitate the magic through a re-enchantment of music and the music industry. Feels like Magic: The Social Context of Music Music is a form of organised sound and silence that people across cultures, history, and places, have articulated as possessing magical properties (Nettl). Music is not only sound waves but also a social category, thus the notion of magic extends beyond sound into everyday discourse in the social realm of music, which will be the focus of this article. Audiences/listeners may describe their own response to music as a magical feeling, stemming from the performer’s ability to convey emotion and provide a performance that “mirrors the performer’s [own] deep connection to the music” (Loeffler 19). Such ‘magical moments’ of deep connection among audience members and between audiences and performers may be elicited in various ways. Examples include the sense of emotional self-recognition found via personal lyrics, resonance with unique vocal timbres, or the shared sense of belonging that develops with fellow audience members, including strangers, during musical events (Anderson). For the latter, the magic (or “magick”, a spelling associated with stagecraft) of ritualised music performance is a common element of Paganism in music performance, with some popular music artists implicitly “appropriat[ing] the Pagan subculture's symbols for artistic inspiration and commercial gain”, presenting themselves as contemporary conduits that reconnect audiences to old magics (Sweeney Smith 91; see also Weston). When it comes to these sorts of ideas about magic and music, performers and audiences routinely make claims about magical musical powers such as “talent”, an idea deployed to describe the skills and charisma of certain musicians, and “creativity”, a “magic ingredient” (see McRobbie) that people who write or produce music are supposed to possess in order to perform their craft (Gadir 61–4; Gross and Musgrave 10, 22; see also Nairn). Music of all forms can provide profound affective experiences, regardless of how it is made and who plays it. There is also a magical discourse present in popular music that has reached millions of people in a globalised musical world dominated by recordings. For as long as music has had a mass market, its magic properties (as articulated in multiple ways across history) have been a selling point for musicians, records, and concerts. The recorded music industry’s very selection process is rooted in the idea that “creativity is based on ‘little bits of magic’ and that success is down to luck and timing” (Gross and Musgrave 140). Music writing (scholarly, criticism, journalism) tends to focus on these magical properties: from the sublime nature of a musical work and its form to the phenomenology of sound and affective experience of music, and even the inexplicable, elusive ‘talent’ of particular musicians. Jimi Hendrix labelled his music work “completely, utterly a magic science” (Clarke 195), while Joni Mitchell “consistently referred to Charles Mingus, Wayne Shorter, and Jaco Pastorius as ‘magicians’ and ‘shamans,’ thereby conferring a susceptibility to the miraculous upon the musicians she most respected” (Lloyd 124). As we show below, this conflation of magical and religious concepts is evident elsewhere in discourse on the intangibility of musical talent. Some genres of music have emphasised the idea of music as magic more than others. For example, scholarship on electronic dance music (EDM) has embraced the concept of “DJ as shaman” (Brewster and Broughton 19; Luckman 133; Rietveld “Introduction” 1; Rietveld This Is Our House) and the nightclub as a “pseudo-religious pilgrimage site” (Becker and Woebs 59), extending Benjamin’s argument for art’s origins in service of ritual (24). Miller has further alluded to a mystical DJ craft, both as a performer quoted in music media (Gallagher) and in his own academic writing: “gimme two records and I’ll make you a universe” (DJ Spooky That Subliminal Kid 127; Miller 497). Shamanism is also explored in rock music discourse (see Kennedy 81–90). Notions of musical magic extend beyond performances and personalities into the recording studio. Music mastering is commonly labelled a “dark art” (Hepworth-Sawyer and Golding 241; Hinksman 13; Nardi 211), and the music studio as a site where magic is made (Anthony 43, 194). Rolling Stone magazine has even deployed a recurrent editorial phrase—“the magic that can set you free”—to distinguish the authenticity of rock from pop music (Frith 164–5). We argue that two key ruptures of the last few years—namely, widespread lockdown policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and emerging discussions on poor working conditions and harms in the music industries—have had the effect of breaking the magic spell of music. There has been a groundswell of musicians, commentators, and scholars pausing to query (and in some cases overturn entirely) some of the illusions that the music industry constructs around musicians. We use the city of Naarm/Melbourne in Australia to draw out some of these trends. When the Magic Dies: Breaking the Spell of the Music Industry The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lengthy lockdowns in the city of Naarm/Melbourne. In total, over a two-year period, the city spent 262 days in home confinement under strict orders from the government, with limited travel and no access to the usual amenities of the city, including all public in-person entertainment (Jose). This had a profound effect on the state’s musicians and the music industries that service them. It completely closed the city’s music venues for an extended period, driving musicians into alternative, virtual modes of performance (Vincent) and driving other music workers into non-music-related employment. For a city often touted as “the live music capital of Australia” (see Homan et al.), the lockdowns effectively broke the spell of music as a key employer and as a driver of arts practice and social experience in Melbourne. Quite suddenly, the lockdown periods revealed the precarious lives of musicians away from the stage. Once stripped of the “magical” quality of live performance, musicians’ work and practice appeared both more complex and more routine. The COVID-19 pandemic broke the spell of music that takes place in social settings. At the start of 2020, live music was one of the first activities to be banned. Live music relies on people being near one another, often in enclosed spaces. It often involves people on stage and in the crowd singing, an activity identified early in the pandemic as an effective method of spreading the virus. These attributes, together with its status as “entertainment” rather than as an essential activity, meant that live music gatherings became entirely illegal (Strong and Cannizzo). Even as lockdowns were lifted, live music was one of the last activities to be reinstated, albeit with access restricted in various ways. People continued to engage with music via other means, for example, through virtual live-streamed performances and platform-based audio streaming. Globally, there was an increase in people listening to older, nostalgic music (Yeung)—an indicator that music was still being used for its magical self-soothing capacities, alleviating the worst pandemic anxieties. However, the closure of the Victorian live music sector drew attention to the material conditions of music making in new ways (“Losses Continue”). Many musicians and music workers could not take advantage of government schemes to support workers who had lost their income during the pandemic (Triscari). This highlighted what was already known to music industry workers: that their work was insecure. It also revealed the contradictions within government music policies: on the one hand, music’s utility for city branding, on the other, little regard for what support and resources are required for it to take place. As more and more musicians used the pandemic to draw attention to their already existing labour conditions, the precarious and mundane aspects of music-making became foregrounded in broader discussions (see Strong and Cannizzo). These included the overall degree to which musicians are exploited (see Nairn), whether musicians can earn a living wage, pay their rent, or receive other workplace benefits including safe working environments. These problems exist in stark contrast to the historically mythologised portrayals of musicians as concerned about their art and Dionysian social experience above all else, regardless of their physical or material conditions. In reality, live music work has always included mundane activities and routine labour. The historical mythology of the “star”, regardless of genre, tends to depict the lives of performers as exotic and removed from everyday life. In this sense, performers are perceived as magical as much as the music they make. The everyday world, within this mythology, is something akin to “a fearful, life-threatening condition that could ensnare you in its grasp … as relentless routine and the marker of social distinction” (Highmore 16). Audiences tend to view musicians as committed to alternative ways of being, and music performance as an escape from the everyday, wherein work becomes interchangeable with leisure and touring provides a nomadic lifestyle. However, in recent years, popular music studies research, together with musicians, fans, and media, have called these ideas into question. A career in live music performance appears to offer no escape from responsibility—something at the heart of fearful representations of everyday life. Inside of a music practice, new responsibilities emerge. Leisure becomes labour with all its attendance downsides. Close-knit familial-style relationships are formed, often based on financial and creative partnerships, including the risk of gender-based abuse that exists within such relationships (Fileborn et al.). The nomadic life of a performer involves its own cramped and confining aspects (a life of group transit and service entrances). This combines with an already in-progress push towards making the vicissitudes of this work more visible—afforded by social media, cultural formations such as #MeToo, and a significant upswing in research showing the harms of music work (Gross and Musgrave; Strong and Cannizzo)—to significantly undermine the myth of live music’s magical properties. In Naarm/Melbourne, prior to the pandemic, this myth was brittle. After years of lockdown, it arguably shattered. The emotional devastation wrought by an abrupt and almost complete cessation of live music activities also had flow-on effects on recorded music. For example, it prevented activities such as tours that support album releases, recording sessions, or rehearsing new musical material. Already existing mental health issues in the music industry were highlighted and amplified by these circumstances (Brunt and Nelligan). Together with the aforementioned financial disadvantage experienced by musicians, research had already shown for years before the pandemic that mental health was poor in this sector (Gross and Musgrave). Such mental health issues are due in part to the relationship between music work and conceptions of self and identity, where success or failure are felt as intensely personal (a by-product of the idea that music possesses magical qualities). Mental health problems are also associated with exclusion, bullying and harassment, which are not only widespread but have been normalised and even celebrated for decades. Pre-existing pressures such as these were exacerbated dramatically by the pandemic lockdowns, which spurred on further discussions about them (Strong and Cannizzo). During the pandemic, the magic of music had been disrupted in several ways: the ability of music to connect people to one another in live settings had been curtailed or removed, and the narratives of the creation of music being magical had been replaced with a vision of mundanity, hardship, and underappreciation. If the magic did not set musicians or music workers free, why should they return to long working hours for little pay in an industry that was frequently unsafe and that left them feeling bad—especially when they discovered that when the chips were down, they would be left out of the support offered to others? Re-Enchanting Music: Conjuring a Different Kind of Magic Weber used the term “enchantment” as a means of explaining the magic within worldly (empirical) phenomena. By contrast, he argued that disenchantment was the removal of magical experience from the real world and that this was the result of replacing the “supernatural” exclusively with rationality and calculation (Koshul 9). The easing of lockdown conditions heralded what we call here the “re-enchantment” of the music industry. An industry that is re-enchanted refers to a world which is “susceptible again to redemption” and is “reimbued not only with mystery and wonder but also with order [and] purpose” (Landy and Slalor 2). During the early post-lockdown period, the aim of government, patrons, and the entertainment industry was to rekindle the pre-COVID levels of audience engagement with live music. Audiences themselves were eager to return to live music and were prepared to spend money on concert tickets and music festivals, according to findings from the Australia Council’s Audience Outlook Monitor (Patternmakers). However, this report also showed that restrictions, fears of further outbreaks, and lockdowns were still looming in the minds of audiences and event organisers. This was compounded by a lack of investment in the creative industries broadly by the Australian Federal government during lockdowns and a staggered reopening, particularly in the state of Victoria, where lockdowns continued well into 2021. The road back to ‘normality’ would require putting audiences, industry, and, indeed, the government, back under the spell of music. Reaffirming the idea that music has a fundamental value in society and culture was the first step. The election of a federal Labor government in 2022 started this process, after a decade of conservative Liberal leadership that had actively worked to devalue and defund the arts. The new government quickly launched a consultation process around the arts in Australia, and launched the resulting policy, titled Revive: Australia's Cultural Policy for the Next Five Years, in mid-2023. This policy not only reaffirmed the central place of the arts, including music, in Australia's social life, but went further than any previous government in acknowledging some of the disenchantment in the industry. They committed to establishing Music Australia (Creative Australia) as a body dedicated to ensuring the prominence of music in arts activities, and the Centre for Arts and Entertainment Workplaces, a body that would, among other things, deal with complaints around workplace misconduct of various types. This later body was created partly in response to the Raising Their Voices report documenting widespread bullying and sexual harassment in music spaces. In addition to this, Australian state governments implemented various measures to encourage the re-normalisation of concert attendance. For example, the Victorian State Government’s Always Live funded programme was launched with a regional, one-off gig by the Foo Fighters. Initiatives such as these on the state and federal level served to bolster the struggling industry. An initially slow return to live shows, followed by a spate of visually spectacular, large-scale, sold-out shows by Harry Styles and Taylor Swift, indicate a return to a form of ‘business as usual’ for top-tier international touring artists. Although top-down policy can send a message that music work is valued, much of the ‘magic’ of music is created by communities and within grassroots spaces. In Naarm/Melbourne, the announcement that the iconic live music venue the Tote Hotel was being put up for sale has provided a flashpoint moment. The venue’s current owners have become emblematic of the problems in the industry, reportedly failing to provide proper benefits to their staff over a long period (Marozzi). The owners of the Last Chance Rock and Roll Bar have since announced a fundraiser for three million dollars to buy the Tote, which they have framed in terms of protecting the value of music to the Naarm/Melbourne community. The owners promised to not only protect music-making on the site but also to “leave the Tote to the bands and future generations for the rest of time” by “putting the building into a trust that will legally protect the Tote from being anything other than a Live Music Venue” (“Last Chance to Save the Tote”). References to the (dark) magic of this situation is visible in the designs for the t-shirts given out for contributors to the funding campaign: two zombies crawling from the grave of the Tote, beers in hand, ready to keep on rockin’. The zombies are indicative of a venue risen from the dead through the Naarm/Melbourne music community’s magical effort. The response of the public and commentators that have followed the achievement of this fundraising goal is akin to the wonderment of an audience seeing a magician perform an impressive trick. Notably, the community-led and community-focussed approach of the Tote draws on the magic of connection built around music scenes, not only corporate interests. This includes exploring how venues can be owned by the communities that use them (Wray), schemes that provide artists with a universal basic income (Caust), and “safer spaces” strategies that work to increase the accessibility of music for everyone (Hill et al.). Conclusion In this article, we have outlined the ways that Naarm/Melbourne, which has been celebrated as one of the world’s best live music cities, temporarily lost the magical allure of its musical life in the eyes of many, and subsequently started to regain it through a fragile process of rejuvenation. Traces of ideas about live music’s ineffable magic can clearly be found in recovery stories that now circulate. Moreover, such stories are articulated against a backdrop of new mythologies forming around the city’s music branding and practice. The especially long pandemic lockdown period in Naarm/Melbourne has brought into sharper focus the hard realities of music-making and performance—as labour, local culture, and policy. The post-COVID city is now tasked with selectively rebuilding itself as a music city, unifying the magical potency of the old with a more clear-eyed, unromantic analysis of the present.

Indefinitely beyond Our Reach: The Case for Elevating Audio Description to the Importance of Captions on Australian Television,2017,"IntroductionIn a 2013 press release issued by Blind Citizens Australia, the advocacy group announced they were lodging a human rights complaint against the Australian government and the ABC over the lack of audio description available on the public broadcaster. Audio description is a track of narration included between the lines of dialogue which describes important visual elements of a television show, movie or performance. Audio description is broadly recognised as an essential feature to make television accessible to audiences who are blind or vision impaired (Utray et al.). Indeed, Blind Citizens Australia maintained that audio description was as important as captioning on Australian television:people who are blind have waited too long and are frustrated that audio description on television remains indefinitely beyond our reach. Our Deaf or hearing impaired peers have always seen great commitment from the ABC, but we continue to feel like second class citizens.While audio description as a technology was developed in the 1960s—around the same time as captions (Ellis, “Netflix Closed Captions”)—it is not as widely available on television and access is therefore often considered to be out of reach for this group. As a further comparison, in Australia, while the provision of captions was mandated in the Broadcasting Services Act (BSA) 1992 and television sets had clear Australian standards regarding their capability to display captions, there is no legislation for audio description and no consistency regarding the ability of television sets sold in Australia to display them (Ellis, “Television’s Transition”). While as a technology, audio description is as old as captioning it is not as widely available on television. This is despite the promise of technological advancements to facilitate its availability. For example, Cronin and King predicted that technological change such as the introduction of stereo sound on television would facilitate a more widespread availability of audio description; however, this has not eventuated. Similarly, in the lead up to the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting in Australia, government policy documents predicted a more widespread availability of audio description as a result of increased bandwidth available via digital television (Ellis, “Television’s Transition”). While these predictions paved way for an audio description trial, there has been no amendment to the BSA to mandate its provision.Audio description has been experienced on Australian broadcast television in 2012, but only for a 14-week trial on ABC1. The trial report, and feedback from disability groups, identified several technical impediments and limitations which effected the experience of audio described content during this trial, including: the timing of the trial during a period in which the transition from analogue to digital television was still occurring (creating hardware compatibility issues for some consumers); the limitations of the “ad hoc” approach undertaken by the ABC and manual implementation of audio description; and the need for upgraded digital receivers (ABC “Trial of Audio Description”, 2). While advocacy groups acknowledged the technical complexities involved, the expected stakeholder discussions that were due to be held post-trial, in part to attempt to resolve the issues experienced, were never undertaken. As a result of the lack of subsequent commitments to providing audio description, in 2013 advocacy group Blind Citizens Australia lodged their formal complaints of disability discrimination against the ABC and the Federal Government. Since the 2012 trial on ABC1, the ABC’s catch-up portal iView instigated another audio description trial in 2015. Through the iView trial it was further confirmed that audio description held considerable benefits for people with a vision impairment. They also demonstrated that audio description was technically feasible, with far less ‘technical difficulties’ than the experience of the 2012 broadcast-based trial. Over the 15 month trial on ABC iView 1,305 hours of audio described content was provided and played 158, 277 times across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, the Freeview app and desktop computers (ABC, “ABC iView Audio Description Trial”).Yet despite repeated audio description trials and the lodgement of discrimination complaints, there remains no audio description on Australian broadcast television. Similarly, whereas 55 per cent of DVDs released in Australia have captions, only 25 per cent include an audio description track (Media Access Australia). At the time of writing, the only audio description available on Australian television is on Netflix Australia, a subscription video on demand provider.This article seeks to highlight the importance of television access for people with disability, with a specific focus on the provision of audio description for people with vision impairments. Research consistently shows that despite being a visual medium, people with vision impairments watch television at least once a day (Cronin and King; Ellis, “Netflix Closed Captions”). However, while television access has been a priority for advocates for people who are Deaf and hard of hearing (Downey), audiences advocating audio description are only recently making gains (Ellis, “Netflix Closed Captions”; Ellis and Kent). These gains are frequently attributed to technological change, particularly the digitisation of television and the introduction of subscription video on demand where users access television content online and are not constrained by broadcast schedules. This transformation of how we access television is also considered in the article, again with a focus on the provision–or lack thereof—of audio description.This article also reports findings of research conducted with Australians with disabilities accessing the emerging video on demand environment in 2016. The survey was run online from January to February 2016. Survey respondents included people with disability, their families, and carers, and were sourced through disability organisations and community groups as well as via disability-focused social media. A total of 145 people completed the survey and 12 people participated in follow-up interviews. Insights were gained into both how people with disability are currently using video on demand and their anticipated usage of services. Of note is that most subscription video on demand services (Netflix Australia, Stan, and Presto) had only been introduced in Australia in the year before the survey being carried out, with only Foxtel Play and Quickflix having been in operation for some time prior to that.Finally, the article ends by looking at past and current advocacy in this area, including a discussion on existing—albeit, to date, limited—political will.Access to Television for People with DisabilitiesTelevision can be disabling in different ways for people with impairments, yet several accessibility features exist to translate information. For example, people who are D/deaf or hard of hearing may require captions, while people with vision impairments prefer to make use of audio description (Alper et al.). Similarly, people with mobility and dexterity impairments found the transition to digital broadcasting difficult, particularly with relation to set top box set up (Carmichael et al.). As Joshua Robare has highlighted, even legislation has generally favoured the inclusion of audiences with hearing impairments, while disregarding those with vision impairments. Similarly, much of the literature in this area focuses on the provision of captions—a vital accessibility feature for people who are D/deaf or hard of hearing. Consequently, research into accessibility to television for a diversity of impairments, going beyond hearing impairments, remains deficient.In a study of Australian audiences with disability conducted between September and November 2013—during the final months of the analogue to digital simulcast period of Australian broadcast television—closed captions, clean audio, and large/colour-coded remote control keys emerged as the most desired access features (see Ellis, “Digital Television Flexibility”). Audio description barely registered in the top five. In a different study conducted two years ago/later, when disabled Australian audiences of video on demand were asked the same question, captions continued to dominate at 63.4 per cent; however, audio description was also seen to be a necessary feature for almost one third of respondents (see Ellis et al., Accessing Subcription Video).Robert Kingett, founder of the Accessible Netflix Project, participated in our research and told us in an interview that video on demand providers treat accessibility as an “afterthought”, particularly for blind people whom most don’t think of as watching television. Yet research dating back to the 1990s shows almost 100 per cent of people with vision impairments watch television at least once a day (Cronin &amp; King). Statistically, the number of Australians who identify as blind or vision impaired is not insignificant. Vision Australia estimates that over 357,000 Australians have a vision impairment, while one in five Australians have a disability of some form. With an ageing population, this number is expected to grow exponentially in the next ten years (Australian Network on Disability). Kingett therefore describes this lack of accessibility as evidence video on demand is “stuck in the dark ages”, and advocates that people with vision impairments do use video on demand and therefore continue to have unmet access needs.Video on Demand—Transforming TelevisionSubscription video on demand services have caused a major shift in the way television is used and consumed in Australia. Prior to 2015, there was a small subscription video on demand industry in this country. However, in 2015, following the launch of Netflix Australia, Stan, and Presto, Australia was described as having entered the “streaming wars” (Tucker) where consumers would benefit from the increased competition. As Netflix gained dominance in the video on demand market internationally, people with disability began to recognise the potential this service could have in transforming their access to television.For example, the growing availability of video on demand services continues to provide disruptive change to the way in which consumers enjoy information and entertainment. While traditional broadcast television has provided great opportunities for participation in news, events, and popular culture, both socially and in the workplace, the move towards video on demand services has seen a notable decline in traditional television viewing habits, with online continuing to increase at the expense of Australian free-to-air programming (C-Scott).For the general population, this always-on, always-available, and always-shareable nature of video on demand means that the experience is both convenient and instant. If a television show is of interest to friends and family, it can be quickly shared through popular social media with others, allowing everyone to join in the experience. For people with disability, the ability to both share and personalise the experience of television is critical to the popularity of video on demand services for this group. This gives them not only the same benefits as others but also ensures that people with disability are not unintentionally excluded from participation—it allows people with disability the choice as to whether or not to join in. However, exclusion from video on demand is a significant concern for people with disability due to the lack of accessibility features in popular subscription services. The lack of captions, audio description, and interfaces that do not comply with international Web accessibility standards are resulting in many people with disability being unable to fully participate in the preferred viewing platforms of family and friends.The impact of this expands beyond the consumption patterns of audiences, shifting the way the audience is defined and conceptualised. With an increasing distribution of audience attention to multiple channels, products, and services, the ability to, and strategies for, acquiring a large audience has changed (Napoli). As audience attention is distributed, it is broken up, into smaller, fragmented groups. The success, therefore, of a new provider may be to amass a large audience through the aggregation of smaller, niche audiences. This theory has significance for consumers who require audio description because they represent a viable target group. In this context, accessibility is reframed as a commercial opportunity rather than a cost (Ellis, “Netflix Closed Captions”).However, what this means for future provision of audio description in Australia is still unclear. Chris Mikul from Media Access Australia, author of Access on Demand, was interviewed as part of this research. He told us that the complete lack of audio description on local video on demand services can be attributed to the lack of Australian legislation requiring it. In an interview as part of this research he explained the central issue with audio description in this country as “the lack of audio description on broadcast TV, which is shocking in a world context”.International providers fare only slightly better. Robert Kingett established the Accessible Netflix Project in 2013 with the stated aim of advocating for the provision of audio description on Netflix. Netflix, despite a lack of a clear accessibility policy, are seen as being in front in terms of overall accessibility—captions are available for most content. However, the provision of audio description was initially not considered to be of such importance, and Netflix were initially against the idea, citing technical difficulties. Nevertheless, in 2015—shortly after their Australian launch—they did eventually introduce audio description on original programming, describing the access feature as an option customers could choose, “just like choosing the soundtrack in a different language” (Wright). However, despite such successful trials, the issue in the Australian market remains the absence of legislation mandating the provision of audio description in Australia and the other video on demand providers have not introduced audio description to compete with Netflix. As the Netflix example illustrates, both legislation and recognition of people with disability as a key audience demographic will result in a more accessible television environment for this group.Currently, it is debatable as to whether this increasingly competitive market, the shifting perception of audience attraction and retention, and the entry of multiple international video on demand providers, has influenced how accessibility is viewed, both for broadcast television and video on demand. Although there is some evidence for an increasing consideration of people with disability as “valid” consumers—take, for example, the iView audio description trial, or the inclusion of audio description by Netflix—our research indicates accessibility is still inconsistently considered, designed for, and applied by current providers.Survey Response: Key Issues Regarding AccessibilityRespondents were asked to provide an overall impression of video on demand services, and to tell us about their positive and negative experiences. Analysis of 68 extended responses, and the responses provided by the interview participants, identified a lack of availability of accessibility features such as audio description as a key problem. What our results indicate is that while customers with a disability are largely accommodating of the inaccessibility of providers—they use their own assistive technology to access content—they are keenly aware of the provisions that could be made. As one respondent put it:they could do a lot better: talking menus, spoken sub titles, and also spoken messages on screen.However, many expressed low expectations due to the continued absence of audio description on broadcast television:so, the other thing is, my expectations are quite low because of years of not having audio descriptions. I have slightly different expectations to other people.This reflection is important in considering both the shifting expectations regarding video on demand providers but also the need for a clear communication of what features are available so that providers can cater to—and therefore capture—niche markets.The survey identified captioning as the main accessibility problem of video on demand services. However, this may not accurately reflect the need for other accessibility features such as audio description. Rather, it may be indicative that this feature is often the only choice given to consumers. As, Chris Mikul identified, “the only disability being catered for to any great extent is deafness/hearing impairment”. Kingett agreed, noting:people who are deaf and hard of hearing are placed way before the rest because captions are beyond easy and cheap to create now. Please, there’s even companies that people use to crowd source captions so companies don’t have to do it anymore. This all came about because the deaf community has [banded] together … to achieve a cause. I know audio description isn’t as cheap to make as captions but, by these companies’ budgets that’s like dropping a penny.Advocacy and Political WillAs noted above, it has been argued by some that accessibility features that address vision impairments have been neglected. The reason behind this is twofold—the perception that this disability is experienced by a minority of the population and that, because blind people “don’t watch television”, it is not an important accessibility feature. This points towards a need for both disability advocacy and political will by politicians to introduce legislation. As one survey respondent identified, the reality is that, in Australia, neither politicians nor people with vision impairments have yet to address the issue on audio description in an organised or sustained way:we have very little audio described content available in Australia. We don’t have the population of blind people nor the political will by politicians to force providers to provide for us.However, Blind Citizens Australia—the coalition of television audiences with vision impairments who lodged the human rights complaint against the government and the ABC—suggest the tide is turning. Whereas advocates for people with vision impairments have traditionally focused on access to the workforce, the issue of television accessibility is increasingly gaining attention, particularly as a result of international activist efforts and the move towards video on demand (see Ellis and Kent).For example, Kingett’s Accessible Netflix Project in the US is considered one of the most successful accessibility movements towards the introduction of audio description. While its members are predominantly US-based, it does include several Australian members and continues to cover Netflix Australia’s stance on audio description, and be covered by Australian media and organisations (including Media Access Australia and Life Hacker). When Netflix launched in Australia, Kingett encouraged Australians to become more involved in the project (Ellis and Kent).However, despite the progress towards mandating of audio description in parliament and the resolution of efforts made by advocacy groups (including Vision Australia and Blind Citizens Australia), the status of audio description remains uncertain. Whilst some support has been gained—specifically through motions made by Senator Siewert and the ABC iView audio description trials—significant change has been slow. For example, conciliation discussions are still ongoing regarding the now four-year-old complaint brought against the ABC and the Federal Government by Blind Citizens Australia. Meanwhile, although the Senate supported Senator Siewert’s motion to change the Broadcasting Services Act to include audio description, the Act has yet to be amended.The results of multiple ABC trials of audio description remain in discussion. Whilst the recently released report on the findings of the April 2015—July 2016 iView trial states that the “trial has identified that those who utilised the audio description service found it a valuable enhancement to their media engagement and their social interactions” (ABC, “ABC iView Audio Description Trial” 18), it also cautioned that “any move to introduce AD services in Australia would have budgetary implications for the broadcasters in a constrained financial environment” and “broader legislative implications” (ABC, “ABC iView Audio Description Trial” 18). Indeed, although the trial was considered “successful”—in that experiences by users were generally positive and the benefits considerable (Media Access Australia, “New Report”)—the continuation of audio description on iView alone was clarified as representing “a systemic failure to provide people who are blind or have low vision with basic access to television now, given that iView is out of reach for many people in the blindness and low vision community” (Media Access Australia, “New Report”). Indeed, the relatively low numbers of plays of audio described content during the trial (158, 277 plays, representing 0.58% of total program plays on iView) were likely a result of a lack of access to smartphones or Internet technology, prohibitive data speeds and/or general Internet costs, all factors which affect the accessibility of video on demand significantly more for people with disability (Ellis et al., “Access for Everyone?”).On a more positive note, the culmination of advocacy pressure, the ABC iView trial, political attention, and increasing academic literature on the accessibility of Australian media has resulted in the establishment of an Audio Description Working Group by the government. This group consists of industry representatives, advocacy group representatives, academics, and “consumer representatives”. The aims of the group are to: identify options to sustainably increase access to audio description services; identify any impediments to the implementation of audio description; provide expert advice on audio description implementation options; and develop a report on the findings due at the end of 2017.ConclusionIn the absence of audio description, people who are blind or vision impaired report a less satisfying television experience (Cronin and King; Kingett). However, with each technological advancement in the delivery of television, from stereo sound to digital television, this group has held hopes for a more accessible experience. The reality, however, has been a continued lack of audio description, particularly in broadcast television.Several commentators have compared the provision of audio description with closed captioning. They find that audio description is not as widely available, and reflect this is likely a result of lack of legislation (Robare; Ellis, “Digital Television Flexibility”)—for example, in the Australian context, whereas the provision of captions is mandated in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, audio description is not. As a result, there have been limited trials of audio description in this country and inconsistent standards in how to display it. As discussed throughout this paper, people with vision impairments and their allies therefore often draw on the example of the widespread “acceptance” of captions to make the case that audio description should also be more widely available.However, following the introduction of subscription video on demand in Australia, and particularly Netflix, the issue of audio description is receiving greater attention. It has been argued that video on demand has transformed television, particularly the ways in which television is accessed. Video on demand could also potentially transform the way we think about accessibility for audiences with disability. While captions are a well-established accessibility feature facilitating television access for people with a range of disabilities, video on demand is raising the profile of the importance of audio description for audiences with vision impairments.ReferencesABC. “Audio Description Trial on ABC Television: Report to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy”.

Public policy and operations management,2021,"Public policies are ""deliberate decisions by governments or equivalent authorities to take action or nonaction toward specific objectives"" (Weible & Carter, 2017, p. 24). Challenges in public policy are inherently ""wicked"" (Rittel & Webber, 1973), since they are complex, interconnected, difficult to define, involve many stakeholders, and can typically be addressed only through trial and error (Birkland, 2019; Dye, 2017; Weible & Sabatier, 2018). Furthermore, achieving public-policy goals (e.g., infrastructure, education, healthcare, social welfare) requires spanning many boundaries (Kettl, 2006). We urge operations management (OM) scholars to aid in addressing this wickedness by becoming more active contributors to the public-policy dialogue. OM is defined by Hill (2011) as the ""management of the transformation process that converts labor, capital, materials, information, and other inputs into products and services for customers"" (p. 242) or, more broadly by Browning (2020), as ""managing work to produce valuable results"" (p. 497), specifically including work across supply chains and networks. In this editorial, we argue that the OM discipline is particularly well placed to make significant managerial and theoretical contributions to public policy, as has been argued recently by others (Anderson et al., 2020; Joglekar et al., 2016; Kaplan, 2021; Tokar & Swink, 2019). In spite of these arguments, OM scholars rarely place public-policy considerations at the center of their work.11 Exemplifying the lack of focus of OM to public policy, the author guidelines of this journal have historically stated: ""Focus on decisions pertinent to operations managers…"" A concrete outcome of the creation of the Public Policy Department and the writing of this editorial was an update to these guidelines to explicitly include OM-related decisions pertinent to public-policy makers, as well. We see three main ways in which OM researchers can contribute to better public policy: (1) uncovering the impact of public policy on the operations and supply chains of organizations outside of the public sector, (2) using this understanding to make specific recommendations for public policy, and (3) evaluating the structure and management of the operations of agencies who make and implement public policy. The Public Policy Department at the Journal of Operations Management (JOM) encourages contributions on any of these. We believe that an increased focus on public policy and its implications will increase the impact of OM research on society. In Section 2, we provide a brief review of the public-policy literature, including a discussion of the complexities of public policy as well as some common misconceptions. In Section 3, we review the historical relationship between OM and public policy. In Section 4, we discuss some already-significant contributions that OM research has made to public policy and in Section 5 highlight some challenges and provide specific recommendations to authors. In Section 6, we conclude. In addition to spurring more and better OM work that influences public policy, we also hope that this editorial encourages public-policy scholars to publish their OM-related work in JOM. In this section, we briefly discuss public-policy scholars' analyses of how public policy22 Note that we have been careful to refer to the main subject of this editorial as ""public policy"" as opposed to just ""policy,"" except in cases where the term is repeated frequently. This is to avoid confusion with common OM uses of the term policy that refer to an entity's operations with no direct public-policy aspect, such as inventory or ordering policy, or company policies related to employee behavior or pay, or even the more general term ""business policy."" We suggest authors follow our convention when stating relationships between their research and public policy. is made, in both the ideal and the real worlds. Our primary goal is to aid OM researchers wishing to contribute to public policy. Beyond this, we believe that exposure to the public-policy literature can be beneficial to OM scholars not studying policy. For example, theoretical frameworks related to the processes and power struggles involved in shaping policy may be useful to OM scholars studying the effects of powerful interests on shaping institutional, organizational, and inter-organizational processes. An exact definition of public policy has proven to be elusive (Birkland, 2019). In general terms, public policy refers to actions (and nonactions)33 The term ""public policy"" is often used to refer to both the process and the outcomes of government actions (and nonactions). For clarity, it is perhaps best to distinguish between public policy (outcomes) and the public-policy process. In this paper, we use ""public-policy process"" when explicitly focusing on the process of developing policy and ""public policy"" to refer to not only the outcomes of public policy but also when we are discussing public policy broadly. of governmental actors (Birkland, 2019; Dye, 2017; Weible & Sabatier, 2018). Below, we describe the abstract model or, as described by Weber (Weber et al., 1949), the ideal-typical44 ""The ideal type is an abstract model created by Max Weber that, when used as a standard of comparison, enables us to see aspects of the real world in a clearer, more systematic way. It is a constructed ideal used to approximate reality by selecting and accentuating certain elements"" https://www.thoughtco.com/ideal-type-definition-3026354 vision of the goals of public policy, then we introduce some real-world complications. In the ideal-typical vision, the key goal of public policy is to maximize social welfare (Brooks & Manza, 2006). In capitalist societies like the United States in recent decades, a means of achieving this goal is to address market failures (i.e., situations where the private sector fails to achieve something that society values). Examples of goals requiring public-policy intervention to maximize social welfare include a healthy natural environment, an educated society, property protection, safe and inclusive workplaces, business practices that align with society's priorities and ideals, and care for those unable to care for themselves. To attempt to remedy market failures and improve social welfare, government authorities create public policies, such as laws and regulations, intended to (dis)incentivize certain behaviors (Dye, 2017). The public-policy process is comprised of administrative, policy, and political dynamics (Shipman, 1959). In OM, a process is defined as ""a set of steps designed to achieve a particular goal"" (Hill, 2011, p. 270); at least in traditional OM research the term ""process"" typically refers to such things as documented steps in a manufacturing line or a standard operating procedure. OM has, however, increasingly used the term ""process"" to refer to much broader sets of activities such as product development, the management and definition of connections between the operations of different organizations (such as suppliers and customers), and strategy development and deployment. Still, the term usually refers to a formal, even if not yet documented, set of steps to be taken. In public policy, the term ""process"" has been long been understood very broadly, including progressions whose steps and protagonists are not defined in advance, but emerge along the way, as often happens in the ""public-policy cycle."" The public-policy cycle framework (Lasswell, 1956), often also referred to as the public-policy stage framework, is the most common description of the public-policy process. While this framework has been criticized for its lack of explanatory power, limited theoretical relevance, and oversimplification of a complex and dynamic process (Nakamura, 1987), it is a helpful starting point. According to the framework, the public-policy process is constructed around several main stages: (1) problem identification/agenda setting, (2) design/formulation,55 The process of identifying and evaluating policy options is often referred to as policy analysis. (3) decision-making/budgeting, (4) implementation, and (5) evaluation/termination.66 While this description is largely US/Western-centric, by adjusting for political values and structures (e.g., imposing constraints)—the model can be easily adopted and extended to non-US/Western contexts (Peters & Zhao, 2017). OM scholars may recognize similarities between this and the well-known PDCA (plan-do-check-act)77 The PDCA cycle is identified as originating with Dr. W. Edwards Deming's 1950s lecture in Japan (Pietrzak & Paliszkiewicz, 2015) approach to process improvement. During the first stage, a problem is identified either by members of the government or public-policy entrepreneurs.88 These are lobbyists, social activists, or philanthropists who pursue certain public policies (driven by either altruism or self-interest). If deemed sufficiently significant to warrant attention, the problem is placed on the agenda for public policymakers to address. In the second stage, solutions are identified and designed. Decisions about how the solutions will be adopted and financed are made during the third stage. In the fourth stage, the approach is implemented at the chosen level (e.g., in the US: local, state, or federal); implementation includes interpretation of the policy by those charged with carrying it out. In the last stage, the policy is evaluated for purposes of continuous improvement and/or termination. This framework implicitly assumes a sequential approach to decision-making. In the real world, stages overlap, are repeated, or are skipped. In the public-policy literature, each stage represents an entire research domain, each with its own theoretical and methodological preferences. As a whole, then, the study of public policy entails the study of the actors (e.g., attributes, interests), the dynamics (e.g., interactions, resource allocations), the outcomes (e.g., design, effectiveness), and the implications (e.g., social change) of the public-policy process(es) (Ostrom, 1990, 2005; Weible & Sabatier, 2018).99 By another classification, core public-policy research can be classified as falling within three broad categories: (1) public-policy process (i.e., how public policy is made), (2) public-policy analysis (i.e., what public policy should look like and how it works), and (3) the power dynamics of the political influences (Birkland, 2019). In its ideal form, public policy would be driven by objective, databased considerations in which resources are allocated based on their greatest positive impact on social welfare. In reality, public policy regularly deviates from this ideal (Bentley, 1975; Dye, 2017; Weible & Sabatier, 2018). The definition of social welfare itself, of course, will vary by political parties, politicians, policymakers, and individuals. Even if agreement on the definition of social welfare existed, policies necessarily reflect compromises between competing goals (e.g., democracy vs. efficiency) (Waldo, 1948). Public-policy scholars investigate the implications of these deviations from ideal processes in the making of public policy.1010 This is analogous to behavioral OM, a branch of OM which investigates how and why the behavior and decision making of operations managers deviates from that predicted or prescribed by optimal models. JOM has been instrumental in the development of this sub-field (e.g., Bendoly et al. (2006); Croson et al. (2013)). A key difference is that public policy has few, if any, mathematical optimization models to compare actual decisions to a theoretical optimal. (Thanks to Travis Tokar for this observation). An OM scholar may wonder, for example, why negotiations over legislation do not come to fruition, or why realized policy differs from stated narratives. It is often the case that, for example, the actual (publicly unstated) goals of public policy may not be the ones used to manage public narratives (targeted at generating support) (Dye, 2017; Stone, 2012). Some public policy may be merely symbolic in nature, having little to do with solving actual policy problems (Gustafsson, 1983). Sometimes policy actors seek to define or create a policy problem to fit a pre-existing solution1111 Most often, a ""solution"" of interest to public-policy entrepreneurs—for example, some have argued that participants in the ""military/industrial complex"" continually seek new threats to justify the investments in military capability that may not be needed (Marsella, 2011; Pilisuk & Rountree, 2008). (Cohen et al., 1972; Kingdon, 2011; Miller & Fox, 2007; Zahariadis, 2003). Taken together, public policy and the public-policy process may be perceived more than a struggle over enforcement of values and (re)distribution of resources (i.e., power) than as an authentic effort to maximize the welfare of a broad public (Gilens & Page, 2014; Lasswell, 1936; Mills, 1956; Stone, 2012). OM scholars critically evaluating existing policy should be aware of these challenges when articulating recommendations. Further, public policy may be implemented differently in practice than it was envisioned (Lipsky, 2010; Pressman & Wildavsky, 1973). Specifically, the translation of the public-policy content of laws and regulations into actual implementation depends upon some less obvious actions such as institutional decision-making (Ostrom, 2005) or decision-making by street-level bureaucrats (i.e., workers with direct contact with the public such as police officers, teachers, social workers, etc.) (Lipsky, 2010; May & Winter, 2009). As a simple example, state laws in the US create speed limits on highways as an outcome of a public-policy process, but those who enforce this typically ignore small violations, making the actual speed driven on most highways several miles per hour faster than the posted limits. OM scholars are familiar with settings in which compliance with requirements does not always occur (such as hand washing in hospitals, e.g., Staats et al., 2017) and have studied ways to improve compliance (such as inspection regimes to monitor compliance with regulations, e.g., Ball et al., 2017). As such, OM scholars are well-equipped to consider ways to improve compliance with public policies. Public-policy scholars also note that the absence of activity in the public-policy process within a specific domain should not be equated with a lack of a need for public-policy intervention. Sometimes powerful interests have not allowed particular issues to be defined as problems and placed on the public-policy agenda (Gilens & Page, 2014; Lukes, 2005). Stated concisely, lack of public-policy action is sometimes a public-policy decision in itself. For example, in the US there is currently no specific federal privacy statute governing the use of commercially available personal information. This does not mean that the use of individual data provided by commercial databases is not an issue—as exemplified by the growing efforts to place it on the agenda and the laws passed by the European Union and US states such as California (National Conference of State Legislatures [NCSL], 2020); it may mean that for decades powerful interests were successful in keeping it off the public-policy agendas (Cate, 2008). If researching an area with no apparent public policy, OM scholars should be aware of the above. The public-policy literature also dispels the misconception that private firms prefer less government action. In fact, firms (in particular, large ones) are active and important players in the drive for, and the design of, public policy in areas such as standardization, intellectual-property protection, and government investments (Kerwin & Furlong, 2010; Leone, 1986; Richter et al., 2009). Government investments include public policies aimed at improving overall public education, health, public safety, and infrastructure. Even seemingly burdensome regulations are sometimes supported by private entities, such as large firms or established players, as these regulations can serve as potential barriers to market entry (Dean & Brown, 1995). OM researchers should be aware of these dynamics when evaluating, or suggesting, policy solutions. It is also a misconception that government is always bureaucratic and uncreative. In fact, government action can create new opportunities for private-sector firms, with sometimes dramatic effects on how firms operate for competitive advantage. That is, ""the state has not just fixed markets, but actively created them"" (Mazzucato, 2011). To take just one example, the US government was indispensable in the creation of the internet; the first working version of a computer network was built inside the Defense Department, and the larger network did not take off until the National Science Foundation took over the operation of the Internet using open standards it had developed (Abbate, 2001).1212 For other examples, see Breznitz, 2007; Amsden, 1992. These features of how the government (and other macro forces) change the firm's environment are important for OM scholars to understand. Often, OM scholars look only within the organization1313 Or, as exemplified by the Inter-Organizational Relationships Department at JOM, between private-sector organizations, such as buyers and suppliers. for causes and effects, missing the ways that public policy can change the technologies available to firms or affect the demand for and supply of labor (through war, training, etc.). OM scholars should also note that many of these properties of public policy might well apply in the private sector—implying that the public-policy literature can inform OM research on, for example, internal decision-making and change implementation. For example, Bidwell (2012) explicitly studied how internal organizational politics affect a firm's make-buy decisions—something that has been picked up by relatively few scholars in operations and supply chain (exceptions include Stanczyk et al., 2015; Franke & Foerstl, 2020). More broadly, akin to the public-policy process not following a linear path, in the private sector Mintzberg (1978, 1989) argued that management strategy often emerges in a way that means it rarely operates as originally intended. For example, powerful managers may block action if it would threaten their position, even if the action would improve the firm's performance. Conversely, some of these features of public policy provide opportunities for scholars to apply OM tools to new problems. For example, OM scholars have applied process analysis (e.g., value-stream mapping) to relatively ill-defined processes such as R&D or extended supply chains. These tools could be used to analyze and/or improve the public-policy process by explicitly looking at the steps a process actually followed, the inputs to the process, where bottlenecks arise, etc.1414 Attesting to this, in discussing how to deal with cases of blood clotting after COVID-19 vaccine administrations, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb noted in The Wall Street Journal: ""We need a thorough, predictable process to assess emerging data on vaccines and advise doctors on their benefits and risks."" (https://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-safety-is-fdas-job-not-cdcs-11618780270?page=1 WSJ April 18, 2021; accessed April 21, 2021) Experience with ramp-up and scale-up of private-sector products and services can help with the public-sector implementations to the broad population. Examples range from the rollout of government websites to the scale-up of successful randomized, controlled trials. Indeed, the challenges created by implementing public policy on a large scale have led to fields such as ""policy implementation research"" (Lipsky, 2010; Pressman & Wildavsky, 1973; Saetren, 2005) and ""implementation science"" (Lavis et al., 2004; Nilsen et al., 2013). ""Both fields depict potentially damaging gaps between the expectations of the policy makers and the actual impact of the policy and between what research has shown to be effective and what is actually practiced in routine"" (Nilsen et al., 2013, p. 4)—gaps to which OM scholars can surely contribute. In Table 1, we list frameworks and theories from the public-policy literature, along with seminal citations. As already noted, beyond simply being aware of these when trying to make a public-policy contribution, we also believe that there is opportunity for OM scholars to employ these theories and frameworks to better understand the operations of private firms and their supply chains.1515 We note that there are organizational theories that may lie between OM and public policy, such as North's (1990) institutional theory and Pfeffer and Salancik's (1978) resource dependence theory. Thanks to Martin Spring for this point. There are easily identifiable examples of public policies that have large and lasting effects on OM practices. The deregulation of industries such as airlines, rail, and motor carriers not only created competition but also dramatically changed the strategies and practices of logistics operators. For example, Smith and Grimm (1987) found that after railroad deregulation firms tended to change from an ""unfocused"" strategy (one in which a specific strategic dimension is not emphasized) to a ""focused"" strategy (one which emphasizes a strategic dimension such as low cost or emphasis on innovation). Corsi and Stowers (1991) argued that deregulation meant that the motor carrier industry needed to ""be innovative in their management approaches toward cost control and operating philosophies or risk bankruptcy"" (p. 26); they found that the most frequent way of controlling cost (60%) was cutting employee compensation. The Equal Pay Act of 1963, Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 changed the way employers staffed and managed their operations, and regulators such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) required firms to re-evaluate where and how they deployed capital, including capital used to manage internal operations and supply chains. The ways these public policies, and countless others (including many that are more recent and therefore even riper for research), affect OM is interesting, important, and not completely understood. Beyond public policies affecting OM, many OM practices originated from government entities. ""The American system of mass production,"" aka ""Fordism,"" for example, was developed in significant part at the US Army's Springfield Arsenal (Hounshell, 1985). The Gantt chart, first applied by the US military in World War I (Clark, Clark et al., 1922), further exemplifies this phenomenon. A more recent example is provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which developed principles for running innovation processes that are widely used in industry today (Fuchs, 2010). OM scholars should be open to studying operational innovations from the public sector. OM principles developed in the private sector have also had an immense influence on public policy and public administration, far beyond what many OM and public-policy/administration scholars realize. In an effort to make public administration more efficient, reformers have incorporated a number of OM practices. Representative of these efforts were President Reagan's New Federalism policies, which reshaped inter-governmental relations through a shift toward contracting-out, public–private partnerships, and privatization (Cooper, 2003, 2009). Inspired by total quality management (TQM) (Deming, 1986) and business process reengineering (BPR)1717 We acknowledge that, while TQM is clearly primarily housed in the OM literature, BPR is a product of the broader management literature. Other aspects deemed OM in this section are shared with other management domains, such as information systems and organizational behavior/human-resource management. (Hammer, 1990), the New Public Management efforts of the 1990s to reinvent government (Gore, 1993; Osborne & Gaebler, 1992) pushed public governance toward performance-based processes. Starting in the early 2000s, drawing on the OM domains of automation, standardization, and cost reduction, governments around the world have pushed the digitalization of public policy and administration (Benjamin & Potts, 2018; Twizeyimana & Andersson, 2019). Numerous public agencies have experimented with Six Sigma (Maleyeff, 2007). Taken together, OM principles such as involving customers (citizens) in the process, continuous learning/improvement, process simplification, workflow/system enhancements, change management, the holistic management of technology and the people affected by it, and an emphasis on productivity as a goal, all continue to lie at the core of efforts to transform public policy, public-policy processes, and public administration overall. As the above list suggests, there are important similarities between governments and other types of organizations that OM scholars typically study. In contrast to loose groupings of people (e.g., friend networks or social movements), both governments and firms are characterized by structured management with a chain of command. Many of the processes in both sectors in which management engages are similar, including budgeting, scheduling, accounting, strategic planning, and selecting, motivating, and evaluating employees. However, there are important differences between the public and private sectors (See Table 2 for an enumeration of some key differences). Due to these differences, OM-based approaches may often be inappropriate or misapplied when adopted within the public sector, leading to failures (Kellough, 1998; Radin & Coffee, 1993). For example, consider the case of user fees (Frakes & Wasserman, 2014). In a private business, a firm will alter its products, operations, and prices to maximize profits, while paying customers expect businesses to be responsive to them. In agencies such as patent offices, administrators sought to adopt a similar strategy, by charging fees to those who applied for patents, and thinking of these applicants as the agencies' ""customers."" According to Frakes and Wasserman (2014), this myopic strategy significantly worsened the performance of the US Patent and Trademark Office on its most important mission, which is to approve patents based on their novelty and usefulness to the public, not on their contribution to the agencies' revenues. Instead, once the PTO became dependent on user fees, it began to extend ""preferential examination treatment—that is, higher granting propensities and/or shorter wait times—to some technologies over others"" (p. 602), with a significant decline in patent quality (Frakes & Wasserman, 2014). In this case, the agency best served social welfare not by covering its operating costs, which are a small portion of its impact on society, but instead by fairly allocating intellectual property rights. OM scholars are accustomed to dealing with processes characterized by bottlenecks, nonlinearities, uncertainty, and information problems. These characteristics frequently lead to discontinuities, virtuous or vicious cycles, and bounded rational managers. This worldview, which should be useful in analyzing the messy world of public policy, is not shared by all researchers in all fields. For example, Lazear (2000) celebrated economics for its insights gained from a focus on equilibrium, rationality, and efficiency—assumptions which may be directly at odds with OM researchers, particularly those who perform empirical research suitable for JOM. For example, economists often assume that economic forces will tend toward equilibrium, in contrast to the OM view that dynamics can lead to virtuous or vicious cycles (as in the bullwhip effect in inventory management). To understand how OM scholars have examined public-policy questions, we performed a structured review of articles appearing in JOM between 2017 and 2020. We also examined articles from the following operations and supply-chain journals in a less structured manner: Production and Operations Management (POM), Manufacturing and Service Operations Management (MSOM), the Journal of Supply Chain Management (JSCM), and the Journal of Business Logistics (JBL). We paid particular attention to articles accepted by the Industry Studies and Public Policy Department at POM. Finally, we examined some articles in inter-disciplinary or multi-disciplinary journals such as Management Science (MS) and Decision Sciences (DS) as we became aware of them. We do not claim this to be an exhaustive review, except for the last 4 years of JOM. Notably, we classified 13% of JOM papers in the last 4 years as having a clear, albeit sometimes understated, relationship to public policy. It is worth noting that none of these articles were accepted by the Publi","['public', 'policy', 'operations', 'management']"
Blurred Work - Life Frontiers: A Paradigm Shift in Employee Social Networking Privacy,2018,"A large number of millenials are expected to join the workforce by the year 2020. The ‘Selfie Generation ‘as they call it, differs from the previous generations in terms of their workplace attitudes, aspirations and technological adaptations. They exhibit great affinity to digital world. These characteristics of millenials are going to have a strong impact on the future workplaces. Growing popularity of digital gadgets and social media among the millennial workforce has become a cause of concern among corporate. Digital craze among employees may make them sometimes blind to the dangers of sharing sensitive information about their employers/ organizations which may result into troubles for the firms in question. Modern day employers have started monitoring their employees conduct (including monitoring the employee’s social media accounts, mobile communications, laptops etc) at and beyond official work frontiers , to their defense. But as there are always two sides to a story, this form of monitoring has put employee privacy at risk, thereby blurring their personal-professional (life) boundaries. This paper seeks to study the contemporary trends in employee monitoring and resulting issues concerning employee social networking privacy. The paper also seeks to address the ethical and legal dimensions connected with employee social networking privacy.","['blurred', 'work', 'life', 'frontiers:', 'paradigm', 'shift', 'employee', 'social', 'networking', 'privacy']"
Learn to fly: Training and competencies to support the multidisciplinary workforce needs of learning health systems,2022,"The concept of the learning health system (LHS) originated in the mid-2000s through a series of workshops and publications1-3 produced by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly the Institute of Medicine). Spurred by the urgency to generate and mobilize research evidence to improve health and healthcare, thought leadership from the NAM has galvanized the field. In just 15 years, the LHS concept has spurred the development of a robust bibliography of ways to address important gaps and deficits, spawned a dedicated journal, and infused new thinking about how to harness electronic health data to support continuous learning. Most importantly, the LHS has catalyzed remarkable opportunities for community and capacity building by providing opportunities to nurture a new generation of multidisciplinary LHS practitioners in this exciting and evolving field. The field has enjoyed remarkable growth and maturation over the past several years, as ""internal data and experience (are increasingly) and systematically integrated with external evidence, and that knowledge is put into practice.""4 The LHS workforce is critical to its success and underscores the need for workforce training and related competency building approaches to support the development and sustainability. This Special Issue offers the LHS community an opportunity to focus on our workforce—and their broad professional roles, skills, training, expertise, and lived experience—as we identify and consider academic training and professional skills needed to successfully close the gap from discovery to the use of knowledge in practice. This work is happening at all levels, from the individual health system and academic institution level to national and international initiatives. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded dedicated ""collaboratories"" that engage health systems and academic researchers to develop pragmatic research with high potential for implementation and adoption at scale. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) have established a training grant program with the purpose of ""train[ing] clinical and research scientists to have the skills to support and lead efforts to apply patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) methods and conduct PCOR research in a LHS and to facilitate rapid implementation of evidence that will improve quality of care and patient outcomes.""5 These changes are also being catalyzed at the local level. The dedicated department of Learning Health Sciences at the University of Michigan is both a harbinger and a blueprint for other academic institutions. Curricula at newer schools of medicine, including the Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine and Kaiser Permanente's Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine, endorse and espouse the importance of the LHS. In other institutions, training opportunities may live in departments of biomedical informatics, health services research, or other parts of the organization—again underscoring the requisite multidisciplinary and complementary capabilities that are needed to study and improve the delivery of healthcare. Taken together, these efforts to fund and instantiate new scholarly endeavors are key signals that building the workforce is critical to realizing the full potential of the LHS. This Special Issue features a range of training programs and perspectives representing different countries, systems, organizational structures, and topical areas to inform and inspire. Three articles in this Special Issue of the Journal examine competency development and extension in support of LHS training. In ""Competency Analysis and Educational Strategies to Meet the Demand for a Learning Health System Workforce,"" Feldman et al.6 offer direction for the development of LHS programs, including approaches to identify and address challenges during program development, and strategies to guide both new program development and collaboration across existing programs. Such direction is critical for continued field-building efforts, insofar as newer training programs will not need to start from a blank slate. Coley and colleagues,7 through the Consortium for Applied Training to Advance the Learning health system with Scholars/Trainees (CATALyST) K12 program, further advance this discussion in their commentary, ""A Call to Integrate Health Equity into Learning Health System Research Training."" The authors advocate persuasively for competency domains to be extended to reflect health equity-focused LHS science. Through real-life case studies, program components, challenges, and potential solutions are illustrated at the program, funder, and research community level. Training and mentorship in health equity-focused LHS science underscore the importance for the LHS field to recognize and build upon existing health equity work, particularly by scholars of color. Notably, the LHS K12 funders and program leaders readily adopted Equity and Justice as an eighth core domain of the LHS K12 training program. While both the Feldman and Coley commentaries offer guidance for the development of resources for such programs. Franklin and colleagues8 describe novel efforts to instill a consistent evaluation approach for scholars' relative mastery of the LHS domains in their Experience Report, ""Development of a Learning Health System Science Competency Assessment to Guide Training and Proficiency Assessment."" Here, national experts were interviewed to better characterize proficiency in competencies across the seven domain areas that comprise the pillars of the AHRQ-PCORI LHS K12 program (ie, systems science; research questions and scientific evidence; research methods; informatics; ethics of research and implementation; improvement and implementation science; and engagement, leadership, and research management), resulting in an LHS Competency Assessment. The assessment supports the LHS workforce in prioritizing and monitoring proficiency development for individuals and within training programs. It is both important and prescient for the burgeoning LHS field to have approaches to gauging expertise, given the complexity of the LHS and the skills needed for effective execution. Workforce development programs play a critical role in the LHS ecosystem. Dushyanthen et al.9 report on an innovative ""LHS Academy"" fellowship program for interprofessional clinicians to support workforce needs in ""Fostering the Use of Learning Health Systems through a Fellowship Program for Interprofessional Clinicians."" This fellowship program lasts less than a year and consists of coursework and projects to nurture participants' roles as ""digital health champions."" Program evaluation captured feedback about the program and also probed participants' reflections on their perceived barriers to participation, application of learned content in the workplace and in their work, and recommendations for program improvement. In ""Review of Applied Health Informatics Courses in a Multidisciplinary Biomedical Informatics Department,"" Motiwala et al.10 focus on the critical need for workforce development efforts to support informatics infrastructure in LHS. Like Dushyanthen and colleagues, they leverage survey-based program evaluation to assess their interdisciplinary applied health informatics program to assess the program and faculty to develop strategies for program expansion. The Experience Reports included in this Special Issue offer a bird's-eye view of programs and partnerships positioned across a range of organizations and communities of practice focused on planning, implementing, operating, or improving workforce development for LHS. Notable efforts by AHRQ and the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System feature prominently. In addition to the aforementioned work by Franklin and colleagues, Lozano et al.11 summarize the approaches, challenges, and successes experienced individually and collectively by the K12 training programs that were awarded through the AHRQ-PCORI national centers of excellence program alluded to above. This distributed and collaborative approach fostered a range of partnerships for these centers and scholars, including not just health systems, but also VA health centers and safety net providers. Program scholars hailed from both clinical and non-clinical training backgrounds and were given the opportunity to expand knowledge into practice through outreach and research experiences. The VA is an important and noteworthy example of a mature LHS in action. In this issue, the VA's extensive LHS training ecosystem, as described by Kilbourne and colleagues in ""How the VA is Training the Next-Generation Workforce for Learning Health Systems,"" explores workforce requirements in the context of research and clinical goals, funding, infrastructure, and collaboration.12 Rural clinical workforce capacity building through an adapted training program is described in ""Implementation Experience and Initial Assessment of a Rural Women's Health Training Program in Support of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a Learning Health System.""13 Here, Sanders and colleagues describe the implementation and effectiveness of a women's health rural workforce training program delivered at rural sites, sharing lessons learned that can be considered for other training programs. This work is an important contribution to the discussion about capacity building beyond the urban academic medical environment and shows how LHS programs can also be tailored to support trainees with specialized backgrounds and/or clinical interests. The VA also offers the full LHS workforce to learn and benefit from quality improvement (QI) initiatives. In ""Continuous Quality Improvement at the Frontline: One Interdisciplinary Clinical Team's 4-year Journey After Completing a Virtual Learning Program,"" Robinson and colleagues14 describe their experience and outcomes from a virtual coaching program and hands-on curriculum designed to support capacity building for continuous QI activities, a hallmark of LHSs. A unique partnership to support QI is described in the article by Vilendrer and colleagues15: ""Evaluating Clinician-Led Quality Improvement Initiatives: A System-Wide Embedded Research Partnership at Stanford Medicine."" This article describes engagement and partnership between the unit charged with coordinating clinician-led QI projects with an in-house implementation and evaluation unit. Finally, Masica and colleagues16 offer readers an opportunity to consider LHS workforce development in the context of translational science in ""The Texas Health Resources Clinical Scholars Program: Learning Health Care System Workforce Development through Embedded Translational Research."" Here, a collaboration between a large, non-profit health system and a large academic medical center to launch a Clinical Scholars Program supports workforce development focused upon later-stage translational research and engagement with community partners. The report highlights program design and operational components, which serve as guidance for others wishing to build upon similar partnerships to support LHS workforce development. Efforts to optimize the LHS workforce must also be placed in the context of the overall healthcare workforce, which itself is addressing tectonic changes, including workforce shortages and moral injury, and substantive changes to the organization, delivery, and financing of healthcare. Evidence generation and application are central to these efforts but may be difficult to embed in a healthcare climate that is occasionally or consistently ambivalent toward research.17 Reconsideration of roles, scope of practice, and licensure are likely to occur sooner rather than later as these questions—and changes—are considered and addressed. As this Special Issue illustrates, the importance of collaboration throughout the learning and competency development process cannot be overstated. In the Foo Fighters' 1999 hit rock song, ""Learn to Fly,"" Dave Grohl sings, ""Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone."" That collaborative spirit permeates this body of contributed works and the entire LHS ecosystem. For all learning health system efforts to reach their full potential, we need to fly together and assure that the workforce has the full breadth of capabilities to fulfill the virtuous cycle of using evidence at scale for transformative improvements to health and healthcare.","['learn', 'fly:', 'training', 'competencies', 'support', 'multidisciplinary', 'workforce', 'needs', 'learning', 'health', 'systems']"
Zicht op werk: grenzen aan het digitaal meten van werkenden,2020,"Keeping an eye on workers: limits to digital monitoring Technological advancements in the field of data analytics, algorithms and AI have dramatically increased opportunities for workplace monitoring. In this article, we discuss some of these digital technologies, and examine their impact on employment relationships and the quality of work. Based on desk research, literature review and interviews, the Rathenau Institute examined a wide range of digital instruments, their scientific basis, implications for the quality of work and relevant legal frameworks. Digital monitoring technologies often quantify work activities. We argue that it is important for organisations to realise that such quantification often negatively impacts both job quality and employment relationships. Responsible use of digital monitoring tools not only requires a broad societal and political dialogue about privacy, discrimination and workload but also a critical reflection on the aim of organisations to use data to understand workers, while not everything of value can be captured in data.","['zicht', 'werk:', 'grenzen', 'digitaal', 'meten', 'werkenden']"
The Key Role of Local Governance in Achieving the SDGs,2022,"Abstract This chapter looks at the crucial role that local action plays in achieving the SDGs. It begins by revisiting the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals and ponders the reasons why we should have faith in the prospect for successful goal attainment. Next, it demonstrates the importance of local responses to global problems and challenges targeted by the SDGs and discusses the motivation of local actors to contribute to the changes that need to be made in order to generate inclusive prosperity while protecting the planet. Finally, the chapter identifies some of the key barriers to local action and reflects on how we broaden the scope and improve the conditions for local people and organizations to initiate and drive change.

The UN SDGs In 2000, the UN member states agreed on eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that focused on urgent problems in the Global South, such as high child mortality rates, extreme poverty, failure to fulfill basic needs, and environmental degradation. In 2015, as the deadline for achieving the MDGs neared, evaluation reports showed that millions of lives had been saved, a billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty, and clean drinking water was available to most people in the developing countries. Most significantly, perhaps, growth in low-income countries had accelerated more than in middle-income countries. Outcomes pertaining to the fulfillment of basic needs, such as healthy nutrition, schooling, and gender equality and protection of the natural environment, were more mixed and called for the intensification of future action. Just as an athlete doing a 100-meter sprint would not think of stopping half way to the finish line, the UN had no intention of giving up its struggle to secure a shared prosperity in a sustainable world. Indeed, when the UN member states unanimously agreed on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2015, they raised the stakes and stepped up the global effort to make the world a better place while securing the future survival of humankind. The SDGs provide a blueprint for a sustainable development that allows people to grow and prosper without harming the planet and preserves these possibilities for future generations. The new goals are broader and more inclusive than the MDGs and more ambitious in targeting the root causes of poverty. Most importantly, the SDGs are universal in the sense that they are not merely goals for the Global South but target problems and challenges in all countries. The global relevance and validity of the SDGs is crucial since it underlines the common destiny of humankind, perhaps most acutely expressed by Goal 13, which prompts us to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. The SDGs address three themes: (1) social and economic prosperity; (2) fairness and social equality; and (3) environmental protection. These broad themes highlight three crucial aspects of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. There has been much discussion about possible tensions between some of the SDGs. For example, Goal 8 seeks to enhance economic growth while Goal 13 aims to reduce CO2 emissions to combat climate change. However, whether goals such as these are compatible or not depends on how they are achieved. Hence, both the development of a strong green-tech sector and the transition to a circular economy may help to make Goals 8 and 13 mutually reinforcing. The SDGs provide a common language for talking about intractable problems and the need for joint action and innovative solutions. The problems, goals, key concepts, and tools are described in the same terms in all the different languages, thus limiting ambiguous interpretations that may allow for the justification of inaction or actions that go against the SDGs. What is open for interpretation is not what to do, but how to do it. Moreover, the 17 SDGs emphasize the need for a holistic approach to making the world a better place. Agenda 2030 stresses that many of the problems addressed by the SDGs are interconnected and that efforts to meet one goal will tend to have positive implications for other goals. For example, many initiatives aiming to promote clean water and sanitation in accordance with Goal 6 will have a positive impact on Goal 3 on good health and well-being. Securing positive synergies between some of the other goals – e.g., between Goal 8 on decent work and economic growth and Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities – might be more challenging and call for a coordinated approach in order to prevent unintended negative spill-over effects. Indeed, the noble ambition of leaving no one behind can only be reached by moving forward on all of the goals and to do so by 2030. This urgent and holistic approach to goal attainment begs the question of whether there is sufficient reason to believe that this new set of global goals are achievable. The good news is that there are at least five aspects of the SDGs that greatly enhance the chance of their realization, or at least the prospect for making major progress toward goal attainment. The first aspect is that the 17 SDGs are further disaggregated into 169 targets and 231 indicators. The UN has made a huge effort to provide relevant data and measure progress on the different targets, and many individual countries are working to construct national baselines, develop appropriate indicators, and measure results. Thus, the SDGs are not merely abstract goals for a better world, but concrete and measurable targets that can be effectively assessed and monitored. Provision of data facilitates solution-oriented sustainability research (Filho et al., 2017). To this end, Future Earth has been designed as a global research platform and science-practitioner partnership that aims to provide the knowledge, ideas, and tools needed to catalyze, incubate, and coordinate transformation geared toward sustainability and the achievement of the SDGs. The second aspect that supports goal attainment is that the SDGs have been mainstreamed within all UN organizations. The SDGs are not merely a task that the development branch of the UN has responsibility for and works with. All parts of the UN system are committed to supporting the realization of the SDGs and must document their particular contributions. The mainstreaming of the SDGs is in itself a major achievement considering the fragmentation of the UN system and the many and sometimes competing agendas. The third aspect is that the UN member states are committed to using their government organizations, budgets, and policy instruments to work for the realization of the SDGs. Hence, this strategy takes into account that goals that are not supported by organizational infrastructures, financial means, and policy changes stand a slim chance of being met. In some countries, local governments have integrated the SDGs in their local governance strategy, and in other countries such as Norway, all government agencies as well as publicly financed research projects must demonstrate how they help to achieve one or more of the SDGs. Such institutional incentives are crucial for mobilizing the resources, momentum, and commitment that are needed for making real and decisive progress. The fourth aspect is that the SDGs have been cleverly communicated to people all over the world, not least by means of the catchy multicolored pictograms that illustrate each of the 17 goals. The colorful icons shown in Fig. 2.1 are easily recognizable and function as a symbol for efforts to make a better world for engaged citizens and stakeholders around the globe. The pictograms have made the SDGs come to life and gained an everyday presence on advertising billboards, pins that people wear on their clothes, and logos found on websites, magazine covers, etc. Perhaps this is one of the greatest ever communicative achievements of the UN. Opens in a new window.Fig. 2.1. The Multicolored Icons Illustrating Each of the SDGs. Finally, the 2030 deadline for achieving the 17 SDGs creates a sense of urgency. We do not have all the time in the world. The clock is ticking and we have to act now to deliver on our bold ambitions, and signal that people can take action and accomplish great things when they join forces and set their mind to do it. Here, seven years into the SDG era, the official assessment is that despite continued progress in some areas, goal attainment is not advancing at the speed required to meet the goals in time. In consequence, the SDG summit in September 2019 called for a decade of intensified action. We need global action to secure a strong political leadership and commitment to the SDGs at the level of national governments. We need government action to mobilize public institutions, budgets, and policies in the struggle to achieve the SDGs. We need people action that brings citizens, neighborhoods, civil society organizations, private enterprises, and trade unions to join forces to make progress. Finally, we need inquiring action by the media and academia in order to critically scrutinize, stimulate, and inform the search for ways to meet the goals (Fig. 2.2). Opens in a new window.Fig. 2.2. Interrelated Patterns of Action Promoting the SDGs. The UN and other global organizations play a crucial role in setting the agenda, stimulating multilateral action and monitoring progress. However, the real political, financial, and organizational capacity to drive the much-needed societal transformations is to be found at the national level. To even out the national capacities for achieving the SDGs, wealthy countries must undertake a massive transfer of aid, financial capital and investment, technology, expertise, and knowledge to less affluent countries and contribute to establishing trade agreements that are fair and favorable to these countries. Regional collaboration between neighboring countries may also spur balanced economic growth and facilitate diffusion of best practices supporting the development of effective, accountable, and democratic public institutions and free and independent media and research. Yet, despite all their resources, capacities, and formal authority, it is difficult for global institutions, supranational organizations, and national governments to make real changes on their own because it is hard for them to reach, mobilize, and engage citizens and local stakeholders. Robust transformations toward the SDGs cannot be ensured simply from above. Instead they require engagement of local public and private actors to find and employ new ways of redistributing wealth, producing and delivering welfare solutions, providing decent work conditions, facilitating transportation of goods and people, producing and consuming energy, protecting nature from degradation, etc. Local action is indispensable for reaching global goals for a sustainable future (Awortwi, 2016; Stoker, 2011; Sujarwoto, 2017). Local Responses to Global Problems Although the famous UN Agenda 21 slogan ""think globally, act locally"" tends to underestimate the need for global action, it stresses that local action holds the key to solving many of the global problems and challenges that have motivated the formulation of the SDGs. The slogan highlights the core of the argument advanced in this chapter, namely that local action is a cornerstone for solving some of the most pressing problems of our time. This line of thinking is also a central aspect of the UN's strategic approach to implementing the SDGs (Reddy, 2016). Local action refers to on-site processes and projects that aim to develop and implement concrete solutions to specific problems as they occur in real time. Research suggests that local action can accomplish things that action at other levels of governance cannot (see Brinkerhoff & Johnson, 2009). In a nutshell, the proximity of local actors to pressing problems and context-specific opportunities for action enhances their collective motivation and capacity to promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability. This proximity advances the translation of goals into concrete strategies, facilitates task coordination, accommodates the mobilization of resources, grants actors influence over decisions that affect them, and promotes social accountability. To start with, local action is crucial for securing the social embedding and adaption of the SDG goals and targets to local conditions. Local actors have first-hand knowledge about concrete problems and challenges and the possible causal relationships between them (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017). Without this local insight, it is difficult to predict what will work, to explain failure, and to develop alternative solutions that will perform better. Effective strategies for raising the level of education among children must take into account contextual factors such as the local educational tradition, existing school policies, school structure, available resources, and the job market. In the same way, decisions regarding which strategy works best for recycling waste depends on insider knowledge about the local infrastructure and local citizens' attitudes and behaviors. Another important function of local action is to facilitate the translation of the SDGs to ensure that they are meaningful and relevant for those actors who are expected to contribute to their attainment. SDGs that are well adapted to local conditions and appear important to local actors can serve as common reference points for collective efforts to foster innovative solutions. Translation of global goals into local aspirations holds the potential to broaden the base of support for the SDGs. Local action is also valuable because the proximity to concrete problem-solving tends to support a holistic approach to goal attainment. The closer you are to the complexities of real-life problems, the more difficult it gets to close your eyes to the interconnections between problems such as poverty, unemployment, and crime. Proximity stimulates holistic problem-solving. A case in point is the turn to community policing in many countries. The focus is on breaking vicious cycles between social and economic problems in a given neighborhood and high levels of crime and public insecurity, which may in turn deepen socioeconomic problems (Diamond & Weiss, 2016). Local action also has the potential to mobilize resourceful local actors to support the effort to meet the SDGs. Local authorities, private businesses, civil society organizations, and social entrepreneurs possess so-called NATO resources that are important for achieving the SDGs. Christopher Hood (1986) introduced the concept of NATO resources to draw attention to four important governance assets. N stands for nodality, which refers to an actor's centrality in terms of connections to other actors. Having a central position in a network of local actors is an important resource for mobilizing others to act. A stands for authority, which refers to the position and legitimacy that actors enjoy, which tends to condition their ability to prompt action. T stands for the treasure that an actor possesses in terms of available financial and organizational resources that can grease the wheels of collaboration and fund projects. Finally, O stands for the organizational capacity that can be invested in problem solving or in bringing actors together and secure their fruitful interactions. An illustrative example of the mobilizing capacity of local action is the role that local governments and universities played in mobilizing volunteers to plant one million trees in Iraq (United Nations SDG Partnership Platform, 2021). Another example is the mobilization of a wide range of local actors to promote innovative urban planning in Milan, Italy (Dente, Bobbio, & Spada, 2005). A final example is the European Union's LEADER program that aims to spur innovation and growth by mobilizing rural communities to stimulate tourism (Ballesteros & Hernández, 2019). Although national governments also have an important role to play in mobilizing societal actors with NATO resources, local governments and community leaders are well-placed to identify and recruit actors with relevant NATO resources and commit them to take action. If popular local politicians, well-connected public managers, and local business and community leaders are successfully recruited, they may, in turn, mobilize wider constituencies. Local action is not only invaluable for adapting the SDGs to different contexts, for enhancing holistic problem-solving, and for promoting people action. It is also a means to grant affected actors some degree of influence over the form and content of initiatives that aim to meet the SDGs. Local action tends to broaden ownership over strategies, initiatives, and projects, thus mitigating local resistance to SDG projects. Moreover, local action empowers and enables citizens and other local actors to hold local and national governments accountable for their action and inaction vis-à-vis the SDGs (Cai, 2008; Fox, 2015; Warren, 2009). By doing so, local action stimulates competent and critical scrutiny of public governance processes and their outcomes. We can now summarize by saying that although international organizations and national governments have a key role to play in prioritizing the SDGs through agenda setting, provision of funding and strategic design of incentives and collaborative institutions and platforms, local action also provides an essential support system for promoting people action and for concrete inquiry into barriers and drivers of efforts to promote the SDGs. Why Local Actors Are Likely to Contribute to Achieving the SDGs Local governance is vital for promoting the SDGs, but how realistic is it that public and private actors at local levels of governance will take on this challenge for spurring local action to achieve the SDGs rather than depending on international organizations and national governments? Although the temptation to leave the task to others is probably widespread, we point to a number of factors that may motivate local actors to contribute to meeting the SDGs. A first motivating factor is that signaling commitment to the SDGs may enhance the status and street credit of politicians, public agencies, private businesses, NGOs, and individual citizens (Nilsson, 2019). Concrete projects that help to achieve one or more SDGs can provide a powerful way of building local reputations for contributing to public value production. This reputational benefit depends on the moral force of the SDGs in a particular locale. A second motivating factor is that the SDGs address societal problems that are visible and directly felt by local communities, organizations, businesses, and families. These direct experiences place a premium on finding practical solutions to the problems of everyday life, which are concrete rather than abstract. These practical problems and the prospect of solving them justify the investment of time and resources in fostering local action. For example, working together to clean up a polluted lake may have immediate benefits for residents who live nearby or rely on the water for their livelihood. Researchers such as Benjamin Barber (2013) predict that it is the concrete experience of societal problems that will motivate local actors to take the lead in curbing climate change and responding to other major governance challenges. A third motivating factor is that getting involved in local SDG efforts may help local actors influence how society is developing while avoiding the partisan conflicts and ideological battles associated with national politics. Local governance tends to be more pragmatic in the sense of getting things done based on compromise and agreement. Although there are also interest conflicts and value disagreements at the local level, the immediacy of problems prompts actors to constructively manage their differences to find solutions that work in practice and have a demonstrable value to the public (Sørensen, 2020). A fourth motivating factor is the recognition of interdependencies between different stakeholders that necessitate the need to exchange and share resources. As Jan Kooiman (1993, p. 4) famously argues in his book Modern Governance, the complex, dynamic, and diversified problems of our time are almost impossible for public and private actors to solve single-handedly, because they need access to the knowledge and resources held by other actors. If a city or local community wants to reduce its CO2 emission, the local government will have to involve businesses and households to get them to reduce their energy consumption or use more sustainable forms of energy; if a child is performing badly at school, the teacher will need to work with parents to get them to help with homework; and if a business wants to market environmentally and socially sustainable products, they need to commit other firms as well to secure overall supply chain responsibility. A fifth motivating factor is that there is often a relatively short distance from decision to action at the local level. When local actors decide to act, there is less risk of drowning in red tape than at higher levels of governance. Red tape refers to detailed rules and regulations that hamper rather than accommodate flexible, creative, and innovative problem-solving (Bozeman, 2000). The greater the distance between decision-makers and the problem they are trying to solve, the more rules and regulations are needed to ensure coordination and compliance. In this case, obeying the rules and regulation tends to become a goal in and of itself, thus displacing attention and energy away from actual problem-solving. At the local level, decision and problem are closer and thus red tape is less likely to discourage people from investing time and energy in taking action that would obviously benefit themselves and others. A sixth motivating factor is that participation in local action is more flexible in terms of time and commitment than participation in national politics, which tends to be extremely demanding and all-absorbing. At the local level, a person can spend an hour a week helping an aging or disabled neighbor to shop, invest two nights a week in teaching adults to read, or sign up to spend every third weekend picking up garbage along the local highway. People may also engage in short-term campaigns to build shelters for homeless youth (Bryson, Crosby, & Seo, 2020), or become part-time local councilors working for equal access to the internet or seek to remove barriers to economic growth for small businesses (Shenglin, Simonelli, Ruidong, Bosc, & Wenwei, 2017; Travers, 2012). Local action provides more opportunity for ad hoc participation. A final factor that may motivate local action is that participation tends to enhance the acquisition of social and political capital. Engaging in local problem-solving helps people to build network relations that can curb loneliness and isolation for some people (Norris & Inglehart, 2013). Local participation can also be enjoyable and rewarding on a personal level or instrumental in helping individuals to build a career in an NGO, a local government agency, or a political party. Fig. 2.3 below summarizes the seven factors that can motivate actors to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs through participation in local action. Together, these factors justify high hopes regarding the prospects for engaging local actors in the promotion of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Opens in a new window.Fig. 2.3. Factors That Motivate Local Actors to Promote the SDGs. Barriers to Local Action We should also keep in mind that there are conditions that may hamper local efforts to promote the SDGs. Fig. 2.4 identifies five conditions that can limit the scope for local action. The outer circles refer to ""hard"" barriers such as laws and regulations and allocated resources and skills, while the inner circles refer to ""soft"" barriers such as tradition, habits, culture, and community sentiments. Opens in a new window.Fig. 2.4. Barriers to Local Action for the SDGs. Externally imposed rules and regulations can limit the scope for local action. Dictating to public employees, businesses, NGOs, and local citizens what they can and cannot do is likely to weaken their motivation for getting involved in local action and for developing and maintaining commitment to their own initiatives (Skelcher & Torfing, 2010). Moreover, limited local autonomy hampers open-ended exploration and development of new, innovative strategies, projects, and methods that take local conditions into account. It can also impede local action if there are limited NATO resources, professional skills, and leadership capacity among local actors. When local governments and public agencies have little to contribute in terms of funding, formal authority to act, and organizational capacity, it is difficult for them to form robust partnerships with private actors and to persuade them to chip in. When there are few NGOs and businesses with new ideas and entrepreneurial competencies, there will be less local capacity to initiate and carry out SDG projects. Another hindrance is weak leadership from local politicians, public professionals, and civil society actors. Leadership is essential for defining problems that call for local action as well as for creating momentum, courage, and commitment for creative problem-solving (Briefs, 2018; Scheyvens, Banks, & Hughes, 2016). Another barrier to local action is when the root causes of the problems that the SDGs address are products of deeply engrained local traditions and routinized practices. Traditions and routines are valuable because they build capacity to act in a complex world that offers endless opportunities for action. Without tradition, we would not know what counts as appropriate and meaningful behavior in different contexts, and without routines, people would have to think through everything they do all the time, which would impede our ability to concentrate on developing new ways of tackling problems when and where it matters most (March & Olsen, 1995). But sometimes traditions and routines become a barrier to solving the pressing problems that inform the SDGs. Many tend to be reluctant to move beyond their routines. Hence, it can be scary for communities to relinquish their traditional but harmful fishing methods in favor of embracing new untested methods, even if they promise to be more effective and better for the environment. Another example of the reluctance to change arising from customary behavior is the difficulty of preventing corruption where both public servants and citizens regard giving private gifts in return for public services as traditional and appropriate. In some local communities, there is a strong participatory culture that serves as a basis for initiating local action for the SDGs. In other communities, people may not be used to participating in local problem-solving with each other or with the local public authorities. In addition, there may be few people with the participatory skills and experiences necessary for organizing local action and weak connections between public and private actors that limit efforts to forge local collaboration. A weak participatory culture, limited organizing skills, and thin network ties can be a serious barrier for engaging actors in activities that promote the SDGs. To redress these weaknesses, organizing efforts may have to focus on picking the low-hanging fruits that give people a positive experience with participating (Ventura, Miwa, Serapioni, & Jorge, 2017). Finally, the propensity to take local action is related to how much the inhabitants identify with their locality. Weak community sentiments may suppress commitment to investing time and energy that goes beyond narrow self-interest and that discourage from forming partnerships with others in an effort to turn the local community into a better place to live. It is noteworthy that community sentiments are sometimes stronger among newcomers who have chosen a particular locality and cherish its specific characteristics and atmosphere, while people who are born in a place may be less aware of their attachment and need to be reminded of its value and potential. Hence, newcomer may be easier to mobilize than long-term residents. Communities with high residential turnover can be difficult to mobilize because none of the residents have a strong attachment and are willing to invest in its future development. Enhancing the Scope for Local Action Mobilizing public and private actors and overcoming barriers to local action in the pursuit of the SDGs not only calls for local autonomy and discretion, NATO resources, skills, commitment and leadership capacities, and community-focused efforts from local actors to overcome the barriers listed above. It also calls for active and focused support from global and national levels of governance. Table 2.1 provides a list of forms of support from higher levels of governance. Table 2.1. What Global and National Levels of Governance Can Do to Stimulate Local Promotion of the SDGs. Sustainable rules of the game Agenda setting Funding Regulation that incentivizes local action Local autonomy to pursue the SDGs Local access to relevant scientific knowledge Training programs for local entrepreneurs A decentered communication infrastructure Celebrate local achievements Diffuse of best practices Those global and national actors who have the capacity to influence the conditions under which local actors operate can do a lot that give local actors and communities more opportunity for taking part in the promotion of the SDGs. For example, global actors can promote Fair Trade Agreements that can play a role in fighting poverty and empowering local communities or can introduce CO2 emission trading regimes that prompt local energy producers to create partnerships for alternative energy sources (Hubacek, Baiocchi, Feng, & Patwardhan, 2017). National governments could integrate the SDGs into educational curriculums or delegate responsibility to local governments for initiating SDG action. Global and national public institutions, media companies, research institutes, interest organizations and independent agencies and think tanks also have an important role to play in communicating the urgency of promoting the SDGs and the crucial role of local actors in achieving them. Global and national actors have privileged ability to capture the attention of large audiences and the ability to host events that bring together actors from different levels of governance in focused discussions about what needs to be done to meet the goals of one or more of the SDGs (Hajer et al., 2015). Strong global and national actors can support promising local governance initiatives through the provision of funding in the form of special purpose grants or higher budgets for local governments, businesses and NGOs that are conditional upon progress toward achieving the SDGs (Awortwi, 2016). Moreover, not all national rules and regulations are red tape that hampers local action and innovation. Green tape rules and regulations incentivize and empower local actors to take effective and innovative action in the pursuit of specific governance outcomes, such as the SDGs (DeHart-Davis, 2009). Policy-makers at higher levels of governance may play a key role in designing green tape that motivates actors to engage in local action for the SDGs rather than shrinking their autonomy. Often, the ability of local governance actors to contribute to meeting the SDGs hinges on their access to scientific knowledge and hard facts about what works and how to avoid failure. Input from universities and research institutions is important in this respect, and it is a government task to facilitate collaboration between local communities, universities, and other research institutions that provide relevant knowledge in support for the development of local solutions. One way to do this is to create geographically-distributed university structures and to set obligations that universities will make their knowledge accessible to relevant local actors (El-Jardali, Ataya, & Fadlallah, 2018). A related task for universities and other teaching organizations is to provide practice-oriented leadership training for public professionals as well as for civil society and business entrepreneurs. Local actors may benefit tremendously from research-based knowledge about how to exploit drivers of and overcome barriers to local SDG action. Efforts to develop viable and informed strategies for promoting the SDGs also hinges on the existence of well-functioning independent and critical media and a digital communication structure that accommodates exchange of innovative ideas, coordination of activities, and the formation of partnerships (Odendaal, 2003). Local actors rarely have the capacity to accomplish these tasks by themselves and must rely on national and global actors to do so. National and global actors also have a privileged position when it comes to celebrating positive local achievements. Global prizes and awards such as ""greenest city in the world"" or ""Europe's best workplace"" are powerful instruments when it comes to motivating politicians, firms, and organizations to change their ways, and so are the many different lead tables such as the PISA ranking on school performance, and labeling systems such as CSR charters and logos for organic products (Huang, Kuo, Hung, & Hu, 2019). However, it is essential that some of these instruments for celebrating contributions to meeting the SDGs do not only celebrate those communities, businesses, agencies, and organizations that do best, but also highlight relative achievements. The initial conditions vary hugely between localities, and what is in reality good progress can end up standing out as failure. A final task for global and national actors, including global special purpose organizations, national governments, interest organizations, and the media, is to secure the diffusion of best practices and examples of local progress on the SDGs. This can be done through the digital posting of case descriptions but also and most importantly through events such as innovation camps and workshops that facilitate face-to-face interaction that accommodates mutual learning between those who work with similar problems and projects in different local contexts. Concluding Remarks In sum, local action plays a crucial role for developing and implementing concrete strategies, methods, and tools for advancing the SDGs by taking into account contextual factors and mobilizing relevant and affected actors. There are many factors that motivate public and private elites, subelites, and local citizens to get involved in promoting one or more of the SDGs, but there are also a number of barriers that hamper local SDG action and thus need to be overcome or mitigated in the future. Promotion of local projects and initiatives calls for structural support and leadership. Although local governments and business and community entrepreneurs can to some extent deliver on both the structural and leadership dimensions, global and national decision-makers also have considerable influence on the local conditions for pursuing social and economic prosperity, social equality, and environmental protection. Hence, the high hopes for local SDG hinge on global and national endeavors to improve conditions for collaborative innovation at the local level.

"Intellectual Freedom, the Right to Free Inquiry, and Digital Privacy",2020,"The extensive use of the internet and digital technology in the workplace, including universities, has transformed the work style of employees, faculty members, and students. On the one hand, it has helped employees communicate, coordinate, and collaborate on a 24/7 basis around the world, which in turn has improved productivity and work performance. However, on the other hand, it has made employees vulnerable to monitoring and invasion of privacy. Many faculty members and students feel that surveillance and computer monitoring are compromising their intellectual freedom, the right to free inquiry, and digital privacy. This study addresses how the use of computer monitoring affects the morale and performance of faculty members and students for their intellectual and free inquiry. The study uses the survey method to interview professors and students to analyze their responses with regards to monitoring their online activities.","['intellectual', 'freedom,', 'right', 'free', 'inquiry,', 'digital', 'privacy']"
Digital Workplace and Productivity: Evidence from Public Sector in Kenya,2025,"The digital workplace is a concept of how work is done while emphasizing the utilization of current technologies to enhance productivity, communication, and user satisfaction. Embracing the digital workplace is an important step toward improving service delivery in public sector entities. Public institutions in Kenya undeniably create a conducive environment for economic development. However, public sector productivity in Kenya remains a concern, hindering socio-economic transformation, global competitiveness, and job creation. There has been a long-term decline in overall productivity from 0.45 in 2009 to 0.40 in 2022 with both labor productivity and total factor productivity falling over several decades. Similarly, data showed that the productivity of government MDAs ranges from 45% - 65% which implies the existence of wastage in the majority of the MDAs assessed. It’s against this backdrop that this study assesses the effect of digital workplaces on the national productivity of public sector institutions. The study population included 433 state departments and agencies that have mainstreamed national productivity as provided by the National Productivity and Competitiveness Centre (NPCC). The unit of analysis of the study was 433 MDAs that had mainstreamed national productivity while the unit of the observations was Heads of departments of performance monitoring units in the MDAs. The formula adopted yielded a sample of 204 respondents from the target population. The study further established that digital workplace adoption was a significant driver of productivity, with the strongest direct effect among the digital dynamics components. The regression coefficient for the digital workplace was β = 0.859, p &lt; 0.05, indicating a significant positive relationship. Public institutions that implemented digital workplace technologies, such as remote working platforms, collaborative tools, and digital communication channels, recorded better employee engagement and efficiency. Digital workplace innovations support a flexible and modernized work culture, critical for addressing emerging challenges such as remote operations and hybrid working arrangements.","['digital', 'workplace', 'productivity:', 'evidence', 'public', 'sector', 'kenya']"
Strategies to Enhance Team Performance in Digital Workplaces: Review of Empirical Evidences,2025,"The effectiveness of teams is of fundamental importance in achieving organizational success, particularly within the contemporary tech-driven workplaces, where unity frequently blends with geographical boundaries. With the increased adoption of digital technologies and an increase in remote working, team monitoring has changed, which further necessitates innovative measures to adapt to the technology-driven environment. This study aims to investigate empirical evidence of key strategies to increase team effectiveness and productivity in the contemporary digital time. The study further analyzes whether factors such as effective communication, technological proficiency, elements of team adjustments, leadership styles, and digital collaboration tools promote team effectiveness at modern workplaces. Real-time feedback in digital communication platforms, virtual activities for team development, and methods for addressing issues arising from digital fatigue and miscommunication are also analyzed in this paper.

The role of the nurse in the work of the anti-tuberculosis cabinet and the prevention of tuberculosis,2023,"Tuberculosis has always been and remains one of the socially significant diseases. The work of the anti-tuberculosis cabinet is based on close interaction between the doctor and the nurse, where the role of the nurse is very high. It is important to monitor the patient’s compliance with the rules of personal hygiene, as well as conduct sanitary and educational work. It is easier to fight the disease if the patient has full information about it. In the context of digitalization of medicine and the emergence of artificial intelligence, there are changes in the work of a nurse. Analyzes and examination data, especially X-ray data, are transmitted to the doctor’s workplace. Systems for automatic evaluation of results are being created. The duties of a nurse may change. Currently, more responsibility is assigned to conducting screening surveys of the population, their evaluation and monitoring of results, and assistance in maintaining documentation","['role', 'nurse', 'work', 'anti-tuberculosis', 'cabinet', 'prevention', 'tuberculosis']"

Transforming dietetics curriculum‐ challenges with drift and overcrowding,2024,"In the journal's first Editorial this year, Williams described the growth of academic dietitians and their role in leading the curriculum for developing the profession.1 That editorial acknowledged the disparity between the amount of pedagogical and curriculum research compared to disciplinary research and called for strengthening evidence to support innovative curriculum. I have been an academic for over three decades and have led the design, delivery, renewal and accreditation of our curriculum including managing quality improvement processes as required by university policy. Many of the papers presented in this current edition showcase educational research, and other papers have implications for curricula. This Editorial draws on literature, my experiences in curriculum design and renewal, and the papers presented in this issue to improve the understanding of the challenges in transforming curriculum. The curriculum can be considered a plan for what students will learn in a course or program. It is how discipline knowledge and standards are organised, structured and made meaningful, for and by students as well as aligned to the university's vision and mission. Curriculum design and renewal are processes to deliver high-quality learning, teaching and assessment in higher education. Health professions curricula require continual renewal. The Lancet paper on the challenges and opportunities for educating health professionals after the pandemic starts with the premise that we are at a critical moment for change.2 COVID-19 was a catalyst for innovation in higher education. We are entering an era in which the digital sciences are developing new educational technologies. Competency-based education evidence has become the expected outcome of a university degree, along with the increasing recognition of interprofessional teamwork. One of the papers in this issue combines these areas by using case studies to understand how digital systems can contribute to the interprofessional delivery of dietetics services.3 Dietetics has investigated our future workforce implications, with the Council of Deans of Nutrition & Dietetics' research highlighting our need to realise a broader scope of practice and roles to impact health.4 In this issue, several papers continue to call for expanding the scope of practice. Donnelly et al. reviewed the literature on private practice dietetics, noting that most papers were from Australia, where the increase in graduate employment in private practice has implications for curriculum including placement opportunities.5 Other research in this issue on the public perceptions of dietitians as experts in nutrition and perceptions of dietetic services has implications that task academic dietitians to better prepare graduates in advocacy, continued scaffolding of behaviour change technique applications, and improve graduates ability to use digital support and personalisation to provide comprehensive services, including online and telehealth services.6 Universities aim to deliver an integrated curriculum,7 adopted from medical education where basic science is coordinated with practice across the curriculum. This integration should lead to better retention and skill acquisition through repetitive and progressive development. Australian accreditation standards for dietetics education state the expectation that universities demonstrate a program curriculum that 'includes integrated teaching, learning and assessment that meets current and emerging areas of practice, enabling students to meet the competency standards'.8 Students should experience a delivery that is coherent and coordinated, with competency development scaffolded and assessed across academic periods. Davies et al. acknowledge this need for integrating Indigenous experiences across curriculum in this issue. Their study considers how to decolonise dietetics teaching practice with their co-designed cultural immersion teaching activity based on the Aboriginal process of learning.9 Curriculum design works through phases of needs assessment, development of learning outcomes, content, instructional strategies and resources, embedding the pedagogical processes used for teaching delivery backed up by quality assurance or evaluation. Dietetics programs typically use a constructivist approach in design, whereby students construct knowledge and meaning from their experiences.10 Students now have an active role, with the shifting of responsibility for learning to a student-centred model, different from the teacher-led philosophy when I trained. We are also being challenged to use contemporary and technologically supported learning and teaching strategies including the evolution of Generative Artificial Intelligence to consider how we incorporate into curriculum delivery.11 Academic dietitians enact the curriculum while addressing the needs of diverse learners to ensure this scaffolded and coherent education experience prepares student dietitians for graduate work. I have seen curriculum delivery likened to completing a jigsaw puzzle, where all the elements fit together without unnecessary or unintended overlaps or gaps.12 In enacting curriculum, each academic dietitian uses their experiences and research interests to deliver their bit of the jigsaw. This raises a question as to how we ensure a learning experience that we are confident is responding to professional standards and expectations. Demonstrating that curricula meet accreditation and competency standards13 is a complex task. In making explicit this complexity, it is necessary to produce documentation that 'maps' the intentions, inputs and outcomes. University staff spend considerable time creating public and internal documents that represent their curricula. Curriculum mapping is a process that indexes and relates all elements of delivery and is now an essential step in quality assurance processes.14 Mapping produces the formal curriculum. Academic dietitians use mapping to demonstrate where competency standards are sequenced and assessed. It has been my experience that a detailed curriculum map can assist staff to see where their bit of the jigsaw fits, how it relates to the whole and empowers the teaching team in curriculum delivery. There is an adaptive challenge in implementing the planned curricula. While academic dietitians have significant autonomy in developing curricula, we need to encompass university values and directions, workload allocations, available resources in addition to accreditation requirements. Effective curriculum delivery requires teaching expertise and the ability to hold a vision for a coherent course developed by shared beliefs. Academic dietitians must engage and placate diverse stakeholders while monitoring and responding to accumulating professional and societal developments. Can we ever complete the jigsaw? Given the expansion of dietetics courses, there is evidence that the academic workforce is relatively young and gaining teaching experience, but as they are responsible for curricula they have significant influence on graduates.15 Research has demonstrated that academic dietitians acknowledge the continued need for curriculum renewal described as 'aiming for a moving target' and the gap between what is being taught and the work roles.16 Historically little attention has been paid to the quality of academic teaching, with the focus on research performance.17 The criticism of academics more generally is that they are driven by their own teaching experiences and teach topics related to their expertise with limited interactions with the formal curriculum.18 Previous curricula research has found that this personalising in teaching delivery produces a lived or hidden curriculum as decisions are made about new inclusions, exclusions and unintentional emphasis.19 The hidden curriculum emerges based on assumptions, values and beliefs. This hidden curriculum needs to be conceptualised and formalised as it represents the curriculum as experienced by students, but there is little research on the hidden curriculum in dietetics. However, we do recognise its existence in aspects of dietetics curricula, for example in education related to body weight.20 The impact of moving away from the curriculum plan is the loss of constructive alignment, whereby connections between elements of learning (scaffolding) can become uncertain or confusing. Constructive alignment is based on constructivist learning theory supporting an outcome-based approach to curriculum design.10 When academic dietitians make individual topic or unit changes to their 'pieces of the jigsaw' without reference to the map, this causes the curriculum to 'drift'.21 In my experience, curriculum drift can occur in just one academic period as new staff are employed and/or result from a lack of communication between the teaching team. Curriculum drift can have a serious impact if not kept in check. However, curriculum drift is one way in which academics demonstrate responsiveness to calls for change without having to deal with the administrative burden of documentation approval processes and remapping.18 Making substantial changes, such as unit structures and assessments, requires layers of bureaucratic approval. In many instances, universities are not agile in reacting quickly to professional needs because of a culture of accountability and risk management. There are concerns that curriculum renewal has the potential to result in overcrowding. Other health professions have noted that the overcrowded curricula outcome is symptomatic of concerns to not fall behind.22 High cognitive load results from incorporating more content where we run the risk-disrupting links between theory and practice.23 This is likely to make the teaching and learning experience less satisfying, and increasing cognitive load has a potential impact on student mental health.24 Tweedie et al. proposed a shift to using concept-based curriculum for dietetics, with one rationale being to reduce the risk of overcrowding.25 Dietetics competency and accreditation standards8 are evolving from just focusing on the traditional domains of practice, yet I contend that our curricula are still predominantly structured for traditional graduate roles. Private practice employability is a useful example of how to expose students to the combinations of new competencies required. This is discussed in this issue by Molderings et al., who raise the question of how we encourage entrepreneurship and innovation to meet evolving healthcare demands.26 Their study demonstrated the value of a 12-month mentoring circle postgraduation, and the authors called for curriculum delivery that could better prepare graduates for business, marketing and financial management skills for these emerging areas of practice. Our reality is that the dietetics curriculum cannot cover all areas considered important. Even during the time students are at university (4–5 years), we are seeing changing employment markets and new practice areas emerging. It could be argued that it is almost impossible for new graduates to demonstrate all competencies required in the workplace. However, academic dietitians must look for ways to design responsive and integrated curricula to meet these challenges. Therefore, it is more pertinent to view the curriculum as a complex adaptive system rather than a set of jigsaw pieces. This systems view can assist to visualise and comprehend the complexity and multidimensional links between the elements of curriculum, including placement contributions. Despite the need for academics to focus on curriculum design, there is a paucity of approaches that produce a holistic visualisation and synthesis of the various curriculum elements. We urgently need to use different approaches to renewal and mapping that are meaningful to stakeholders. Dietetics has started to engage with the concept of programmatic assessment, using a systematic approach to triangulate decisions about a student's competency development through purposefully selected assessment tasks collated longitudinally.27 To advance our ability to improve our integrated curriculum, I propose building up our expertise in systems and design thinking as a way forward. Systems thinking aims to understand how various intersecting and interrelating curricula components impact a student's trajectory to becoming a member of the profession.28 This issue includes an example of curriculum development, where a design thinking approach was used to innovate the curriculum in eating disorder content, including co-designing with students for understanding the learning experience and elevating the student's voice in curriculum renewal.29 Overhauling curriculum has financial implications for workload and resourcing, but we must advocate for this support within universities. Academics can no longer be only knowledge experts; however, many academics have little formal training in teaching, pedagogy and educational research methods and may have limited access to instructional designers or other staff to assist. Academic dietitians need to engage heavily in professional development, including aspects of educational theory, to deliver transformative learning experiences and produce educational research.30 The 2024 Australian Government Universities' Accord was a major review of higher education in Australia.31 The Accord noted the issue of no requirement for formal education qualifications and the potential for mandating minimum teaching qualifications in the university sector. The papers in this issue demonstrate educational research from academic dietitians which is building our evidence base and discipline research with implications for curricula. For example, I refer to studies on new methods for assessing placement readiness using oral interviews instead of traditional OSCEs32 and technology use in improving the validity and reliability of dietary assessment methods.33 Readers should be impressed by the breadth of novel studies in this issue. Also impressive are the diverse research methodologies employed to answer the research questions informed by varying epistemologies. The journal's high-quality educational research is critical for transforming dietetics curriculum. This Editorial was written on the lands of the Whadjuk people of the Nyungar nation.","['transforming', 'dietetics', 'curriculum‐', 'challenges', 'drift', 'overcrowding']"
Features of organization of labour of Belarusian workers,2023,"The article presents the results of a study of the peculiarities of the organization of labor of Belarusian workers, which has already undergone changes in the context of digital transformation and innovative development of the economy, and requires some improvement in the Republic of Belarus. The organization of labor is presented from the standpoint of the methodology of labor economics and methods of sociological analysis. New methodological approaches to monitoring the organization of labor based on sociological methods and economic and mathematical tools are presented. The factors influencing the state of labor organization and working conditions in the workplace are discussed. Analysis and assessments were obtained using an expert database of opinions of Belarusian workers. The results of the assessments showed that there are a number of national peculiarities in the organization of labor, which are associated with the reasons for changing jobs, with working conditions and wages at the workplace, with the availability of additional income for workers, with the level of job satisfaction. It is proved that: in Belarusian organizations, the authority of the leader is high, and he determines the desire of employees to perform an additional amount of workload; work with better working conditions and a smaller workload is a significant priority when choosing the trajectories of the labor movement of workers in Belarusian organizations.","['features', 'organization', 'labour', 'belarusian', 'workers']"
Digitalization of economic life and social stratification in Ukraine: features of the relationship,2025,"The article analyzes the mutual influence of digitalization on economic life and social stratification in Ukraine. The potential of social stratification theories in explaining digital inequalities is clarified. Based on data from a 2024 monitoring study by the Institute of Sociology of the NAS of Ukraine, the indicator of the use of digital tools in the workplace was analyzed in relation to the financial situation, employment status, self-assessment of status position, and objective class affiliation. The results of the analysis, obtained using the explanatory capabilities of classical theories of social stratification, indicate the existence of several trends. The Marxist approach came true in cases where digitalization in the workplace is more widespread among the employed population with the lowest level of material deprivation, among the self-employed, and among representatives of the class of small and medium-sized owners. The fact that skilled workers are more active in using digital devices and technologies than those in routine non-physical work is quite close to functionalist explanations of digital inequality when different demands on the labor market regulate and select the necessary people with the appropriate skills. Despite the dependence of digitalization on the level of financial situation and subjective social status, slightly less use of digital tools was recorded among the wealthiest respondents compared to the rich, and among those who placed themselves on the highest rungs compared to those who placed themselves in the middle. This phenomenon is explained by the Weberian interpretation, according to which according to which the prestige of being at the highest levels of the social hierarchy lies not so much in possessing the digital qualifications as, as in exercising the power.","['digitalization', 'economic', 'life', 'social', 'stratification', 'ukraine:', 'features', 'relationship']"
Stopping the Resuscitation When Family Is Present,2017,"DEMOGRAPHICS Case title: Stopping the Resuscitation When Family Is Present. Patient name: Patricia Yu. Case description and diagnosis: A 38-year-old woman with widely metastatic breast cancer in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Simulation scenario developers: Luke Devine, MD, MHPE, CHSE FRCPC; Laura Hawryluck, MD, MSc FRCPC; Michael D. Christian, MD, MSc, FRCPC. Target audience: Resuscitation (Code Blue) team leaders/members. CURRICULAR INFORMATION Educational Rationale The decision to terminate resuscitation efforts can be a challenging one, and the presence of family members at the resuscitation can make this decision even more difficult. Some decision aids exist to help inform the decision to terminate resuscitative efforts. It is a judgment that must take into consideration the patient's pre-existing comorbid conditions, the circumstances leading up to the resuscitation, and the resuscitative efforts themselves.1 In the 2015 American Heart Association guidelines,2,3 it is suggested that clinicians should not hesitate to cease resuscitative efforts when functional survival is highly unlikely or when return of spontaneous circulation cannot be achieved.4 Functional survival is based on many factors, including comorbid disease, initial arrest rhythm, witnessed versus unwitnessed arrest, and others. Physicians may often find it difficult to make decisions about ceasing resuscitation, especially if a family member is present, and it can be especially difficult for medical residents when they first assume the role of resuscitation team leader. The hospitalization and death of a patient have been shown to have significant physical and emotional consequences for families.5 However, having family members present during a resuscitation allows them to be present during what may be the last moments of a loved one's life. This practice also allows family members to witness the significant efforts being performed in an attempt to bring their loved one back to life.6 How to best facilitate family member presence at a resuscitation, however, continues to be the source of some debate.6,7 Allowing family members to be present during a resuscitation may have positive psychological consequences for them, and this practice often does not interfere with care from the medical team.7,8 However, in simulated practice, one study found that a family member's presence during resuscitation affected medical residents' abilities to perform key actions.9 Providing residents with simulated opportunities to lead resuscitation situations where a family member is present and in which they need to determine when to cease resuscitative efforts may help prepare them to do so in real life. We developed a simulated case of a patient with end-stage cancer, in which resuscitative attempts are designed to be unsuccessful and where a family member is present at the bedside. The simulation, associated debriefing, and teaching are used to review the appropriate Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols, to teach leadership and communication skills, to discuss strategies to help determine when to cease resuscitation, and to discuss the need for emotional support for both families and team members during and after the crisis situation. Target Audience The scenario is designed for residents who are about to transition to the role of resuscitation team leader. At our institution, this is a group consists of internal medicine residents as they enter their postgraduate year 2. Based on their previous workplace and simulation-based training, it is presumed that most (if not all) participants would be able to apply ACLS skills and crisis resource management skills in the case of a ""straightforward"" pulseless arrest. With appropriate modifications, this case can be used to address the learning needs of other groups, such as critical care, anaesthesia, obstetrics and pediatrics residents, practicing physicians, or learners from other healthcare professions such as nursing and respiratory therapy. Regardless of the target audience, it is important to ensure that the learners have appropriate background knowledge and experience, because the other challenges in the scenario will likely introduce too much extraneous cognitive load to be a valuable learning experience for more novice learners.10 Learning Outcomes This is a challenging simulation that offers the learner the opportunity to practice teamwork and crisis management skills in a difficult situation where a family member needs emotional support. In addition, the decision to terminate the resuscitation needs to be made. This allows for a discussion on debriefing and further learning around these issues. At the end of this simulation, learners should be able to: Demonstrate the application of ACLS skills during a resuscitation [Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies ""medical knowledge and patient care,"" CanMEDS competencies ""medical expert""]. Demonstrate effective interpersonal, crisis resource management skills as they relate to resuscitation (ACGME core competency ""interpersonal and communication skills"", CanMEDS competency ""communicator,"", ""professional,"" and ""collaborator""). Identify factors that should be considered when making a decision to terminate resuscitative efforts (ACGME core competency ""medical knowledge"" and ""patient care,"" CanMEDS competencies ""medical expert,"" ""health advocate,"" ""professional,"" ""communicator""). Implement strategies to involve a family member during a resuscitation without it affecting the quality of the resuscitation (ACGME core competency ""interpersonal and communication skills,"" CanMEDS competencies ""communicator""). Guided Study Questions What are the considerations that inform a decision to terminate resuscitation efforts? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of family member presence during resuscitation? What strategies can be used to facilitate family member presence during a resuscitation without their presence adversely impacting the quality and duration of a resuscitation? What strategies can be used to explore divergence of team opinions on when to cease resuscitation, listen and receive feedback as team leader during the resuscitation, improve collaboration, and support team members (as a team leader) when ceasing resuscitation in the presence of distraught families? PREPARATION Personnel/Roles Patient's mother (confederate). Ward nurse (confederate). Respiratory therapist (RT, confederate). Spiritual care/social worker (confederate). Resuscitation team leader (learner). Resuscitation team members—intensive care unit nurse, anesthesia MD, resuscitation team junior resident, resuscitation scribe (optional roles for other learners). The number of learners can be varied on the basis of availability and local resuscitation team composition. The scenario can involve a multidisciplinary group of learners or participants from a single discipline assuming the various resuscitation team member roles. In settings where a spiritual care or social worker is not part of the resuscitation team, their role in supporting the family member can be assumed by the ward nurse or can be assigned to one of the participants during prebriefing. Equipment Required High fidelity mannequin Noninvasive blood pressure cuff Three-lead electrocardiography (ECG monitor) Pulse oximeter, capnography Intravenous pole, saline bags, syringes, connecting tubes, facial tissue box. Not in simulation room (available outside room) Airway supplies: ambu bag and mask, nonrebreather mask, oral and nasal airway, endotracheal tube, laryngoscope(s), and oxygen supply (wall, tank, or simulated) ACLS medications: including but not limited to epinephrine, amiodarone… Resuscitation cart with defibrillator We have successfully run this scenario substituting ""lower-fidelity"" equipment when necessary and using appropriate prebriefing to maintain realism. For example, an empty syringe has been used to simulate any medication required, as long as the team clearly specified what and how much medication was being administered. A simple compression mannequin and patient monitor can also be substituted for the high-fidelity mannequin. Duration Prebrief: 3 minutes (longer if participants are unfamiliar with the simulation environment and principles). Simulation: 15–25 minutes. Debrief: 20–30 minutes. Room/Mannequin Setup The scenario begins with the mannequin lying in bed on a medical ward with no monitors attached. The patient has 100% fraction inspired oxygen by nonrebreather facemask on at the start of the scenario. The mannequin is unresponsive, has no pulse, and is in sinus rhythm at 105 beats per minute. The patient is on continuous oxygen. Two peripheral intravenous lines are in situ. The resuscitation cart is available outside the room. The patient's mother and the ward nurse (both confederates) are present in the room at the start of the scenario. The mother has a fearful and panicked look on her face. Prebrief Our typical participants have had significant previous prebriefing regarding the simulation center and simulator function and principles. These include the establishment of a safe learning environment where assessments are formative, performance is confidential, and mistakes are seen as learning opportunities.11 Cognitive aids are allowed to be used because their use is also encouraged in the clinical setting as a potential means to improve performance.12 This scenario is often incorporated as part of a simulation half-day. The orientation to the half-day outlines that the scenarios will require the residents to demonstrate appropriate application of ACLS skills but will also require the application of higher level skills, such as leadership and other crisis resource management skills. To prevent loss of psychological fidelity, participants are aware that time telescoping (where the scenario is ""fast forwarded"" by several minutes) may occur and have experienced this in other scenarios. Stem for the Learners You and your fellow residents are on your internal medicine rotation and are participating in morning signover. You are the members of the Code Blue resuscitation team. A ""Code Blue"" is called overhead directing you to a wardroom of a patient you do not know. Background and Briefing Information for Facilitator/Coordinator's Eyes Only The resuscitation leader (learner) will arrive at the code along with the other resuscitation team members. The roles of the patient's mother, ward nurse, spiritual care/social worker, and RT will be played by confederates (see text, Supplemental Digital Content 1, https://links.lww.com/SIH/A321, information for confederates). All other resuscitation team member roles will be assumed by participants (this can be done before the start of scenario or roles can be assigned by the team leader). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) will have been started by the ward nurse. The spiritual care worker and RT arrive 1 minute after the code has been called. The patient will not improve despite resuscitative efforts. The scenario is designed to anticipate the team leader and team members' responses to the distraught family member's presence. There is also tension within the team as the ward nurse, who has previous critical care experience, recognizes the futility of further resuscitation, and pushes the team leader to consider stopping. The RT, however, has an emotional connection to the patient and finds it difficult to accept the idea of ceasing resuscitation. Despite this, the RT will make several comments during the resuscitation that the patient's end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) never rises greater than 10 mm Hg. PATIENT DATA BACKGROUND Patricia Yu, the patient, is a 38-year-old woman who was admitted from home 2 weeks ago after a seizure secondary to brain metastases. She has a history of widely metastatic breast cancer, to the lung, brain, and bone, which was already metastatic at diagnosis 1 year ago. Her disease has recently progressed despite third-line experimental chemotherapy. She has received 5 doses of low molecular weight heparin for a deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism that was diagnosed 5 days ago and was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a possible superimposed pneumonia. Before her recent acute decline, she has had worsening respiratory function secondary to progression of her underlying lung metastases and had been requiring 50% fraction inspired oxygen for the past 7 days. Patricia has been struggling overnight with increasing shortness of breath. The team was called several times; a chest x-ray was done that showed no change compared with one performed a day earlier. She was given a dose of furosemide without improvement in her dyspnea. She has continued to worsen and has been on 100% oxygen for the last hour. Suddenly, she has become nauseated and has started to retch. Her eyes rolled back in her head and she became unresponsive. The registered nurse who was in the room with her could not get her to respond. She could not feel a pulse, called a Code Blue activating the hospital's resuscitation team and started CPR. SCENARIO PROGRESSION AND FLOW The resident should start initial management of the resuscitation with focus on appropriate application of ACLS skills (Table 1).TABLE 1: Scenario EventsWhen asked, the ward nurse will provide a history for the patient (or if not asked after three minutes, they will provide further information without prompting). The learner should ask about advanced directives (ie, ""code status""), which have been under discussion but have not yet been determined or documented. The details of these discussions are not immediately available to the resuscitation team. The mother mentions that the patient's husband is en route from home and is not answering his cell phone. After 2 minutes of CPR, where the patient has organized electrical cardiac activity but no pulse (pulseless electrical activity), the patient deteriorates into asystole. The team will continue to run the resuscitation. The patient will remain in asystole until the code is stopped. If the patient is not intubated in the first 5 minutes, the RT will suggest intubation and successfully intubate the patient. Continuous EtCO2 monitoring will be initiated, and it will not rise greater than 10 mm Hg. As the simulation progresses and it becomes increasingly clear that attempts at resuscitation are not working, the scenario is built to anticipate the code team leader's responses. Two minutes into the scenario, the patient's mother will become increasingly distraught and begin to speak louder saying ""Patti, hang on, Patti wake up, Patti why won't you wake up? Think of your children… You have to try Patti you have to try."" The resident may ask the family member to leave. If this occurs, the spiritual care/social worker will say, ""I will calm her down, let her stay."" The spiritual care/social worker will then talk to the family member quietly, and the family member will move into the corner still sobbing. If the resident persists in wanting the mother to leave, the mother will yell and scream on their way out, ""You have to save her, she is all I have, you have to save her!"" ""How could you do this?"" If the resident does not ask the family member to leave and does not ask a team member to attend to the mother during the resuscitation, she will continue to intermittently use the lines, ""You have to save her!"" ""She has to get better…She is so young! She is my only daughter!"" She becomes increasingly more distraught and obstructive, impairing the resuscitation. If a team member is assigned to explain the situation and the ongoing resuscitative efforts to the mother, she will quietly interact with them and not impede resuscitative efforts. Depending on the time available for simulation and debriefing, the time is often accelerated (ie, at 10 minutes, it is announced by the ward nurse that resuscitation has been taking place for 15 minutes, and at 15 minutes, it has been taking place for 20 minutes). If/when the resident decides to stop the resuscitation, the family member will say pleadingly (to nobody in particular), ""No! What am I going to do, I can't lose her. There must be something somebody can do?"" At this point or after 15 minutes (real time), the ward nurse will ask the code leader, ""What do you want to do? Should we call it? I think we should stop it, we have been running the code for 20 minutes, I think we should stop."" If the code team leader decides to continue, the facilitator will stop the code 5 minutes afterward and debrief. The RT emotionally suggests that resuscitative efforts should continue because the patient is so young and has young children. ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT This scenario is used formatively. Instructors are offered ACLS-based checklists and teamwork checklists as aids to assist in identifying performance gaps. Example checklists can be found in the supplementary digital content (see figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, https://links.lww.com/SIH/A322, ACLS checklist). A specific checklist to assess performance in facilitating family member presence at the resuscitation is not used. We consider the family member to be part of the ""care team"" and that interactions with the family member can be assessed as part of the global assessment made. The Ottawa Global Rating Scale may be used to assess performance of crisis resource management skills.13 DEBRIEFING GUIDE We conduct our debriefings with critical care physicians who are both trained debriefers and content experts, to ensure that they are able to provide supplementary teaching when appropriate. The debriefer generally uses an advocacy-inquiry approach but will employ other techniques when appropriate.14 The confederates participate in the debriefing to provide insight into how they felt the team interacted with them during the scenario. Because adherence to ACLS guidelines is only one of the learning outcomes of this scenario, the debriefer must ensure that an inordinate amount of time is not spent debriefing only about this. However, if significant performance gaps occur, they should be specifically addressed. The following questions can be explored during the debriefing, after allowing the leader and team to discuss what happened. They give the debriefer the chance to provide supplementary teaching when appropriate and, for the group as a whole, the opportunity to explore any emotional reactions to the scenario: How do you decide when to terminate resuscitative efforts? What influence does the presence of a family member have on this decision? How does the patient's prognosis and previous end-of-life discussions impact this decision? What, if any, is the hospital/institution's policy on the presence of family members during resuscitation (facilitator to review in advance)? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of permitting family members to be present? Were the needs of the family member appropriately attended to during the resuscitation? How was the family member kept involved and informed? How did her presence impact the resuscitation? What strategies can be used to facilitate and support family member presence without it impacting on the quality of resuscitation? What do you do if their presence is negatively impacting resuscitative efforts? How do resuscitation team leaders and members cope with the emotional and psychological toll difficult resuscitation experiences can have? How do you go back to your ""usual"" work after a resuscitation? What supports are available after a particularly impactful experience? What responsibility do you have as the resuscitation team leader to establish a shared mental model and to facilitate collaborative efforts during a resuscitation? How do you ensure that other team members' voices are appropriately heard during a resuscitation? How do you address conflicting opinions on when resuscitation attempts should cease? SUMMARY AND COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS SIMULATIONS This case illustrates some of the challenges that can arise when a family member is present during resuscitation and some of the difficulties associated with deciding to terminate resuscitative efforts within a resuscitation team itself. This scenario serves as a stimulus for debriefing and future learning about these complex issues. Residents who participated in this scenario have found it to be very realistic and stressful, stimulating learning in a way that a simple discussion would not. They almost universally felt better prepared to deal with these complex issues in real life. The performance of residents in the scenario varies considerably, potentially because of previous experience, but always leads to valuable debriefing discussions. Many residents continue resuscitations for longer than the supervising critical care physicians would if they were the team leader, and some do not cease resuscitation before the simulation ""times out."" The ability to appropriately attend to the family member's needs and to demonstrate good crisis resource management skills also varies considerably. Infrequently, residents have strong emotional reactions after the scenario. Although these have usually been sufficiently explored during the standard time allotted for debriefing, the debriefer is asked to be available to explore further at a later time if needed and notifies participants about how to cope with strong emotional reactions after running a resuscitation. This case allows the learner to practice running a resuscitation with a distraught family member present. We discuss that in general, family member presence should be facilitated, even if the patient is a child or pregnant woman, as long as their presence is not impeding resuscitative effort or as long as emergent procedures, such as emergent cesarean section, are not being performed. If family members are aggressive, extremely unstable emotionally, cannot be calmed, or are suspected of having been involved in abuse of the patient, they should not be permitted to be present.15 As previously mentioned, there has been conflicting data about whether family members affect the quality of care delivered during resuscitation.7,8 In previous studies, it may be that experienced code leaders are able to provide high-quality resuscitation while facilitating family member presence, whereas residents struggle to do so.7,9 We believe that by allowing residents the opportunity to practice leading a resuscitation with family members present in a simulated environment, we may better prepare them to perform an effective resuscitation in real life, while allowing family members to potentially accrue the benefits of being present during resuscitation. In our experience, well-trained confederates and pilot testing of the scenario have been very effective at creating an appropriate amount of realism and emotion. Although it has been debated if the simulator should be allowed to die during a simulation, we feel that it is essential in this scenario to provide an opportunity for residents who are or will become resuscitation team leaders to explore these difficult issues.16 Evidence exists to suggest manikin death during simulations is acceptable to residents.17 This scenario portrays a patient where ongoing resuscitation is futile given her underlying widely metastatic cancer, prolonged asystole, and an EtCO2 of less than 10 mm Hg for approximately 20 minutes.18–20 Because the patient also had metastatic cancer, the chances of survival to discharge of hospital are lower, with one meta-analysis showing an overall survival to discharge of 5.6% without factoring in additional variables such as prolonged asystole or low EtCO2.21 Allowing the learner to work through a scenario where they will need to decide to cease resuscitative efforts provides an opportunity for the learner to discuss what influences their decision in this scenario in particular and to also discuss what influences decisions regarding when to cease resuscitative efforts in general. This scenario allows them to debrief about the challenges associated with making such a decision, how to best deal with family member presence, and how to effectively lead a resuscitation team.","['stopping', 'resuscitation', 'when', 'family', 'present']"
Web of Mutuality: Relational Integrity in Critical Care Nursing,2023,"Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, relationships with patients and colleagues were the fuel that kept nurses coming back day after day. Consistently identified as the most ethical and trusted profession for more than 2 decades, nursing has enjoyed positive regard and admiration by patients for its ethical standards, reliable care, and presence.1 Teams comprised of diverse clinicians and other health care workers created a foundation of competence and confidence that contributed to safety, quality, and camaraderie. Leaders and organizations, responsible for creating a supportive environment, invested in programs of nursing excellence such as American Nurses Credentialing Center’s Magnet or Pathways to Excellence programs. In many communities, there were partnerships with health care systems and the people they served. In some places there was a sense of shared purpose and solidarity.But things have changed. Levels of violence against nurses have skyrocketed.2,3 Patients are turning against nurses’ expertise and advice in favor of unsubstantiated treatments or practices, and disrespect has become normalized.4 Health care teams are fractured by staff turnover, short-term assignments by externally employed nurses, and a “brain drain” of experience as the workforce is populated by less experienced clinicians.5 Communication is transactional and largely relegated to disembodied electronic memes or texts. Leaders and organizations are struggling to compensate for losses after the pandemic and are relying on historical strategies of increased throughput and efficiency to balance the budget. Nurses and other clinicians continue to be asked to do more with less. Societal upheaval, conflict, and uncertainty have destabilized relationships in neighborhoods and communities. Arguably, the relational integrity of everyone has been eroded.Relational integrity, a key component of moral resilience, refers to the dynamic interplay of the personal integrity of everyone engaged in the delivery of health care.6 This includes clinicians, health care workers, leaders, communities, and the people served—our patients and their families. Beyond personal integrity, it encompasses the values and commitments inherent to our professions, as outlined in our codes of ethics. Relational integrity is reflected in our choices, behaviors, actions, and professionalism, and it acknowledges that our moral compass is primarily executed in the context of relationships with others. This type of integrity refers to the inevitability of our personal integrity being tethered to, and thus influenced by, the integrity of patients, other clinicians, leaders, and the institutions within which we practice. Our interdependence and interconnection with each other are reflected in myriad ways including the micromoments of connection that occur every day. Collectively, we resonate with each other’s integrity when it is manifest and when it is degraded. We detect these signals of alignment or misalignment in our bodies, hearts, and minds. Relational integrity fluctuates in practice settings between everyone being whole and undiminished and their wholeness being fractured temporarily or permanently.The quality of relationships between clinicians and patients, interprofessional clinicians and their leaders, and with the broader community is influenced by relational integrity. As a dynamic ecosystem, it involves mutual respect, skillful communication, and authentic collaboration. Maintaining relational integrity is key to building strong relationships among clinicians, patients, and interprofessional teams, and to gaining the respect and collaboration needed for desired results. It encompasses effective, mindful communication and is essential for achieving positive patient care outcomes, fostering moral resilience, and promoting staff engagement and fulfillment. When relational integrity is intact, all parties feel seen and heard, communication is transparent and honest, and there is respect for patients’ experiences and clinician’s expertise. Empathy, understanding, trust, and curiosity flourish, thereby contributing to everyone’s wholeness and sense of belonging. When relational integrity is fractured, clinicians do not feel supported, respected, or empowered; likewise, staff morale and engagement can suffer and may lead to increased moral suffering or burnout. This breakdown can result in breaches of trust, poor collaboration, ineffective communication, delayed interventions, medical errors, and ultimately poorer patient outcomes.7 This dynamic web of relationships extends into communities and society at-large. Beyond the walls of health care organizations, there are complex social, political, economic, racial, and cultural forces that impact the personal, professional, and relational integrity of clinicians and those they serve. When there is alignment in values, behaviors, policies, and practices, integrity thrives. When patterns of degraded relational integrity accumulate in a context of constrained work environments, societal and community disintegration, conflict and violence, the insidious erosion of the integrity of the health care enterprise and the people in it becomes undeniable.It’s a busy night in the emergency department (ED). Nurse Isaac clocks in for his night shift and receives the nursing shift report from the outgoing day shift nurses. There are 8 rooms in Issacs’s section of the ED, each separated by curtains. Because of the high patient census, 15 patients are shuffled into the section that was built to accommodate less than half that number. Isaac is the only nurse in his section tonight. He pauses when he notices the name of the ED physician in charge for the evening, Dr Fay. He recalls their prior interactions have been challenging.Anthony, a 65-year-old man, arrives at the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and high blood pressure, as well as a positive family history of acute coronary syndrome. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is ordered by Ava, the triage nurse, while Ruby, the clinical nursing assistant, takes Anthony in a wheelchair to Isaac’s section and places him on a cardiac monitor with a pulse oximeter and blood pressure cuff. Isaac is preoccupied, attempting to deescalate the ire of a patient waiting over 2 hours to be seen by a doctor for a superficial laceration to their arm who is demanding to speak with management.Meanwhile Chris, the ECG technician, has the printout of the ECG in hand and is waiting outside a patient’s room to share the results as the doctor finishes assessing the patient. Five minutes later, Dr Fay steps out of the room and is handed the ECG report; it shows non–ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). After taking the ECG printout from Chris, Dr Fay mutters something unintelligible and enters the room where Isaac is attending to the irate patient. Dr Fay comments to the patient that there is an urgent situation requiring Isaac’s attention and that the patient’s issues will have to wait. Isaac and Dr Fay hurriedly enter Anthony’s bedspace to find him diaphoretic and dyspneic, with chest pain described as a 9 out of 10. Isaac quickly introduces himself to the patient but is cut off by Dr Fay, who introduces themself as “the doctor.” Dr Fay performs an assessment on Anthony and then proceeds to walk out of the room before being stopped by Isaac, who asks for verbal confirmation of the plan of care. Dr Fay tells Isaac that orders can be seen in the electronic medical record (EMR). Isaac reminds Dr Fay to order a respiratory swab because Anthony will need those results to be admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). Dr Fay nods dismissively and walks off. Isaac turns toward Anthony, noticing his anxious expression, and reassures him that the team is doing their best to help him and asks if there is anyone he would like Isaac to contact.Isaac initiates his own assessment of the patient. He repositions Anthony to support his breathing and titrates supplemental oxygen to an appropriate rate given his history of COPD. Isaac builds rapport with Anthony through small talk as he implements Dr Fay’s orders, which have appeared in the EMR. Isaac notices that the respiratory swab was not ordered. He knows that hospital policy requires that patients admitted to the hospital must have a respiratory swab test result before being transferred to a room. Wary of Dr Fay’s reaction to being reminded a second time, Isaac opts to use the electronic messaging system to send the doctor a reminder to order the swab.Over the next 5 hours, Isaac’s attention is split across 15 patients. Despite the high patient volume, limited resources, and no relief, Isaac manages to keep up with his most critical patients, to the chagrin of those patients who are more stable yet still in need of care. Finally, he sees that a bed has been made available in the CICU for Anthony. Isaac immediately calls up to the floor to give a nursing report. The receiving CICU nurse notes that the respiratory swab result has not been recorded and reminds Isaac that they will need those results before Anthony can be transported.Exasperated by the delay, Isaac checks the EMR to see that Dr Fay has neither ordered the test nor acknowledged his electronic message. He leaves his section to remind Dr Fay in person to place the orders. The doctor tells Isaac to wait while they review a resident’s charting for another patient. Isaac stands anxiously at the desk. He looks back at his section and sees several colleagues gathering around Anthony’s room. A code alarm is triggered, and Isaac and several doctors rush over to the room to find Anthony cyanotic with agonal breaths and oxygenation of 60%. Anthony becomes pulseless, compressions are started, and he is intubated. Return of spontaneous circulation is achieved after several rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.Anthony has been stabilized for now, albeit in worse condition than before. Ava, the charge nurse, calls the CICU manager to expedite transfer to the floor. Isaac overhears Dr Fay commenting to Ava that this could probably been avoided if Anthony’s nurse had not been distracted. Ava responds by saying that Isaac is one of the most capable nurses on the team, and Anthony is fortunate to be in his care. Isaac finally gives his hand-off to the nurse in the CICU, who says about the missing respiratory swab, “Aren’t you aware of the hospital policy?”Clinical practice is fundamentally relational work where patients and health care workers meet each other in a complex, often uncertain, and rapidly evolving context. Each person in the dynamic brings with them their unique moral fingerprint of values, beliefs, and principles along with their cultural and social practices. Our clinical work engages our human vulnerabilities and interdependence. Relational integrity includes being true to one’s own moral compass while establishing effective engagement and boundaries in relationships and decisions.6 The inter-connection of everyone’s integrity is particularly vital when considering the situations that clinicians must navigate, balancing competing obligations to their patients and their surrogates, the institutions where they practice, and the broader society. Clinicians such as those in Isaac’s case must consider what they owe their patients and each other in the context of health care relationships, and what commitments and expectations they are willing to enact and hold themselves and each other accountable for.Respecting everyone’s humanity, especially the people we serve, is a crucial component of relational integrity.6 Isaac demonstrates this when, amid a crisis, he introduces himself before conducting his assessment and when he builds rapport while providing care and reassurance to ease Anthony’s anxiety. Relational integrity is upheld when we attune to the needs of others and respond in ways that nurture respect and wholeness. Isaac noticed Anthony’s expression of concern, and despite the time constraints, paused to reassure Anthony and offered to reach out to people important to him. Throughout the scenario, Isaac connected with his core values of respect for the inherent dignity of his patients and prevention and minimization of harm by prioritizing those at greatest risk of compromise; he did all this, to the best of his abilities, in a fair, equitable, and compassionate manner. Research suggests that when there is alignment between organizational and health care worker personal and profession values, the necessary conditions for compassion to arise are enhanced.8 Isaac leveraged his knowledge, skills, and experience to navigate the complexity without exacerbating the tenuous relationships and circumstances that he found himself in. Although it is not explicitly stated, he likely used a variety of self-regulatory skills and self-stewardship practices to support his ability to remain stable amid the chaotic ED.8,9As illustrated in the case, teamwork is necessary for safe, high-quality care. Relational integrity leverages the shared interdependence and humanity of the entire clinical team. It depends upon solidarity of purpose and invites the contributions of all to achieve the desired patient outcomes, organizational priorities, and professional goals.6 When a team is “divided, lacks solidarity, or is weakened by cowardice or ineffective leadership, it can disable the entire group.”6 Relational integrity is fundamentally inclusive of the diversity of values, perspectives, and contributions of everyone and creates an environment where no one is left out. Personal and professional integrity is a foundation for relational integrity. It requires knowing what one stands for and having the confidence and courage to defend against threats or challenges while maintaining respectful relationships with others. Ava stood firm in her values of respect and fairness when she responded to Dr Fay’s appraisal of Isaac’s performance. She leveraged her integrity by constructively offering an alternative view and modeled respectful engagement with someone holding a different perspective. This illustrates the small ways that integrity can be fortified or eroded by the behaviors of a few. When one person’s integrity is upheld, relational integrity thrives; when it is compromised, the collective integrity of everyone is eroded. This expanded view of integrity enlarges the sphere of individual integrity to include awareness and sensitivity to the integrity of others and helps to define and honor the boundaries of relationships, roles, and authority.Although this scenario is fictional, it reflects the lived experiences of health care providers and their patients. Further, it also highlights some of the explicit and implicit challenges and advantages to relational integrity. While there are individual decisions that impact the patient and professional experiences, there are also decisions made at the social, political, and institutional levels that trickle down to impact those individual decisions. Relational integrity resides within a dynamic social-ecological context that is impacted by the interplay among complex and often dissonant influences. Imbalances in power or authority, constraints imposed by hierarchical systems, and dependencies on others to enact one’s responsibilities creates challenges to shared purpose and values.6 Intact personal and professional values and integrity are necessary to inform group process, clinical practice, and organizational policy and culture. Alignment with organizational values is needed to support and encourage clinicians to meet their individual and shared moral commitments and organizational priorities without disproportionate stress, distress, or degraded well-being.Whether an individual is a nurse, doctor, medical technician, or ancillary staff, the shape of one’s practice is formed by many hands and executed through relational engagement, trust, and collaboration. In Anthony’s case involving the ED team who transfers him to the CICU, there were numerous junctures where relational integrity was fractured. The doctor and nurse assigned to the patient have a history of poor communication and a lack of trust. The nurse hesitates to speak up when he notices a change in the patient’s condition, because the doctor has a pattern of dismissing concerns. The patient’s condition deteriorates, eventually requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The lack of communication and trust between the doctor and nurse delays the initiation of appropriate treatment, resulting in a longer hospital stay and increased risk of complications. Other members of the ED team such as Chris, the ECG technician, also hesitate to breech the role-based hierarchical norms of the ED. Dr Fay demonstrates a pattern of dismissive responses to the suggestions of other team members and engages in gossip and degrading verbal and nonverbal communication. An interpersonal slight between the CICU nurse and Isaac during the handoff add to the adversity.These dynamics occur within an environment where already depleted clinicians are expected to safely manage unrealistic numbers of patients without sufficient resources. As a result, their ability to be flexible and collaborative is significantly impaired. Where there is a lack of trust, transparent communication, and collaboration, nurses may begin to feel increasingly frustrated, unsupported, and ignored.10 They become hesitant to speak up and advocate for their patient’s needs, as they fear being reprimanded or ignored. Burnout ensues as the nurse becomes disenchanted with the work environment, and moral suffering escalates as the gap between values and actions become more discordant.8 The accumulated stress, burnout, and moral residue contributes to attrition and ongoing recruitment and retention challenges. One in five health care workers have quit since 2020, and a recent survey by Elsevier Health found that 47% plan to leave their jobs by 2025.11 This loss of personnel is bound to further disrupt relational integrity in an already strained health care system. These cumulative circumstances can be understood as breeches of commitments and values by health care organizations or leaders who have implicitly promised to provide the resources necessary to fulfill one’s role requirements.In a broader sociopolitical and organizational perspective, Isaac begins his shift by walking into an unsafe practice arena, whereby he is expected to care for and monitor 15 patients by himself.12,13 It is an impossible task that is the current reality for many nurses in the United States. More than 90% of nurses say that their workplaces are understaffed.13 Meanwhile, decade’s worth of studies demonstrate that patient outcomes are improved by increasing nursing-to-patient staffing. Driscoll et al14 conducted a systematic review that suggested staffing more nurses reduces the risk of adverse events and in-hospital mortality.Indeed, inadequate staffing is a systemic issue that needs to be addressed at the legislative and institutional levels of care. However, legislators can often be too distanced from the consequences of well-intentioned but inadequate or even harmful legislation, making it hard for them to improve hospital conditions. What follows is a breech in relational integrity that reverberates from political and organizational policies and practices that undermine the ability of nurses and other health care workers to practice in accordance with their personal and professional values. When these spheres of relational integrity are fractured, it initiates a cascade of degraded relational integrity among leaders, other health care workers, and the people to be served. It animates a narrative of “Us vs Them,” rather than pulling stakeholders into shared purpose and commitments. Furthermore, in the face of scientific data supporting increased staffing to ensure safe patient care, historical budgetary patterns that relegate nursing services to a flat cost rather than a value proposition allows health care leaders to continue to balance the budget by cutting nursing services.15,16 This way of operating could be changed without legislative mandates, but it would involve a fundamental paradigm shift.Relational integrity is fractured when there is a dissonance in values between clinicians and staff and their health care organization’s values.8 When clinicians do not have the time, resources, or support to enact their professional commitments, personal and relational integrity is compromised. The degree of organizational effectiveness is negatively correlated with moral injury scores among nurses during the pandemic.17 These high-level patterns shape the context of care in our scenario.Embedded within the broader sociopolitical context, relational integrity is challenged by an unhealthy hierarchical culture of practice. There are 2 significant moments when deference to hierarchical norms led to a delay in communication that placed Anthony at risk. The first is when Chris, the ECG technician, delays interrupting Dr Fay to present Anthony’s ECG results, an important step toward early identification and intervention on the patient’s behalf. The second moment is when Isaac steps away from his section to remind Dr Fay to order the respiratory swab. In these instances, both Isaac and Chris are concerned that interrupting the doctor would be a sign of disrespect to the hierarchical positioning of the physician. Throughout the scenario, Dr Fay demonstrates a pattern of dismissive responses to the suggestions of other team members and engages in gossip and degrading verbal and nonverbal communication. Relational integrity is compromised when any member of the team engages in behaviors or communication that causes interpersonal harms. Vertical or horizontal interpersonal violence, bullying, disrespect, or microaggressions can erode trust and the integrity of the moral community.18 These patterns are likely exacerbated when stress and exhaustion become the norm rather than the exception.Whereas communication—the ability to receive and relay information to achieve mutual understanding—is the cornerstone of quality health care, a hierarchical culture that places excess emphasis on rigidly defined roles and their perceived significance and authority can hinder quality health care. Such cultures can lead to communication failures, as those perceived as lower-ranking individuals refrain from speaking up when higher-ranking individuals fail to listen or respond. In one study, nearly one-third of the health care team feared repercussions from flagging potential errors.19 This can have unintended consequences for patient outcomes. When members of the clinical team do not raise safety concerns, it can contribute to medication errors, cause delays in treatment decisions or procedures, and compromise patient hygiene and relational care.20 Left unchecked, rigid hierarchies can suppress the voices of lower-ranked individuals, placing them in conflict with their professional responsibility to speak up on behalf of patient care and thereby eroding the relational integrity of everyone.Clinicians such as those in the case study attempt to navigate the pressures that such hierarchical cultures place on interprofessional communication by using the direct messaging system within the EMR. Direct messaging allows for a secure, real-time exchange of patient information, which can aid in timely and accurate decision-making and agreement over the plan of patient care. Naturally, the implementation of digital communication between health care professional leads to a decrease in their face-to-face communications. Despite the potential for faster communication, digital communication can undermine the collective responsibility for an effective, relational workflow.21 Electronic communication tends to be cryptic and devoid of the context that is needed for understanding the meaning behind the words, which can undermine the alignment of the goals and plan of care among team members who may have diverse perspectives and values.22,23 When conflict among the team is not surfaced or addressed, overt and covert responses begin to emerge that further degrade team functioning and relational integrity.Relational integrity thrives when we know each other as human beings rather than solely by our roles or positions. Less face time among the clinical team negatively impacts the relationship-building necessary for establishing trust and camaraderie between colleagues. Trust-building includes building faith in others’ capability, character, and communication.24 Effective teamwork is facilitated when we know who we can count on, when our capabilities are appreciated and understood, and when we speak with good purpose and clarity.24 Data suggest that physician responsiveness to direct messaging is influenced by the level of trust established between themselves and nurses.25 Myriad factors influence the building of trust, including time pressures and prior experiences.25Indeed, building trusting relationships among clinicians takes time, and until sufficient time is invested, clinicians’ interactions will be premised on underdeveloped trust or patterns of interpersonal betrayal. Evidence has demonstrated that, during the pandemic, nurses experienced betrayal by health care professionals they once trusted, by their leaders, and by people outside of health care.17,26 The time required to nurture interprofessional trust, however, is undercut by the high turnover rate often brought on by burnout. In a recent survey of nurses, physicians, and advanced practice providers, 25% were considering switching careers, with nearly 90% of these respondents citing burnout as the primary reason.27 Until there is actionable commitment from hospitals and legislators to alleviate underlying causes of burnout, interprofessional relationships among clinicians will continue to suffer from high staffing turnover.28,29The spheres of relational integrity involving the sociopolitical, health care organizations, and team culture have a direct impact on the patients nurses are dedicated to serving. Anthony and the other patients under Isaac’s care likely experienced varying degrees of dignitary harms associated with not being listened to or known as a person by the people caring for them.30 Despite Issacs’s efforts to engage with Anthony within the complexity of the situation, it is likely that both parties experienced a relational disconnect. When nurses cannot provide the care they know they are capable of and are committed to, it begins to erode their identity as nurses, which creates stress, distress, and moral suffering.31 Over time, these types of residues accumulate and impact nurses’ personal, professional, and relational integrity and their well-being and commitment to their jobs and the profession.Although the scenario presented serves to highlight the challenges to relational integrity, it also provides a framework for imagining how intact relational integrity would alter the course of Anthony’s care. Beginning with the sociopolitical integrity surrounding health care infrastructure, an intact investment would guarantee sufficient staffing so that no clinician would walk into a scenario where they are expected to manage an unsafe number of patients. Strategies such as mandated staffing ratios have been proposed as an external lever to achieve this goal.30 Data suggest that improved staffing ratios are related to decreases in in-hospital mortality, missed care, and likelihood of death.12,14 Whether mandated ratios will ultimately achieve the intended goals remains to be sufficiently studied.32 Regardless of the mechanism to accomplish the goal, nurses should be empowered and authorized to make allocation decisions based on patient needs and nursing capacities, including limitations on safe admissions, transfers, or discharges. As the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses has long envisioned—“a health care system that is driven by the needs of patients and families where acute and critical care nurses make their optimal contribution” might become a reality.33 Accomplishing this goal will require a fundamental paradigm shift that begins with aligning organizational values with the professional values of those delivering care. New models of shared governance and cocreated solutions and accountabilities for processes and outcomes will be necessary.In the typical hierarchical structure of health care, it’s necessary to question authority in cases of a potential error or unsafe situation. Hierarchy has its place, but it can also hinder open communication, as medical professionals may be hesitant to challenge their superiors without fear of negative consequences.34 Relational integrity depends upon an environment of inquiry, discernment, and safety to bring concerns to the attention of those authorized and responsible for addressing them without fear or shame.6 Unhealthy hierarchical structures and unbalanced power dynamics in health care teams create barriers for open communication among team members and can further undermine relational integrity. Nurses may find it challenging to express their opinions to higher-status individuals due to fear of criticism or rejection. When there is an environment where nurses’ or others’ views, perspectives or input is systematically silenced or discounted, a key element of relational integrity is violated. Clinical authority gradients between nurses and physicians can exacerbate this issue.35 An unhealthy hierarchical structure can reinforce attitudes of superiority or entitlement by those with more authority and lead to dismissive behaviors toward the input of nurses in clinical practice. This may result in suboptimal patient care, as physicians, for example, might overlook important details that nurses bring to their attention and cause patient harm. This was evident in Anthony’s case when opportunities to incorporate the input of all the team members were limited or discredited.Without the negative consequences of hierarchy and various types of interpersonal harms influencing the communication between health care team members, the case study may have played out differently. First, Chris, the ECG technician, would have felt more comfortable interrupting a patient examination to hand the ECG report to Dr Fay, who would in turn have appreciated Chris’s attention to an urgent situation. Early recognition of NSTEMI leads to earlier interventions that ultimately improve patient outcomes.36 Next, Dr Fay and Isaac might have come to the same understanding on the importance of ordering the respiratory swab as a necessary step for transferring Anthony to a higher level of care. Isaac would not have hesitated in speaking up and would not have had to step away from his section to find the doctor. We can imagine how these hierarchical structures can negatively affect patient care when nurses fear speaking up or advocating when they perceive a concern. Consistent with the tenets of relational integrity, individuals, teams, organizations, and the broader community/society have a shared responsibility to contribute to a climate of relational integrity (Figure).Relational integrity is the foundation of trust and collaboration among health care professionals that leads to improved job satisfaction, increased clinician retention, and better patient outcomes. It fosters effective communication, shared decision-making, mutual respect, and a supportive work environment, creating a positive and collaborative team dynamic. Intact relational integrity in health care settings is critical to promoting and maintaining a collaborative and supportive environment that benefits both patients and health care professionals. Strategies such as adequate human and material resources, empowering nurses to make allocation decisions, new models of shared governance, and cocreated solutions and accountabilities for processes and outcomes can shift organizational values to align with professional values and create a climate of inquiry, discernment, and safety, ultimately improving the quality of care provided.We acknowledge the contributions of our nursing colleagues in helping us enhance our understanding of this topic. We honor the contributions of all nurses in all roles and specialties who are serving so many people in need of their services.","['mutuality:', 'relational', 'integrity', 'critical', 'care', 'nursing']"
Developing a National Strategy for Integrating Wellness Programs into Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems in Nigeria: A Conceptual Framework,2023,"The integration of wellness programs into Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems (OSHMS) is essential for fostering a healthier and more productive workforce. In Nigeria, where workplace-related health challenges remain prevalent, a national strategy to incorporate wellness programs within OSHMS could significantly enhance employee well-being and organizational efficiency. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for developing such a strategy, addressing the interplay between occupational safety and wellness in promoting holistic workplace health. The framework emphasizes the need to align wellness programs with existing OSHMS structures, focusing on preventive measures, mental health support, and chronic disease management. Key components include policy formulation, capacity building, stakeholder engagement, and resource mobilization. By integrating wellness initiatives such as stress management, physical fitness programs, and nutrition education into OSHMS, the strategy aims to reduce workplace illnesses, absenteeism, and healthcare costs. This conceptual framework draws on global best practices and contextualizes them to Nigeria’s socio-economic and cultural realities. It highlights the role of government agencies, employers, and employees in fostering a culture of safety and wellness. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of digital tools and data analytics for monitoring and evaluating program effectiveness, ensuring continuous improvement. Case studies from similar interventions in other countries are analyzed to illustrate potential outcomes and challenges. The proposed framework identifies barriers such as insufficient funding, limited awareness, and lack of regulatory enforcement while offering solutions like public-private partnerships and community-driven initiatives. The findings underscore the transformative potential of integrating wellness programs into OSHMS, not only improving workplace health but also contributing to national economic growth. This study concludes with actionable recommendations for policymakers, industry leaders, and public health practitioners, advocating for a collaborative, data-driven approach to implementation.","['developing', 'national', 'strategy', 'integrating', 'wellness', 'programs', 'into', 'occupational', 'safety', 'health', 'management', 'systems', 'nigeria:', 'conceptual', 'framework']"

"P-067 ALGORITHMS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MACHINE LEARNING: NEW LEARNING AND THE FUTURE OF WORK",2024,"Abstract Introduction Worldwide, workers and employers are being confronted with algorithmically-driven automation in the workplace — through the introduction of specific procedures to digitally manage and affect positively and negatively major changes in the future of work. This will require new learning, new educational approaches for digital development, risk education and management for our community of practice. Methods This presentation is drawn from a content analysis of the current literature reviewing three major areas: algorithms, artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on the key automated procedures and their definition and effect on workers and workplaces. In addition, the presentation is informed by the current work being undertaken at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Results The current focus on the effect of artificial intelligence for work and employment has tended to focus on the impact on overall employment, and skills demand. Yet, the most obvious and direct impact of machine learning is on how work is undertaken, coordinated, monitored, evaluated and most importantly- its effect on the quality of working life and wellbeing. Discussion While the emphasis on this presentation is on the United States, the approach and issues presented provide a more general outline and basic template for a more global approach and analysis. Conclusion Algorithm-enabled Al systems are maturing quickly, but international regulatory approaches are lagging and voluntary approaches seem ill-defined with little agreement by developers and risk managers.","['p-067', 'algorithms,', 'artificial', 'intelligence,', 'machine', 'learning:', 'learning', 'future', 'work']"
Creating efficient channels of communication towards pharmacists' attitudes and trends in pharmacies in Serbia,2016,"Recognising the need of pharmacists for current information in the field of science, legislation and conducted activities, The Pharmaceutical Chamber of the Republic of Serbia (FKS) has launched a magazine Pharmacy Practice (AP) and an official web page. The research was conducted in order to determine the change in preferences and attitudes of pharmacists towards various channels of information, the level of awareness on certain contents of FKS's magazine and web page and specific demographic changes in the period 2008. - 2014. The data was collected through a voluntary and anonymous online survey on two occasions - in 2008. and 2014. About 12% of the members of FKS participated in the survey. Demographic structure of the participants within the monitored period has shifted from predominantly middle aged (41-55) to younger population (25-40). Development and propagation of information technologies (IT) has led to the increase in accessibility of the Internet at workplace (from 8% to 54%) and at home (from 73% to 91%), and the number of Internet users has increased by 27%. Preferred channels of information in 2014. were the digital media (over 50%), while the AP stayed on the same level (over 30%), as did monitoring of certain contents on the FKS website. The focus of interests was changing, but interests in legislation and continuous education remained on a high level.","['creating', 'efficient', 'channels', 'communication', 'towards', ""pharmacists'"", 'attitudes', 'trends', 'pharmacies', 'serbia']"
Coercion and Consent in Automated Management,2024,"The ongoing debate surrounding the impact of automation on the workforce tends to focus on physical labour and repetitive tasks. However, it is noteworthy that the automation of managerial functions is also closely tied to the automation of jobs held by workers. This paper provides a review on workplace monitoring, focusing on its relationship with the ongoing process of datafication. By examining various techniques and technologies, the contribution specifically highlights the coexistence of coercion and consent as a characteristic feature of digital Taylorism. To inform the analysis, it suggests a cross-reading of two theoretical frameworks, namely Labour Process Theory (LPT) and surveillance studies. Thus, it argues that more consensual practices are now used to hide the coercive dimension of management by transferring it from human bosses to automated ones, rather than truly replacing it. Furthermore, the paper highlights how this shift is closely linked to the increased use of gamification, rankings, self-tracking attitudes and real-time monitoring, as well as to the growing precariousness that permeates both productive and reproductive spheres.","['coercion', 'consent', 'automated', 'management']"
Occupational psychosocial risks identification and assessment at Labour Offices in the Czech Republic,2023,"Psychosocial risks at work can be defined as a set of risks resulting from the employee's interaction with the work environment, the nature and organization of work and interpersonal relationships both inside and outside the workplace. Data collection was provided through an online questionnaire survey in December 2021 in 5 selected Labour Offices in the Czech Republic. A special questionnaire was prepared and tailored to the needs of workers exposed to demanding communication with clients. This questionnaire survey was done after the pilot study to ensure the adequacy of the questions, comprehensiveness of the contents, and clearness of instructions. The questionnaire was divided into the mandatory part with Demographic data (7 questions), Work with the client (10 questions) and Resilience (10 questions). Optional areas of the questionnaire covered Communication with superior and team (9 questions), Nature of the work (8 questions), Work organization (9 questions), Job evaluation (5 questions), and Job change, digitalization and unexpected crises (4 questions). A total number of 1168 questionnaires were included for further analysis. The study group consisted of 93% women and 7% men. The biggest age group of respondents was between 50 to 64 years (33%). The results showed the highest satisfaction of employees in the area of communication at the workplace, whereas employees were most dissatisfied with work changes. For 58% of respondents, communication with the work team and superior impacted their job satisfaction. If there was a conflict or escalation of communication when dealing with a client at the counter at the Labour Office, only 1.7% of respondents stated that they had equipment at the workplace place to signalize and monitor the potentially dangerous clients. Our results demonstrated several very problematic areas of psychosocial risks at the workplaces of Labour Offices.Acknowledgements:This result was financially supported by institutional support for the long-term conceptual development of the research organization for the years 2018–2022 and it is a part of the research task 10-S4-2021-VÚBP “Possibilities for intervention measures for employees exposed to demanding communication with clients in public administration with a focus on employment offices”, solved by the Occupational Safety Research Institute in cooperation with the National Institute of Public Health in the years 2021–2023.This research was supported by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic - RVO(National Institute of Public Health - NIPH, 75010330)","['occupational', 'psychosocial', 'risks', 'identification', 'assessment', 'labour', 'offices', 'czech', 'republic']"
Development of recommendations for implementing simulation modeling and blockchain technologies in certification system of the radio electronic industrial production,2022,"The most topical task is to increase competitiveness of industrial products, which is closely connected to permanently increasing competition in the international market and necessity for enterprises to comply with the requirements of regulatory and technical documentation. Certification is the main tool in ensuring high quality products of industrial enterprises. This work is devoted to elaboration of recommendations for improving certification system on the example of ensuring compliance of radio-electronic industrial products with requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union technical regulations on the technical means electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Under conditions of the digital economy rise and development, it is advisable for manufacturers of industrial products to introduce simulation modeling technologies to create digital twins of their products and to conduct tests for compliance with the EMC requirements at the design stage to ensure that certification tests are passed in laboratories from the first. The authors estimated the main risks arising from simulating this type of tests using the ""probability – damage"" matrix; and also, a number of measures is proposed to minimize the risks of test results reliability reduction for digital twins. It is advisable to thoroughly work out the radio-electronic product circuit and electrodynamic model to ensure the input data sufficiency for software and hardware complex in implementation of the digital tests. Besides, special attention should be paid to the rational selection of computing devices, workplaces, test modes and necessary parameters of radio-electronic industrial products to be analyzed. After completing digital testing during the design phase, it is rational to monitor the results of certification tests to collect information and improve digital twins. To achieve reliability and transparency of the certification test results, the authors propose to apply an algorithm based on the blockchain technology and characterized by introduction of a unit to automatically register the test results, encode and place them in a secure database accessible to a number of users by specially formulated requests, which are protected by a specialized private key.","['development', 'recommendations', 'implementing', 'simulation', 'modeling', 'blockchain', 'technologies', 'certification', 'system', 'radio', 'electronic', 'industrial', 'production']"
Project Workforce Management Using Cloud &amp; and Cost Optimization with Artificial Intelligence,2025,"In the era of digital transformation, effective workforce management and cost optimization have emerged as critical priorities for organizations worldwide. This study explores the integration of cloud-based technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance workforce management systems. Traditional methods often fall short in managing remote teams, forecasting staffing needs, and reducing operational overheads. By leveraging cloud platforms, organizations can achieve universal accessibility, real-time monitoring, automated scheduling, and streamlined communication. Meanwhile, AI empowers cost optimization by enabling predictive analytics, intelligent resource allocation, automation of management functions, and the development of smart marketing strategies. The research highlights how AI-powered tools, such as machine learning-enhanced OCR, IoT-based monitoring systems, and robotics, are revolutionizing data analysis, cost control, and productivity enhancement. Key findings indicate a growing industry shift toward cloud adoption, with projections that by 2035, nearly all enterprises will operate on cloud-based systems. This paper underscores the importance of combining cloud and AI technologies to build agile, scalable, and cost-efficient workforce ecosystems, ultimately paving the way for a future-ready digital workplace.","['project', 'workforce', 'management', 'cloud', '&amp;', 'cost', 'optimization', 'artificial', 'intelligence']"
Health in digital environment,2022,"Office work is associated with movement restrictions, muscle stress, burnout and other risk factors that negatively affect the health of working - age people. The coronavirus epidemic has changed the labor market: neither employers nor employees were prepared to tackle the challenges of moving to remote work. Therefore, search for solutions to preserve health of remote workers in the context of self-isolation and digital transformation is a priority medical and social task. Pilot research for examination of the office-workers state included interviews, psychological, neurological tests and methods of instrumental visualization. The aim of the study was to identify the signs of the emotional impact of remote work and develop exercises to prevent physical inactivity, as well as technologies for monitoring of individuals’ health. The survey revealed that 80% of office workers have stress and burnout in an epidemic situation, as well as a loss of interest in work and professional achievements. Burnout was accompanied with increased irritability, sleep disorders. Neurological examination revealed muscle spasms and “tunnel” neurovascular disorders in the cervical spine and postural displacement in all persons. Electrophysiological research indicated cerebral acidosis and brain hypoxia in 50% of examined individuals. The programs for postural correction and cerebral metabolism included special coordination and breathing exercises. Recommendations to healthy lifestyle and workplace reorganization were given to all persons. Digital transformation is a challenge that requires changes in legal, organizational, psychological and infrastructural approaches to preserve the health of remote workers in the new environment.","['health', 'digital', 'environment']"
Mainstreaming disability inclusive employment in international development,2022,"People with disabilities are under-represented in the global workforce, and this problem is often particularly acute in the 'global south'. This special issue seeks to provide new perspectives on why this is the case and comprises seven papers focused on disability inclusive employment. We deliberately wanted to place this collection in the Journal of International Development as a core development publication, rather than in a disability specific one, because we think it is important to 'mainstream'1 disability within development so that the international community can develop an increased understanding and awareness of disability dilemmas. The challenges faced by disabled people need to be tackled as part of all development thinking and programming. When disabled people do work, they generally do so for longer hours and lower incomes, have fewer chances of promotion, and are at greater risk of becoming unemployed for longer periods. (Tripney et al., 2015, p. 11) The Sustainable Development Goals' (UN, 2015) call to 'leave no one behind' is particularly pertinent for people with disabilities, for whom being excluded has often been their regular experience to date. However, this is now beginning to change as recognition and funding for disability-focussed intervention programmes and research are rising up the international development agenda. This collection of papers covers a range of issues pertinent to the topic of disability inclusive employment from different practical and theoretical standpoints and focuses on a range of countries and contexts in the 'global south'. We invited contributions from a wide range of authors, intentionally encouraging those who had not previously written for academic journals, to submit, including NGO practitioners, representatives of organisations of people with disabilities (OPDs) and other allies and activists. Support during the writing process was available to those who needed it, and opportunities to be involved in reviewing other papers in the collection were also offered. Thus, these papers reflect an aspiration for different perspectives to be brought in various dilemmas and challenges to be highlighted regarding the progress towards achieving a disability inclusive society generally, and specifically towards people with disabilities having access to meaningful employment on an equal basis. At the same time, we cannot deny that such a special issue, put together by a team of nondisabled scholars based in north-western Europe, and drawing directly and indirectly our established networks, remains, in John Gaventa's (2020: 118f) terminology, an 'invited space' shaped by hidden and invisible forms of power, offering selected entry points for influence and change. Nonetheless, we are content that this collection represents a much-needed starting point for mainstreaming and deepening the engagement with disability inclusive employment in international development. In this editorial, we first lay out some foundational concepts and issues that are relevant to all the individual papers, which may be helpful orientation for readers who are new to the disability field especially as knowledge of these is assumed in some of the papers. Subsequently, we explore some of the similarities across the papers and explain how the discussions overlap and complement each other. This highlights the key features of the current disability inclusive (or often exclusionary) employment landscape. Firstly, a note about language use in this special Issue: terminology in the disability field is highly contested. In many parts of the world, including in much of Asia and Africa, 'person first' language is preferred, thus 'person with disabilities', 'women with disabilities' and so on. This is in line with the UN system and particularly the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD, 2006). However, some scholars and activists, particularly in the United Kingdom, United States and elsewhere, including the editorial team here, prefer 'disabled people', 'disabled women' and so on. This is because it echoes the ethos of the 'social model of disability',2 the current dominant theoretical paradigm in disability discourses (Shakespeare, 2013). Therefore, in this set of papers both usages will be found, some authors choosing to alternate between them, others preferring one or the other. People with disabilities have been estimated to make up roughly 15% of the global population (WHO and World Bank, 2011), although this figure is currently being refined and may be revised downwards to around 10% in most contexts (Mont, 2019). Disability is defined as the outcome of a combination of a person's health condition, their impairments (e.g., physical, sensory including visual and hearing, intellectual and psychosocial), the environment and the response of society to these differences (UN, 2006). Thus, the level of difficulty someone has is partly dependent on the response of others around them. They are amongst the poorest and most disadvantaged people worldwide and substantially under-represented in formal and informal employment globally (Abidi & Sharma, 2014; Buckup, 2009; Mizunoya & Mitra, 2012; Tripney et al., 2015). Therefore, disability inclusion has become a compelling policy imperative in many countries. The phrase 'disability inclusive development' sums up this approach which it is anticipated will in time be operationalised globally and in a wide range of situations and across all sectors of activity (such as livelihoods promotion). Disability activists and allies envision a time when the inclusion of people with disabilities in all human activities will be the norm, not the exception. Then inclusion will be part of everyday life, not needing any special interventions or attention to make it happen. Disability inclusion is a relatively new idea. Although 'inclusion' as a broader concept is now commonly used in many aspirational documents across development discourses, disability inclusion needs specific explanation and intentional attention. It appeared first in relation to education (i.e., Inclusive Education) nearly three decades ago, promoting the idea that disabled children have a right to be educated alongside their nondisabled peers rather in segregated institutions such as special schools. The inclusion movement has accelerated and broadened over time, with a considerable surge of awareness, success and spread globally, and especially since the launching of the ground-breaking UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) (UN, 2006). This treaty underlined the importance of an inclusive approach across sectors, so concepts such as 'inclusive health' and 'inclusive employment' are now gaining traction in many contexts, at least in theory. Segregated services and activities are now seen as exclusionary, limiting disabled people's opportunities and contrary to the UNCRPD. Disability was largely absent in the Millennium Development Goals agenda, but the movement towards disability inclusive societies was further bolstered by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015), which contain multiple mentions of the concept across 17 goals. In the SDGs, however, inclusion has a broader usage, promoting the idea of equity for all marginalised and disempowered groups, not just in relation to disability. In the SDG era, the term has also increasingly featured in framings which questionably fuse social inclusion agendas with market- and business-led development strategies, such as 'inclusive growth', 'inclusive markets', 'inclusive business', 'inclusive capitalism' and 'financial inclusion' (Baron et al., 2019: 15-16; Mader & Morvant-Roux, 2019). Understandings about what disability inclusion specifically means or really entails in practice, and how to address intractable blockages, lags behind the global treaties and goals. Good intentions at policy level do not yet transfer effectively into implementation in context. This means interventions can often be tokenistic, leading to the treaties and laws being seen as impotent. Across all the sectors, including employment, it is more difficult than it first appears to achieve real equity and disability inclusion. Inclusion entails mainstream entities, such as employers, shifting their intentions and practice towards a positive view of difference and diversity and ensuring that applicants and, subsequently, employees with disabilities are welcomed. They need to be provided with the support they need to get jobs, to work comfortably alongside other employees, to feel respected, supported and able to contribute and progress in the workplace. Adaptations required by people with disabilities (such as physical or communication changes in the environment) are called 'reasonable accommodations'. These must be complemented by changes in attitudes towards people with disabilities (Saleh & Bruyere, 2018). As well as the more obvious visible adaptations such as ramps, accessible bathrooms, sign language interpretation, braille and specific software, there are more subtle and 'invisible' changes in the environment and behaviour of others that may be needed to enable someone to feel fully included in the workplace. Disability rights: A shift in thinking about disability happened/began with the emergence of the 'social model' of disability, which went through various iterations over the last 20–30 years (Thomas, 2004). This approach contrasts with the previous 'medical and individual' models, which assume that disability is a personal and often health-related matter, not a concern of society more widely. More lately, these ideas have evolved into a 'human rights' model. This reconceptualization of disability and suggestions for action, placed a strong emphasis on individuals' right to autonomy and independence (e.g., the independent living movement in the United States) and importantly societies' responsibilities to adapt to include everyone. The UN Convention (UN, 2006) epitomised and cemented this shift and following its launch and promulgation there has been plenty of theoretical aspiration for equity and realisation of rights in many of the 180+ states that have so far signed up to it. People are supposed to have a right to choose the kind of lives they lead and to equal access to all the key ingredients for a good life and positive wellbeing: health, education, livelihoods/work, social and political life and so on. The responsibility to ensure that these rights are accessible to all lies with society as a whole but is enacted through specific duty bearers such as state actors. Differences between people are then regarded as incidental, their difference from a supposed 'norm' accepted as part of human diversity and perhaps celebrated, rather than as a matter of embarrassment, exclusion and discrimination (Cameron, 2014). This shift towards 'people focused' approaches mirrors debates in development studies around autonomy, resonating strongly with Sen's (1999) ideas on framing development as 'freedom'. The right to make and be involved in choices and to have freedom of opportunity are relevant themes to both. Importantly, the UNCRPD also outlines a specific role for OPD in promoting rights, as advocating for and monitoring progress towards inclusion and policy influencing. Uniquely, the treaty has mandated these groups of representatives of disabled people to be much more active and powerful than they previously were, and this has shifted at least to some extent the activities OPDs do from mutual support and local advocacy towards project planning and management, evaluation and high-level representation. This has not been without its tensions (Myers, 2016). Financial autonomy: Historically then, until the start of the 21st century, images and expectations of disabled people were predominantly as people who were likely to be net beneficiaries of support, usually in a charitable form, rather than net contributors who could participate socially and contribute financially to society and be autonomous. Of course, there have been some notable exceptions, and these tend to be individuals from elite backgrounds, who have substantial social capital through education and or family connections. They are also often those with impairments that are less marginalised (e.g., physical or visual impairments rather than more stigmatised cognitive, communication and psychosocial difficulties). Disabled people may often be viewed as the 'deserving poor' (they cannot help being poor, and hence are deserving of help), who can expect to be cared for, thus instigating charity models of support (from the state or others). These responses do provide for the person's material needs but leave them in a diminished position and dependent on others. They are judged by others to lack the skills to be autonomous, especially as workers, which, especially in societies that rely heavily on market exchange for provisioning, risks consigning them to partial citizenship and continued lack of access to work, especially more formal employment (Roulstone, 2012). If excluded from employment, their value as citizens may be further reduced, in a vicious cycle. This exclusion might be particularly true in societies where personhood (status as a person and citizenship) is linked to people's financial contribution to their households and, perhaps more importantly, to the state through paying tax. Thus, if people perceived as disabled are not given equal access to employment, they remain disempowered and marginalised, and easily regarded as of little worth in society. A steep power gradient between disabled and nondisabled people, where the former is assumed to be dependent on the latter is perpetuated. The UNCRPD aspires to break this deadlock, but such negative and exclusionary attitudes and expectations remain very embedded in many cultural contexts and form a large but invisible mass below the waterline of (what we may call) the inclusion iceberg. Above the waterline is a small peak of progress and positive practice, underneath is a complex mass of misunderstandings and blocks that are unseen and uncontested. The seven papers included here address dilemmas within the disability inclusive employment arena from various angles and in diverse cultural and socio-political contexts. Some have a multi-country focus (e.g., Bialik & Mhiri, 2022; Morris et al., 2022; Shaw et al., 2022) while others discuss individual countries and situations (Ebuenyi et al., 2022: Kenya; Nkansah-Dwamena, 2022: Ghana; Remnant et al., 2022: Malawi; Yusupov & Abdukhalilov, 2022: Uzbekistan). The special issue was planned, and the call for papers launched during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was important to include at least one paper about the economic impacts of the pandemic on a particular population (Ebuenyi et al., 2022). Other papers also discuss the pandemic as some of their data were collected during the acute period of the crisis. We have more contributions that draw on experience in Africa than elsewhere, although this was not intentional. We recognise that disability inclusive employment is an issue relevant to all countries and regions. Disability inclusive employment is clearly a topic that needs exploration, evidence, analysis and action across various levels, from micro (individual people's experiences), meso (locally in the community) through to macro (global and state policies and provisions). These different aspects are often considered in isolation, when we feel what is needed is a more comprehensive and 'cross level' reflection, where the influences and connections on and between the levels are recognised and acted upon/addressed. This perspective is offered by Shaw et al. (2022). The other papers in this collection discuss the tricky problem of achieving inclusive employment from different standpoints and focus on various parts of the issue landscape. However, it is clear that when considering a complex problem, no single intervention will do the job alone. Thus, an overarching and system-focussed approach which considers all of these aspects will be needed, if change is to take place and be felt by substantial numbers of individual people with disabilities who are trying to get decent work, stay employed and move out of poverty. It should be noted that although many of the papers do use the commonly accepted and rather flexible definition of disability used in the UNCRPD, some do not and use other definitions, which have a more individual/medical flavour. We have left these as written, to illustrate that the concept of disability is still in flux in relation to the way it is understood in different contexts and within different disciplinary backgrounds. Some of the papers provide overviews of these definitions, the models they are informed by and why these are relevant to particular contexts or arguments (e.g., Nkansah-Dwamena, 2022). There are some recurring themes and issues raised by several or all the papers. They use a range of methodologies but are mainly empirical qualitative studies, some with a strong participatory/co-construction or action research element and or linked to larger intervention programmes (Bialik & Mhiri, 2022; Morris et al., 2022; Shaw et al., 2022). This is appropriate for the topic, as it brings an inclusive action-orientated feel to the evidence collection processes and interpretation. Other papers focus on law and policy review and barrier analysis (Yusupov & Abdukhalilov, 2022). Many authors emphasise the need for research about disability related topics to reconsider seriously the way the kinds of reasonable accommodations are provided for participants (i.e., inclusive practice), in order to ensure genuinely meaningful participation of people with a range of impairments, based on involving, hearing and responding to the concerns of real people. Some papers have a specific gender or impairment focus, and this is important, as we know that rates of unemployment are much higher everywhere for women with disabilities than for men, and also that some impairment groups are particularly excluded from the jobs market. All the papers except Bialik and Mhiri (2022) and Nkansah-Dwamena (2022) address the inclusive employment agenda for a range of people with varied impairment types. The former authors focus on people with intellectual disabilities specifically, and we were glad to include this paper with its very participatory and inclusive approach, as this group is usually excluded from research and disability debates. Nkansah-Dwamena (2022) addresses the concerns of women with mental health impairments. Many of the papers reference the importance of the global treaties, the involvement of international bodies such as ILO (2015) (and, linked to them, the Global Business Disability Network) and the overarching disability representative organisations such as IDA (International Disability Alliance). The relationships between these and the national and local bodies such as national disability umbrella organisations are not addressed specifically by any of the papers, and this is something that perhaps needs further investigation. Many of the papers mention the implementation gap between governments signing the UNCRPD, producing their own national laws and policies on disability rights, and what happens in practice. This is a recurring theme throughout the wider body of disability literature globally. It is accepted widely that disabled people are very often economically vulnerable, and they are disproportionately represented amongst the poor. The mechanisms driving this are thought to be that it is harder to get a job and keep it for disabled people and also reduced access to finance, extra expenses, reduced social capital, less community support and more stigma to deal with. Increased risk of job loss for people with disabilities during economic downturns and other crises (e.g., as an impact of a pandemic) is mentioned by several of the papers (Bialik & Mhiri, 2022; Ebuenyi et al., 2022). Taking an intersectional view, we can see the overlapping inequalities that disabled people face. They are already in precarious economic positions and are vulnerable to catastrophic expenditures and losses of income, as their work (if they can get it) is often in the informal sector and without long-term security and typically not protected by employment laws. Some of papers report on research linked to intervention programmes working on disability inclusive employment and thus provide recommendations for programme planners and for policy level action (Bialik & Mhiri, 2022; Ebuenyi et al., 2022; Morris et al., 2022; Remnant et al., 2022; Shaw et al., 2022; Yusupov & Abdukhalilov, 2022). There are clear overlaps and synchronies in what they say. Some emphasise the removal of barriers that will benefit people with all types of impairment (and other people), while others focus on making gender, impairment or context specific suggestions or addressing issues at specific levels (i.e., individual, community and structural). Reading across the papers, a key message is that instrumental types of intervention such as policy and practice guidelines, provision of assistive devices and soft skills training for jobseekers with disabilities are necessary but not sufficient to bring about wholesale change towards disability inclusive employment. At the individual level, a call for the promotion of really effective capacity building for self-advocacy, empowerment and self-determination as well as very targeted skill building that matches market needs, rather than ill-fitting generic vocational training approaches, echoes across multiple papers (e.g., Bialik & Mhiri, 2022; Remnant et al., 2022; Shaw et al., 2022). Looking beyond disabled people themselves, training and practical advice on disability awareness, fundamental attitude change towards a culture of acceptance of difference and understanding rights arguments is crucial for community actors and employers, who have often had little exposure to these ideas (Nkansah-Dwamena, 2022). The UNCRPD (article 27) is widely cited in the papers, but some problematise the way it is actually enacted, as often limited by common assumptions made by duty bearers such as employers about what is possible. Often there remains a medical or charity model 'feel' to their approaches (Remnant et al., 2022). Employing disabled people is still regularly seen as economically risky compared to employing nondisabled people, with extra costs and lower productivity being expected. Governments are of course potential employers as well as policy-makers, and this is sometimes mentioned, although more of the focus is on private sector employment. There is clearly a need for increased efforts by governments as employers to lead the way in being inclusive (Nkansah-Dwamena, 2022). Other key actors of importance include trade unions. The paper by Remnant et al. (2022) is unique in being based on partnership with these (in Malawi) and looking at their role and perspectives. In relation to the benefits of inclusive employment for employers versus for disabled people themselves, more has been said about the latter than the former. Research on the former also more often addresses current rather than prospective employers' perspectives and is more likely to be undertaken in high-income countries than middle- or low-income regions. This imbalance is corrected to some extent by this set of papers, as employees in Asia and Africa's views are represented widely in the special issue. The role of civil society actors such as local OPDs and their national umbrella bodies, as key stakeholders in promoting inclusive employment is discussed in several of the papers. The OPDs' relationship with both governments and NGOs (national and international) is shifting. OPDs' willingness and capacity to take on more formal evaluation, advocacy and training roles and the exact nature of the way they represent their constituents is dissected in some of the papers (e.g., Bialik & Mhiri, 2022; Remnant et al., 2022; Shaw et al., 2022). Inclusion of disabled people in policymaking through the involvement of their representatives is important in order to ensure that they are part of decision-making, but the way that this is operationalised is still evolving. It necessitates some changes in understanding amongst the other actors involved in policymaking. Thus, employers, governments and others need to become used to talking to disabled people in leadership positions. The expectation that disabled people should be able to exercise an element of job choice and expect promotion, training and career progression once in a job, rather than just being given any job, comes up regularly. That disabled people have as finely tuned career aspirations and employment goals as others is something that is only now becoming recognised. Being able to choose a career trajectory is still unavailable to many (Shaw et al., 2022). Another element of choice for disabled jobseekers is around the pros and cons of informal versus formal employment, and this dichotomy arises strongly in the studies. Often, there is an expressed preference for self-employment and development of one's own business as opposed to being employed either in large or small business or in government jobs. This is not uniform and the assumptions and policy implications of the fact that the majority of people work in the informal sector are discussed. The underlying reasons for the preference for informal work are not always clear. They may be disability related, or a result of people's experience of or expectation of discriminatory treatment at work, or part of a broader aspiration to be 'one's own boss' in some cultural contexts. The current switch to digital and remote forms of work (during and post the pandemic) has variable advantages and disadvantages for disabled people and is addressed by Morris et al. (2022). Working remotely can provide added and equal opportunities for some where online accessibility is available and for some types of work, but it does not remove discrimination and level the playing field for all. Safeguarding and protection against various forms of abuse and bullying of disabled applicants or employees in the workplace arises as a key issue, as well as more insidious or less easily recognised forms of othering. This links with dilemmas around the conceptualisation of people with disabilities as being vulnerable as a group. Clearly, given increased risks of negative treatment, they are at greater risk than others, but at the same time, there is a general dislike by many of being seen as vulnerable and sometimes a desire to counteract this by masking or not revealing having an impairment. This apparent dilemma for employers needing to address people's access needs more openly and also treat them equally and without fuss is perhaps confusing and difficult to navigate for those who are new to the disability inclusion arena. At the structural, macro level, several of the papers suggest the need for a 'bird's eye view' of the inclusive employment landscape. Interventions at the individual and community level need to be complemented and linked to transformational change at the organisational, local and national government levels. An intentional and deliberate effort is required to recognise the need for implementation of policies. There need to be challenges to discrimination and rights abuses, and wholesale shifts in attitudes at all levels, so that disabled people really do experience equality of opportunities. Both Nkansah-Dwamena (2022) and Shaw et al. (2022) argue for change at this macro level and for more linkages and communication between levels of action. Most of the papers, unsurprisingly, conclude that more research is needed on disability more broadly, both quantitative and qualitative, and including participatory and inclusive methodologies, in order to address the policy-practice implementation gap, as well as on specific aspects such as exploring the experiences and perspectives of women with disabilities' and people with particular impairments (specifically those at the bottom of an exclusionary 'hierarchy of impairment').3 Attention needs to be paid not just to the different levels of action: individual, community and structural but also to the disjuncture and needs for links between them. Overall, this set of papers provides a rich and diverse set of perspectives and insights regarding the current state of play for disability inclusive employment as a global aspiration. There is plenty of nuance and detailed evidence to help the reader to understand this important but complex area of international development. We acknowledge that other work is also going on in this arena, which has not been covered in this special issue. We hope you enjoy the collection and find the papers useful in your own work, perhaps in terms of enabling you include an avowedly disability inclusive component.

Psychosocial literacy at work: The role of digital data,2023,"Abstract The burden caused by poor psychosocial working environments on the working population, organizations, societies, and economies are a major challenge to occupational health, and fair work. A key enabler for accelerating the promotion of healthy and safe workplaces is the enhancement of psychosocial health literacy at work, to support not only workers and organizations but also communities and countries to understand, recognize and take effective actions to protect and promote their own psychosocial health and sustainability. Digitalization, on the other hand has been an enabler for knowledge creation and added value to information. The present work proposes a methodology that combines digital big data on psychosocial health of the Portuguese working population (PWP), allied with quantitative and qualitive approaches to the design of psychosocial literacy at work tailored interventions. In the promotion of psychosocial safe working environments collaborative co-design models are often recognized has effective because the process undertakes meaningful engagement with workers, enlarged community, health and safety professionals and decision makers, to uncover specific wisdom and ensure tailored psychosocial work literacy interventions. Each organization is unique and undertakes its own “personality”, so individualized interventions for dealing with the organization individual psychosocial profile are the most effective way to design such interventions. The digital data from the PWP are allied with a qualitative tailored approach admitting results maximization by using digital big data and algorithm calculation for several values and cluster identification incorporating individual and organizational specificities, using the data from the Portuguese Observatory on Occupational Factors (Popsy@Work). Its intended to raise awareness on the need to democratize the access to psychosocial health at work. Key messages • Digital big data on psychosocial health monitoring, reporting and foresight, allows the promotion of robust metrics and reference values for the Portuguese working population. • Psychosocial literacy at work is potentiated by collaborative co-design models – aligning digital big data and qualitative individualized approaches.","['psychosocial', 'literacy', 'work:', 'role', 'digital', 'data']"
Auditing Communication Sinjaimo Work Culture in the New Normal Era at KPPN Sinjai,2023,"Due to the New Normal era of the industrial revolution 4.0, all sectors of society's economy and government organizations must adapt and improve to carry out digital transformation, including the Sinjai State Treasury Service Office (KPPN) through the Sinjai Mobile (SinjaiMo) innovation.A mobile-based educational application called SinjaiMo uses data, images, video lectures, and other formats to deliver regulatory information, APBN realization data, Budget Implementation Performance Indicator Values (IKPA), Distribution of Special Allocation Funds, and Village Funds.This study examines how KPPN Sinjai's management of the SinjaiMo application represents a new workplace culture.A qualitative descriptive method using a communication audit approach was used to accomplish this purpose.Interviews with SinjaiMo administrators are used as a method of collecting in-depth information.The interview findings will be compared to the observations published on the SinjaiMo app.The results of this research demonstrate that, despite several challenges, KPPN Sinjai's communication process via the SinjaiMo application complies with the guidelines for disclosing public information.The advice offered to KPPN Sinjai as a result of this research is likely to manage two-way communication to increase stakeholder involvement and the necessity of routine monitoring and evaluation.","['auditing', 'communication', 'sinjaimo', 'work', 'culture', 'normal', 'kppn', 'sinjai']"
Measures for balancing the supply and demand for work of graduates of vocational educational institutions,2024,"Based on the data of the sociological study (through a survey of employers in the Lviv region) on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the supply and demand for the work of graduates of vocational (and technical) educational institutions (hereinafter referred to as VEI), the needs of employers for qualified workers – VEI graduates are identified. There is a significant shortage of workers in the region; the level of professional training of VEI graduates is average, which requires enterprises to create conditions for additional training directly at the workplace or to give preference to specialists with work experience due to the lack of practical work skills of VEI graduates. There is a low level of cooperation between VEIs and business entities in the region or the one of a purely formal nature, which affects the degree of staffing of enterprises with workers. There is a need to establish cooperation between businesses and VEIs to harmonize the scope and structure of professions and specific professional and qualification characteristics (skills) of graduates. The main obstacles to the spread of dual education include the lack of full, including digital, communication, respectively, coordination of activities between VEIs and businesses in these matters, as well as the unwillingness of businesses to spend time and resources on this. The article substantiates that effective tools for balancing supply and demand for the work of VEI graduates include the development of partnerships with businesses, involvement of employers in the learning process, establishment of an effective dialogue with VEIs; creation of appropriate conditions for practical training, provision of workplaces and laboratories with modern equipment and technologies; introduction of monitoring of the quality of vocational education; formation of regional orders for the training of specialists in VEIs based on the results of longitudinal studies of the state and trends in the development of the labor market, foresight of structural indicators of the employment sector.","['measures', 'balancing', 'supply', 'demand', 'work', 'graduates', 'vocational', 'educational', 'institutions']"
The concept of “Stalking” and its relevance to the existing phenomena of internet and social media,2019,"Definition and Concept Stalking has been variously defined by researchers and legal systems around the world. Generally, two accepted elements of stalking are (i) repetitive conduct by the perpetrator that (ii) induces a concern of harm to self in the victim.[1] The conduct of the perpetrator can involve various methods (tactics) and patterns of use. Well-known tactics include surveillance (follow, watch, wait, etc.), life invasion (calling up, messaging, entering premises, bothering acquaintances of victim, etc.), intimidation (implicit or explicit threats to victim and their close ones, damage to property, etc.), and attack (ruining reputation, road rage, sexual assault, etc.). The pattern of stalking can be elaborated by the duration of stalking, intensity (number of different tactics and locations the stalker employs), and its frequency. Stalkers often deceive the victim's family and friends to divulge information of the victim as a part of their surveillance strategy (proxy stalking). The awareness of being under surveillance generates anxiety in the victim, thereby stalkers can pose a threat without even uttering a word.[2] Studies have shown that anxiety experienced by the victims is significantly correlated with surveillance, pursuit, and threat tactics used by the stalker.[3] Stalking can involve public humiliation, interference at work, and leisure activities (life sabotage) and on many occasions can involve the victims' family members, friends, and colleagues (collateral victims). Victims can feel incapable, inadequate, and frustrated.[4] Nearly 30%–60% of stalking victims have reported threat of assault by the stalker, while lesser number of victims have reported actual assault.[5] However, it also needs to be kept in perspective that about 2% of the victims may not actually have been stalked (false victimization syndrome).[5] Classification Mullen et al. classified and validated a clinically oriented stalker classification system for risk assessment and management interventions.[6] Under this classification, rejected stalkers are those who pursue the victim, usually a former partner, after the end of their relationship. The stalker harbors admixture of feelings (reconciliation and revenge) toward the victim and is more likely to assault. Intimacy-seeking stalkers believe that their relationship with the victim is in essence ""true love"" and are more likely to have erotomanic delusions. They are unaffected by legal sanctions and need psychiatric treatment. Incompetent stalkers are aware of the victim being disinterested in them, but have hopes that their behavior will eventually lead to a relationship. Resentful stalkers intend to frighten the victim as they feel that they have been wrongly aggrieved by them. People who suffer with paranoid personality or delusional disorders are frequently associated with this type. Predatory stalkers prepare for a sexual assault and are likely to suffer from paraphilias. Other alternative classifications/typology of stalking behavior that have been reported are Holmes typology and Sheridan and Boon typology.[78] These typologies are based on the stalkers' (1) intent on forging a new relationship, (2) intent to harass or punish, and (3) motivation for power and control. Up to half of those indulging in stalking have some mental disorder, with substance use disorder and cluster A personalities being common.[5] Etiology Attempts to explain stalking behavior by dysfunction attachment (anxious/ambivalent attachment styles) and neurobiological dysfunction (increased CNS dopamine activity combined with reduced serotonin activity) have also been reported. Special Circumstances The 2013 amendment of code of criminal procedures also introduced acid attack on women under Section 326 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). It is often reported in media that the acid attack victim had been frequently approached by the perpetrator and his/her advances were snubbed by the victim, which clearly indicated stalking. Recently, Government of India amended the Rights of Persons with Disability Act (2016) to include victims of acid attacks, thus providing them an opportunity for education and employment under affirmative action for disablement. Internet and Stalking: the Relationship As individual members of human society, we flourish when we connect to others in closed supportive relationships.[9] The increasing affordability of internet and its availability on multitude of devices like computers, mobiles, laptops, tablets etc., provides continuous means to be in touch with people in general, and supportive relationships in particular. Internet usage, by presence of its social media sites in particular, provides avenues for self-disclosure which in turn helps develop relationships that are based on common interests and values.[9] However, the internet also allows for anonymity which can be used for bullying, sexual exploitation, and spreading unverified information. Stalking behavior has thus now moved to the virtual space. The term cyberstalking should not be simply understood as merely information-seeking behavior on social media (Facebook/friend stalking) but repeated pursuit of an individual over the internet.[10] Researchers have also conceptualized technology-facilitated sexual violence as a ""range of criminal, civil, or otherwise harmful sexually aggressive behaviours that are perpetuated with the aid or use of communication technologies.""[11] Cyberstalking is different from offline or physical stalking for a number of reasons. First, anonymity can be fairly maintained by the stalker until cyber experts or legal agencies are involved. Second, cyberstalking may not necessarily involve physical proximity of the victim and stalker. The victim may not be aware of being under surveillance while simultaneously being vulnerable in their ""own"" cyberspace. Third, and conversely, unlike in most cases of physical stalking where the victim and stalker may have known each other, cyberstalking victims are unlikely to know their stalkers. Fourth, cyberstalkers are more likely to not have any criminal record, which indicates that the anonymity offered by internet creates an opportunity to pursue deviant behaviors.[10] Cyberstalking behavior has been classified as hyper-intimacy, threat, sabotage, and invasion type based upon its severity.[12] Hyper-intimacy type involves affection expression (repeated messages of a desired relationship, despite being rebuffed), ingratiation (sending unsolicited messages of assistance, or compliments), and/or hypersexual communications (sending graphic sexual content). Threats include implicit or explicit harm intended on person's reputation by real or falsified information, and also threats of physical harm to the person, their close ones, or their property. Sabotage involves attack on the person's character by spreading rumors or gossips to their colleagues, friends, or family. Invasion involves access to victims' device via spyware or other means, which enables stalkers' complete access to the victims' digital activities. Consequences The distress perceived by victims of cyberstalking is similar to that experienced by those from physical stalking.[13] These include social withdrawal, disturbances in sleep pattern, and changes in social habits.[1415] Paradoxically, the cyberstalker perceives themselves to be emotionally closer to their victims than that would be expected from the physical stalker.[16] Management strategies Strategies used by victims have also been studied, albeit not extensively. In offline stalking, strategies have been categorized as the following, viz., informal coping (seeking help and advice from family, friends, and colleagues), relocation coping (moving to a new place of residence, school, or workplace), interactional coping (confronting the stalker), and formal coping (lodging complaint with police).[17] In a study among victims of cyberstalking, strategies used include ignoring/avoidance, active technological dissociation, help-seeking, negotiating or threatening the pursuer, making false excuses, changing and upgrading accounts, and counter-attacking the stalker.[10] The trauma experienced by the victim best correlates to the number of coping responses the victim has to employ.[3] Legal implications Arrest rates, prosecution, and conviction rates for stalking are relatively low in contrast to reported high prevalence of stalking.[4] This may be because the justice systems focus more on physical harm to the victim rather than psychological distress associated with stalking. Recently, India amended Section 344 of IPC, wherein Section 354-D states that any man who (i) follows a woman and contacts or attempts to contact such woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman or (ii) monitors the use by a woman of the internet, e-mail, or any other form of electronic communication commits the offence of stalking. This amendment covers for physical stalking and cyberstalking. It allows exception when such an act is pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or pursued after due process of any law. First-time offenders can be punished up to a maximum of 3 years with/without fine and subsequent offense(s) can be punished for up to maximum 5 years with/without fine. In a statement by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, 7132 cases of stalking were registered in 2016 for which 8620 arrests were made and 481 persons were convicted. Cumulative for the years 2014–2016, 18,097 cases were registered, 20,743 arrests were made, and 1216 convicted, giving a conviction rate of <7%.[18] Section 354-D has been criticized for not being gender neutral, perpetrator being male and victim being female. There are also other provisions in India that can be applied in cases of stalking and cyberstalking. Section 507 of IPC recognizes criminal intimidation by anonymous communication as a crime, while Section 509 of IPC recognizes ""words, gestures or act intended to insult the modesty of women"" as crime. The Information Technology Act, 2000, Section 67 defines publishing any obscene content or posting such content in electronic form as a crime. Further, the Act is gender neutral and provides much harsher punishment. Conclusions Stalking is an extremely unpleasant experience (the senior author can affirm it from his personal experience).[19] Cyberstalking can be even more unpleasant with high degree of psychosocial and psychological consequences. Education can be useful for perpetrators/pursuers, especially for pursuers who may not recognize that their behavior is upsetting to their targets. There is a need for increased vigilance in policing online social platforms, such as WhatsApp, Tinder, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, to identify incidents of cyberstalking and to provide greater safety for potential/actual targets online. We live in a rapidly expanding and burgeoning era of technological advances coupled with anonymity and paranoia (leading onto heightening surveillance) due to which potential opportunities for unwanted pursuing are greater. Nevertheless, with appropriate, legal, political, and social will and desire, such undesirable behavior can be curbed. As mental health professionals, we need to be able to contribute in greater ways by understanding the psychosocial aspects related to the potential victims and perpetrators, the acts, and the consequences so that one can find better solutions and potentially curb and/or eradicate this ever-growing menace.

La Ley Orgánica 3/2018 como marco embrionario de garantía de los derechos digitales laborales. Claves para un análisis sistemático,2019,"espanolLa Ley Organica 3/2018, de Proteccion de Datos Personales y Garantia de los Derechos digitales ha venido a formular, en el marco de su Titulo X, una regulacion embrionaria de las garantias digitales de los trabajadores, a partir del mandato del RGPD de adaptar la normativa general de proteccion de datos al entorno laboral. Pese a su regulacion minimalista, se erige, no obstante a la normativa de proteccion de datos en su conjunto en referencia ineludible de gran relevancia en punto al establecimiento de limites al ejercicio de los poderes empresariales de supervision laboral. Partiendo de dicha premisa, se regulan algunos de los escenarios social y jurisprudencialmente tipicos en los que dicho ejercicio conlleva tratamientos de datos personales de los trabajadores, otorgandose a estos derechos de privacidad en relacion con el uso de dispositivos digitales, la videovigilancia y captacion de sonidos y la geolocalizacion.

A Conceptual Model for Integrating Ergonomics and Health Surveillance to Reduce Occupational Illnesses in the Nigerian Manufacturing Sector,2024,"The Nigerian manufacturing sector is pivotal to the nation’s economic development but remains plagued by a high prevalence of occupational illnesses, which are exacerbated by poor ergonomics and inadequate health surveillance systems. This study proposes a conceptual model for integrating ergonomics and health surveillance to mitigate occupational illnesses, improve workplace safety, and enhance employee productivity. The model emphasizes the synergy between ergonomic interventions and health surveillance strategies to identify, monitor, and address risk factors contributing to work-related illnesses. The proposed framework comprises three core components: ergonomic risk assessment, real-time health surveillance, and intervention management. Ergonomic risk assessment involves evaluating workplace conditions, tasks, and tools to identify physical and cognitive stressors that compromise workers' health. Real-time health surveillance integrates digital technologies, such as wearable devices and IoT-enabled sensors, to monitor physiological and environmental parameters, providing early detection of potential health risks. Intervention management utilizes data-driven decision-making to implement targeted ergonomic and medical interventions, supported by periodic training and stakeholder engagement to sustain long-term improvements. The model also highlights the role of regulatory frameworks and organizational policies in creating an enabling environment for its adoption. A multi-disciplinary approach involving industrial engineers, occupational health professionals, and policymakers is proposed to facilitate seamless implementation. This integration ensures a holistic response to occupational health challenges, bridging the gap between ergonomics and health surveillance practices. Preliminary application of the conceptual model through case studies in selected Nigerian manufacturing companies has demonstrated its potential to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory conditions, and stress-induced illnesses. Moreover, the framework promotes employee well-being and operational efficiency, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8, which advocates for decent work and economic growth. The findings from this study provide a foundation for developing industry-specific guidelines and national policies that prioritize ergonomics and health surveillance. Future research will explore scalability and adaptability to other sectors.","['conceptual', 'model', 'integrating', 'ergonomics', 'health', 'surveillance', 'reduce', 'occupational', 'illnesses', 'nigerian', 'manufacturing', 'sector']"
Employees’ right to data protection reflecting their activities in the internet,2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made working from home in Vietnam become popular than ever. With the development of digital technology, employees can now work from home without going to the workplace. In addition, employers can perform their management and supervision rights by using remote monitoring software such as ActivTrak or HubStaff. According to a survey by TechRepublic and ExpressVPN, 78% of 2000 users responded that they use software to track employee activities. The result raises the question of whether the employee's right to protect personal data has been put under the management of the employer? Within the scope of this article, the author focuses on analyzing one of the contents of Personal data, which is data that reflects employees' activities or history of internet activities. It should be noted that labour relations are built on both trust and material elements. Therefore, ensuring the development of a healthy labour relationship will create a driving force for the development of the economy. Along with the global integration trend, this is likely to be an essential issue in the labour relationship because workers are more aware of the protection of data reflecting activities on the internet while performing their assigned tasks. In the context that Vietnam is increasingly integrating into globalization and gradually adapting to the 4.0 economy, the author believes that the right to data protection reflecting employee activities on the internet needs to be not only specifically recognized in the labour law but also gone along with the right to manage and supervise the use of the internet of the employer.","['employees’', 'right', 'data', 'protection', 'reflecting', 'their', 'activities', 'internet']"
EDITORIAL,2015,"This issue of the Journal of Healthcare Management is evidence that the United States, with its diverse groups of individuals engaged in healthcare, is experiencing dramatic changes in attitudes and culture. At the micro level, these changes can fuel technologically empowered care teams to rapidly innovate and test new and better ways of delivering healthcare. We are experiencing a time of transformation and growing pains in the healthcare sector. Our interview provides a lesson about advocacy, leadership, and how to embrace change even when it is difficult to determine the future of your hospital and the healthcare sector. Richard J. Umbdenstock, FACHE, president of the American Hospital Association, shares insights from his many years as a servant leader. He describes characteristics of tomorrow's healthcare executive, who will have to take on more risk and understand the cost-benefit equation for every decision. In this issue's Operations and Strategy column, John S. Toussaint, MD, describes how management systems can help empower care teams to change and innovate, and he describes the hospital setting as a rapid adaptability system. Our Population Health columnist is David B. Nash, MD, who examines the changing culture among U.S. employers and emerging attitudes toward employee health that go beyond workplace safety. Dr. Nash also offers practical recommendations to achieve nondiscrimination compliance under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) when implementing workplace wellness programs. Data-driven decision making has clearly infiltrated healthcare. Jack Weiner, PharmD, FACHE, et al. illustrate how strategy and operations can be enhanced through the use of appropriate digital dashboard data. The authors present a case study of St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan. The patient experience is a key performance indicator that affects Medicare payment. Olena Mazurenko, MD, PhD, et al. conduct a qualitative study to gain a better understanding of the surgical patient experience from the patient's perspective and that of family members, physicians, nurses, and managers. Patient and healthcare worker perceptions of quality and safety are important when hospital administrators are considering adoption of hand hygiene monitoring technologies. Maryanne McGuckin, DrScEd, and John Govednik provide a comprehensive review of published studies evaluating hand hygiene monitoring systems. They suggest that healthcare workers and patients may not view these systems as positively as healthcare managers view them. Finally, how can the patient experience be improved in an outpatient specialty setting? Rafael Miranda et al. address this question by examining a hybrid change strategy implemented at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. Healthcare administrators who operate outpatient specialty clinics can learn valuable lessons from this experience. The authors find that reducing the burden of clerical tasks on the specialist while improving his or her previsit knowledge about the patient is key to overall success. Achieving this begins with preappointment telephone calls that launch the appointment process and the patient experience. Bita A.

Validation of computer vision-based ergonomic risk assessment tools for real manufacturing environments,2024,"This study contributes to understanding semi-automated ergonomic risk assessments in industrial manufacturing environments, proposing a practical tool for enhancing worker safety and operational efficiency. In the Industry 5.0 era, the human-centric approach in manufacturing is crucial, especially considering the aging workforce and the dynamic nature of the entire modern industrial sector, today integrating digital technology, automation, and sustainable practices to enhance productivity and environmental responsibility. This approach aims to adapt work conditions to individual capabilities, addressing the high incidence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The traditional, subjective methods of ergonomic assessment are inadequate for dynamic settings, highlighting the need for affordable, automatic tools for continuous monitoring of workers' postures to evaluate ergonomic risks effectively during tasks. To enable this perspective, 2D RGB Motion Capture (MoCap) systems based on computer vision currently seem the technologies of choice, given their low intrusiveness, cost, and implementation effort. However, the reliability and applicability of these systems in the dynamic and varied manufacturing environment remain uncertain. This research benchmarks various literature proposed MoCap tools and examines the viability of MoCap systems for ergonomic risk assessments in Industry 5.0 by exploiting one of the benchmarked semi-automated, low-cost and non-intrusive 2D RGB MoCap system, capable of continuously monitoring and analysing workers' postures. By conducting experiments across varied manufacturing environments, this research evaluates the system's effectiveness in assessing ergonomic risks and its adaptability to different production lines. Results reveal that the accuracy of risk assessments varies by specific environmental conditions and workstation setups. Although these systems are not yet optimized for expert-level risk certification, they offer significant potential for enhancing workplace safety and efficiency by providing continuous posture monitoring. Future improvements could explore advanced computational techniques like machine learning to refine ergonomic assessments further.","['validation', 'computer', 'vision-based', 'ergonomic', 'risk', 'assessment', 'tools', 'real', 'manufacturing', 'environments']"
"Advancing Construction Practices: Innovations, Efficiency, and Safety in The Digital Era",2024,"In the ever-changing landscape of the construction industry, digital tools and procedures are a cornerstone of architectural and engineering practices. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and other computational design methodologies transform how projects are imagined, planned, and executed. These tools improve design precision while allowing real-time collaboration across different teams. As a result, adopting digital approaches is no longer an option but rather a requirement for remaining competitive in the construction industry. These innovative approaches provide an in-depth understanding of project complexities, drive design optimization, and contribute to resource management efficiency. Construction efficiency has also improved due to lean manufacturing processes and process optimization techniques. These approaches emphasize waste reduction, improved workflows, and increased productivity, which are critical to meeting project timelines and budgets. In this age of technology, combining lean methods with advanced software tools empowers project teams by allowing them to accomplish more with less effort and cultivating a culture of continuous improvement. By combining traditional lean strategies with current digital tools, the construction industry is setting new benchmarks for operational efficiency. Safety and stakeholder involvement are other important factors that benefit greatly from technology improvements in the construction industry. Enhanced safety measures, backed by digital technology, ensure that safety practices are strictly followed and monitored. Furthermore, digital platforms boost stakeholder engagement by giving all parties—from project managers and workers to investors and clients—access to real-time data and analytics. This transparency not only builds confidence but also guarantees that everyone engaged is aware of safety requirements and the progress of the project. This collaborative environment is critical for detecting potential risks early on and encouraging a proactive attitude to workplace safety. In addition to technological and methodological developments, the construction industry is becoming more focused on resilience and sustainability. Climate change and environmental sustainability require construction approaches that not only reduce environmental effects but also assure infrastructure resilience when unforeseen events occur. Sustainable practices are being integrated into project lifecycles to reduce carbon footprints, increase energy efficiency, and use environmentally friendly materials. Digital tools are critical in this effort, from optimizing resource consumption to allowing for the simulation of environmental implications during the design stage.","['advancing', 'construction', 'practices:', 'innovations,', 'efficiency,', 'safety', 'digital']"
"EXPLORING SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN OF OCCUPANCY ANALYSIS, POE, AND DT IN AECO INDUSTRY: A SCIENTOMETRIC APPROACH",2023,"Building occupancy patterns strongly influence organizational effectiveness during the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) phase.

Digital Public Health Marketing of Physical Activity and Its Effect on Wellbeing in Saudi Arabia,2023,"Developing countries experienced insufficient levels of physical activity, particularly Saudi Arabia. In recent decades, Saudi Arabia has been experiencing a significant change in economy, urbanization, modernization, extensive and rapid demographic changes, and lifestyle transformation. These changes had negatively increased sedentary behaviors, inactivity physical activity, and lifestyle. Physical inactivity increases the risk of non-communicable and disease chronic diseases. Objectives: To highlight the gap in information such as gender inequality, cultural sensitivity, and social norms, including geography. Methods: Saudi Digital library, Google scholar, and UOW library. The terms used are “physical activity”, and “exercise” and research strategy were also adopted. Results: The recent Household Sports Practice Survey Bulletin in 2019 showed significant inequality between males and females. Also, the data showed different results relative to school type and gender. There are specific socio-cultural factors that limit women to participate in physical activities. Females have a low rate of total labor participants in the country. Geographical factors should be considered when establishing a promotion plan for physical activity, and there are no studies that focus on the effect of climate on participation in physical activity. Conclusion: The Saudi country has commenced numerous initiatives to improve people's health and well-being, and hopes to achieve this by 2030. It is important to build a community health center for females because there is a segregation policy to separate males from females in public places and workplaces. Having a national policy or promotion plan and collaborating with government parties is important. In addition, monitoring and evaluating the programs is important to ensure their success.","['digital', 'public', 'health', 'marketing', 'physical', 'activity', 'effect', 'wellbeing', 'saudi', 'arabia']"

How do Employees Experience Digital Monitoring and Coaching to Better Cope with Their Pain: A Pilot Study with a Smartphone Application,2023,"Background: Pain complaints are an important problem for employees, employers, and society. Up to 60% of the working population suffers from pain and these complaints are responsible for a third of all absenteeism. Pain is a complex phenomenon influenced by physical and psychosocial factors. Digital technologies such as smartphone applications offer opportunities to empower employees and help them manage and cope with their pain. However, lack of empirical evidence and user-friendly design hinder the adoption of these technologies in practice. This one group open label pilot aimed at evaluating the impact and user experience of an innovative smartphone application that includes monitoring as well as coaching to help employees manage their pain.&#x0D; Methods: An extensive co-design process including 262 end-users and seven domain experts was used to develop an app that contains 1) a monitoring part with questionnaires and integration with an activity tracker and 2) a coaching part including online information and exercises to help improve pain-related cognitions and other pain-management skills. Afterwards, 66 employees (experiencing pain for at least six weeks) of a large Belgian hospital used the smartphone app for six months. Every six weeks, participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire measuring work expectations, pain-related perceptions, and pain behavior. Finally, 12 employees participated in a semi-structured interview to help understand the quantitative findings, evaluate the user experience, and formulate recommendations towards the use of pain-management apps for employees. Quantitative and qualitative analyses by means of SPSS (version 28.0.1.0) and NVivo (version 1.0) were conducted to test the hypotheses. &#x0D; Results: Forty-eight participants had complaints, mostly located in the back (80%) and neck (74%), for at least one year. Only pain catastrophizing (χ2=15.934, p = .001) and fear avoidance (χ2=8.934, p = .030) were improved after using the app for six months. Participants experienced the app as useful and well elaborated. Based on the thematic analysis, seven recommendations emerged: 1) awareness and education about pain and pain perceptions stimulates behavior change, but make sure that the focus is on coping with pain and valued activities and not on the pain itself, 2) monitoring should be user friendly, accurate, and relevant, 3) the ability to explore and learn at your own pace is a must, 4) app functionalities should be attractive and provide maximal reward while requiring minimal effort from the user, 5) personalized and job-specific content is a must, 6) a blended approach, i.e. digital tools combined with human contact with a professional expert, is recommended, and 7) integration within a broader well-being policy at work is required.&#x0D; Conclusion: A smartphone application may help employees to monitor and cope with their pain at work. Provided that it meets some specific requirements: 1) an app is not used as a standalone but integrated within a broader wellbeing policy at work, 2) there is the possibility to interact with a professional, and 3) an app contains personal and job-specific recommendations tailored to the workplace and specific needs of the user.","['employees', 'experience', 'digital', 'monitoring', 'coaching', 'better', 'cope', 'their', 'pain:', 'pilot', 'study', 'smartphone', 'application']"
An innovative integrated solution to support digital postural assessment using the TACOs methodology,2024,"The diversification of work as well as the challenges of modern industrial tasks make manual ergonomic assessment tools (i.e., checklist, excel-based worksheet) time consuming and strongly related to the ergonomist's experience. Recent advancements in wearable sensors technology offer new perspectives in terms of integrating human-monitoring solutions with traditional ergonomics methods by movements' digitization. Furthermore, digital posture assessment plays a critical role in the context of Industry 5.0, promoting worker well-being and productivity by identifying ergonomic risks and optimizing work environments. Also, leveraging advanced technologies for posture assessment enables proactive intervention strategies to mitigate musculoskeletal disorders and enhance overall workplace safety and efficiency. The present study proposes an innovative hardware and software solution which allows even non-expert designers or ergonomists to carry out a reliable postural ergonomic assessment according to well-known ergonomic methods, speeding up the analysis and providing accurate information. The setup consists of a wearable suit and its proprietary software tool specifically programmed to carry out the ergonomic assessment according to the Time-Based Assessment COmputerized Strategy (TACOs) method. The setup has been preliminarily tested in a controlled environment simulating a real industrial scenario and a comparison with standard ergonomic practices has been performed. The Mann-Whitney U test returned a p-value of [2.198e-11] < α [0.05] demonstrating how the solution proposes results which are numerically and qualitatively enhanced while showing the practical utility of the suggested technical setup and the validity of the suggested digital technique in retrieving and recognizing the workers' posture.","['innovative', 'integrated', 'solution', 'support', 'digital', 'postural', 'assessment', 'tacos', 'methodology']"
A MODEL OF TRAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMY IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION,2024,"In modern economic conditions, an important role is assigned to the system of training of highly qualified specialists with skills and competencies necessary for work in the conditions of digitalization, introduction of new technologies and innovations. The construction industry is developing quite rapidly, new construction materials and software are appearing, employers’ requirements to personnel are toughening and, accordingly, there is a high outflow of qualified personnel from the industry. All this requires new approaches to personnel training both for the construction industry and for the economy of the country's regions as a whole.

DEVELOPMENT OF A SOFTWARE PLATFORM FOR MAKING RATIONAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IN INDUSTRIAL BEEKEEPING,2024,"Background. Beekeeping is one of the agricultural sectors where digital technology is not widely utilized. This results in high proportion of manual labor used in production of honey and related products, low productivity of bee colonies and decline in production efficiency in general. Purpose. To create a methodology leveraging software platforms to help automate and optimize agricultural workplaces. This will bring substantial information and visibility to agricultural specialists/workers which will allow them to predict inventory and other outputs from beekeeping farms and infrastructure. The methodology includes the calculation of indicators, which considers the influence of external factors on the apiaries’ performance depending on the terrain and weather conditions. Materials and methods. The developed methods were derived by making calculations based off environmental variables such as terrain and weather conditions. It is these variables that affect the movement and migration of bees. During the process of environmental monitoring, honey collection and production were observed and noted as the initial array of research materials. The software platform was designed and optimized leveraging methods of mathematical and data modeling, along with various algorithms were used. Results. The new software solution was successfully tested and validated in several agricultural organizations of Stavropolsky region. Conclusion. The obtained quantitative characteristics such as increase of the higher-quality honey and decrease in production costs confirmed the usefulness of applying the newly created technological solution, which will further provide support and propel the beekeeping industry to a higher level of development and advancement.","['development', 'software', 'platform', 'making', 'rational', 'management', 'decisions', 'industrial', 'beekeeping']"
"""Eye in the Sky"": Employee Surveillance in the Public Sector",2015,"Developments in modern technology, such as digital video, GPS, and email and computer monitoring software, have made it exponentially easier for employers to monitor and investigate employees, safeguard company property, and increase employee productivity. (2) However, as these forms of surveillance technology become more readily accessible to a majority of employers, more and more employers are at an increased risk of infringing upon employee rights. This is especially true in the public sector, where, in New York, employers are bound by the strictures of the Taylor Law, (3) which governs the rights of unions for public employers in New York, as well as the limitations on warrantless searches and seizures pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. (4) In addition, public employers must be wary of the multitude of state and federal statutes designed to protect employee privacy. (5) The widespread use of such surveillance by employers in recent years has been well-documented: * a 2007 survey (6) conducted by the American Management Association (AMA) and the ePolicy Institute found that, among the companies surveyed: ** 66 percent monitor employee Internet activity; (7) ** nearly half (48 percent) use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage, while 7 percent use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance; (8) ** 45 percent monitor time spent and numbers called from office phones, while another 16 percent record phone conversations; (9) ** two studies by Aberdeen Group in 2012 found that 62 percent of employers with field employees use GPS to track staff, as reported by Workforce Magazine; and (10) * a 2013 poll found that 37 percent of the hiring managers and human resources professionals surveyed use social networking sites to prescreen candidates for employment. (11) This article will summarize and analyze the cases and statutes that define the legal framework within which New York public employers, including school districts, must operate when implementing particular forms of employee surveillance, such as video surveillance, email monitoring, and GPS tracking. Part I will examine a public employer's duty to negotiate when it comes to employee surveillance, and includes summaries of the pertinent decisions of the New York Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) and discusses what these decisions mean for public employers. Part II will synopsize the pertinent case law interpreting the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as it applies to searches in the employment context, including the monitoring of employee text messages on employer-issued cell phones, and the installation of GPS on private employee vehicles to track employee whereabouts. Finally, Part III will briefly summarize the state and federal statutes that apply to the different forms of employee surveillance conducted by public employers in New York State. I. NEGOTIABILITY OF EMPLOYEE SURVEILLANCE An employer choosing to unilaterally carry out a method of employee surveillance must, in the first instance, ensure that such surveillance does not interfere with the right of its employees to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment. (12) It can be difficult, however, for management to balance its obligation to supervise its employees, and maintain security of the workplace and its property, with its duty to negotiate. (13) This typically becomes an issue where a particular method of surveillance implicates employee job security, intrudes upon an employee's personal belongings or private information, or interferes with an employee's off-duty time. (14) Improper practice charges relating to employee surveillance can arise in varying contexts, depending on the type and location of the surveillance, the level of involvement required of the employees, and the purpose of the surveillance. …","['""eye', 'sky"":', 'employee', 'surveillance', 'public', 'sector']"
Evaluation of an interdisciplinary education program to foster learning health systems (Preprint),2023,"Learning health systems (LHS) have the potential to use health data in real time through rapid and continuous cycles of data interrogation, implementing insights to practice, feedback, and practice change. However, there is a lack of an appropriately skilled interprofessional informatics workforce that can leverage knowledge to design innovative solutions. Therefore, there is a need to develop tailored professional development training in digital health, to foster skilled interprofessional learning communities in the health care workforce in Australia. This study aimed to explore participants' experiences and perspectives of participating in an interprofessional education program over 13 weeks. The evaluation also aimed to assess the benefits, barriers, and opportunities for improvements and identify future applications of the course materials. We developed a wholly online short course open to interdisciplinary professionals working in digital health in the health care sector. In a flipped classroom model, participants (n=400) undertook 2 hours of preclass learning online and then attended 2.5 hours of live synchronous learning in interactive weekly Zoom workshops for 13 weeks. Throughout the course, they collaborated in small, simulated learning communities (n=5 to 8), engaging in various activities and problem-solving exercises, contributing their unique perspectives and diverse expertise. The course covered a number of topics including background on LHS, establishing learning communities, the design thinking process, data preparation and machine learning analysis, process modeling, clinical decision support, remote patient monitoring, evaluation, implementation, and digital transformation. To evaluate the purpose of the program, we undertook a mixed methods evaluation consisting of pre- and postsurveys rating scales for usefulness, engagement, value, and applicability for various aspects of the course. Participants also completed identical measures of self-efficacy before and after (n=200), with scales mapped to specific skills and tasks that should have been achievable following each of the topics covered. Further, they undertook voluntary weekly surveys to provide feedback on which aspects to continue and recommendations for improvements, via free-text responses. From the evaluation, it was evident that participants found the teaching model engaging, useful, valuable, and applicable to their work. In the self-efficacy component, we observed a significant increase (P<.001) in perceived confidence for all topics, when comparing pre- and postcourse ratings. Overall, it was evident that the program gave participants a framework to organize their knowledge and a common understanding and shared language to converse with other disciplines, changed the way they perceived their role and the possibilities of data and technologies, and provided a toolkit through the LHS framework that they could apply in their workplaces. We present a program to educate the health workforce on integrating the LHS model into standard practice. Interprofessional collaborative learning was a major component of the value of the program. This evaluation shed light on the multifaceted challenges and expectations of individuals embarking on a digital health program. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of the audience is crucial for creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment. Addressing these challenges will not only enhance participant engagement but also contribute to the overall success of the program and, by extension, the broader integration of digital health solutions into health care practice and, ultimately, patient outcomes.","['evaluation', 'interdisciplinary', 'education', 'program', 'foster', 'learning', 'health', 'systems', '(preprint)']"
Human-Data Interaction as a critical enabler of Electronic Performance Monitoring at construction sites,2024,"Human-Data Interaction (HDI) revolves around how humans generate, process, and utilise data. HDI plays a crucial role in evaluating data collection and use in the context of the construction industry, considering the impact on stakeholders such as site managers and labourers. One significant application of HDI is in on-site Electronic Performance Monitoring (EPM), which aims to leverage workplace innovations to enhance productivity, safety, and health. However, the integration and implications of HDI and EPM lack comprehensive understanding. This research seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting a human-data perspective on sensored construction sites, emphasising the challenges and opportunities for driving innovative EPM initiatives. Through a combination of literature review, surveys with HDI experts, and the authors' perspectives and abduction, conceptual frameworks are developed that cluster HDI and EPM. The study's implications are multifaceted, impacting both theoretical understanding and practical applications. The findings highlight the key actors and the data they generate and manipulate across different platforms during EPM deployment. Through the lens of explanatory theories, sociomateriality, and work sociology, the research contributes to understanding the fragmented nature of HDI and EPM as a managerial issue embedded in the work environment. It sheds light on the interactions of actors using digital EPM devices and relevant data streams influenced by the limited agency of specific stakeholders, such as labourers, and the potential neglect of factors related to their well-being. This research distinguishes itself by focusing on the less explored intersection of HDI and EPM in the construction industry. It offers a novel perspective by considering the sensored environment of construction sites as a venue for analysing human-data interactions.","['human-data', 'interaction', 'critical', 'enabler', 'electronic', 'performance', 'monitoring', 'construction', 'sites']"
How Do Algorithmic Management Practices Affect Workforce Well-Being? A Parallel Moderated Mediation Model,2024,"Modern workplaces increasingly use algorithmic management practices (AMPs), which shape task assignment, monitoring, and evaluation. Despite the potential benefits these practices offer, like increased efficiency and objectivity, their impact on workforce well-being (WFW) has raised concerns. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT) and conservation of resources theory (COR), this study examines the relationship between algorithmic management practices and workforce well-being, incorporating job burnout (JBO) and perceived threat (PT) as parallel mediators and person-job fit (PJF) as a moderator. The research employed a cross-sectional survey design targeting 2450 KOSGEB-registered manufacturing SMEs in Istanbul, Turkey. A sample of 666 respondents participated, and the data were analyzed using Smart PLS 4, employing structural equation modeling to test the proposed model. The results indicated that algorithmic management practices significantly increased job burnout and perceived threat, both of which negatively impacted workforce well-being. However, the direct effect of algorithmic management practices on workforce well-being was non-significant. Person-job fit moderated the relationships between algorithmic management practices and both job burnout and perceived threat, further influencing workforce well-being. The findings underscore the critical need for organizations to balance algorithmic efficiency with human-centric practices. Prioritizing person-job fit and fostering transparency in algorithmic processes can mitigate negative impacts, enhance employee well-being, and drive sustainable organizational success in the digital age.","['algorithmic', 'management', 'practices', 'affect', 'workforce', 'well-being?', 'parallel', 'moderated', 'mediation', 'model']"
"Greener theatre, greener surgery – environmental sustainability in a rural surgical setup",2023,"In 2009, the Lancet Global Health Commission called climate change the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.1 Surgery is a resource-intensive activity due to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the form of anaesthetic gas and single-use medical consumables resulting in large amounts of waste.2, 3 MacNeill et al. studied operating theatres in the UK, Canada and USA and found that the carbon burden of an operating theatre is about 188 tonnes CO2e per theatre per year.3 It is estimated that a typical operation has comparable emissions to driving 600 to 1100 km in an average car.2 In 2018, healthcare contributed to 4.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions.4 In the last decade, there has been a push towards environmentally sustainable surgical practices. RACS has published a position paper on the environmental impact of surgical practice that calls for action to reduce the environmental impact of surgery. Suggested approach to this issue would be the five Rs – reduce, reuse, recycle, rethink and research.5 To lead this change, in 2022 RACS moved to make the ANZ journal a digital-only publication to reduce the waste burden.6 The first step in implementing change is to acknowledge the problem. There have been few survey-based studies that indicated barriers and attitudes towards sustainable surgical and anaesthetic practices. These studies highlighted the need to understand the local institution-based knowledge among medical and nursing personnel.7-11 This study seeks to assess the understanding, behaviours and attitudes of staff of the operating theatre. It also seeks to identify barriers to sustainable surgical practice and to formulate strategies to reduce waste in the day-to-day operating theatre management. In addition to collecting opinions, this survey serves as a means of educating staff regarding the importance of working towards environmentally sustainable healthcare. This study would form part of the first phase of our plan to initiate sustainable surgical practices in our local operating theatres. This study was a cross-sectional survey including participants involved in theatre-related activity in our local hospital which included the surgical team, anaesthetic team, theatre nurses, CSSD (central sterilizing supply department) staff, clinical administration staff, operating theatre assistants and medical students rotating to the surgical department. The survey was created on Qualtrics and distributed by email and flyers with a QR code in the operating theatres. Participation in the survey was voluntary and without incentive with an estimated time to complete the survey of about 5 minutes. The survey consisted of closed-ended questions with categorical yes or no responses or using a 5-point Likert scale which ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree. There were 7 of these compulsory questions. There were also 2 open-ended questions which were optional to allow participants to express opinions and suggest strategies that can be carried out to improve sustainability. The key sections in this survey were: (i) demographics, (ii) current attitudes and personal behaviours, (iii) engagement in sustainability and perceived barriers to change (iv) sustainability in the surgical workplace. See Appendix I for survey questions. Ethical approval was given by the Greater Western Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 2022/ETH00898; 2022/STE02592). The survey was conducted in Griffith Base Hospital between July 2022 until September 2022. Thirty-six participants returned a response of whom 67% are female and 33% are male. The roles of the respondents included nurses (42%), doctors (39%), medical students (14%) and theatre assistants or administration staff (5%). See Appendix II for table of responses. Figure 1 shows respondents’ attitudes and behaviours towards climate change. In our regional hospital we have found staff agree that climate change is concerning (89%) and that healthcare poses significant impacts on the environment (75%). Climate change has caused most respondents (86%) to change their behaviour in their personal life but only a smaller proportion have changed their behaviour at work (61%). Figure 2 shows respondents’ willingness to engage in measures to improve environmental sustainability in surgical practice. Majority are willing to engage in environmentally sustainable activities (97%) but most felt that they did not have the support of the hospital (22%) or colleagues (44%) in achieving this. About half of respondents (53%) agreed that they had the knowledge to improve sustainability at work but of these only a small group strongly agreed (11%). The other half (47%) disagreed or were neutral regarding this. When asked about barriers to change, lack of recycling facilities was perceived as the greatest barrier (92%) followed by inadequate training and information (81%). Other barriers to change in order were staff attitude (78%), time (72%), lack of leadership (69%), lack of support from colleagues (58%) and cost (58%). Only a small proportion of respondents considered safety (39%) to be a barrier. Respondents were also asked to respond in free text if they thought of any other barriers and few respondents mentioned a lack of government and hospital policy surrounding this. Another barrier suggested were poor staffing levels and needing to determine whose role it is carry out these strategies such as disposing of the recycling waste. Respondents were asked about strategies that they believed would be helpful in improving environmental sustainability. The most useful strategies were standardizing operating trays (97%) and using energy-efficient appliances (97%). Other strategies following these include switching off lights (94%), reusing unopened surgical equipment where appropriate (92%), placing recycling bins in operating theatres (92%), using a real-time power monitoring tool (86%) and conducting an audit on energy use (86%). Other strategies which were deemed helpful but less so included eliminating or reducing single-use items (83%), using low-energy lighting (81%), conducting an audit on waste production (81%) and unplugging equipment (58%). They were also asked to respond in the free text to any proposed suggestions that were not listed. Some of these suggestions include creating a steering committee to oversee education and efforts to ensure sustainable practice in the operating theatres. There were suggestions to reduce the amount of single-use equipment and reuse or recycle unused sterile drapes that have not been contaminated. Dedicated recycle bins should be made available for staff and patients. There are many suggestions on things that can be recycled in the operating theatres such as the cardboard from equipment, oxygen tubing/masks, IV bags, copper wire stripping of diathermy plates and electrical leads. When asked about their perceptions on the economic impact of environmentally friendly changes, respondents were divided in their responses. Majority have responded with unsure (47%) while some believe it will save money and increase revenue (31%) and others believe it will incur more costs and resources (22%). Published surveys have all found medical practitioners to be concerned regarding climate change and willing to engage in environmentally sustainable strategies.7-11 This local survey which included not only doctors but also other stakeholders of the operating theatre has shown the same results regarding perception and willingness to engage. Recycling is a strategy that was suggested by respondents as currently recycle bins are not available in our theatres. The lack of recycling facilities (92%) has been perceived as the greatest barrier to change in our operating theatres. There are many items throughout the patient's surgical journey that can be recycled such as paper, bottles and blue sterile wrapping. In some studies, it was found that up to 90% of waste generated from surgery was recyclable.12 In addition to that, waste destruction processes produce high GHG emissions and hence waste segregation between regulated medical waste and domestic waste is important in reducing emissions. Literature has shown that stakeholders often incorrectly segregated waste and this is a result of insufficient education.12 The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) position paper in 2018 outlined the environmental impact of surgical practice and recommended surgeons to take leadership roles in efforts to reduce the impact of surgery on the environment.5 More than half of respondents believed there was a lack of leadership (69%) and a lack of support from colleagues (58%) in environmentally sustainable efforts in our local operating theatre. Many studies have suggested the importance of leadership and early engagement of stakeholders.2, 13 NSW government published a policy document which encompassed a vision and strategy for 7 years (2016–2023) to mitigate the negative impact of health activities on the environment. The vision is to create a resource efficient health system that reduces cost and reduces impact on the environment. The strategy encompasses some targets and key performance indicators regarding energy use, water use and waste management.14 In keeping with this vision, a potential strategy that can be implemented in our local hospital is to set up a local steering committee regarding environmental sustainability in the operating theatres. This committee should not be limited to one profession and should be ideally made up of surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and administration staff. This will allow collaborative oversight of all efforts to be carried out by all stakeholders. Most respondents agreed that inadequate training and information (81%) was a barrier to change in this survey. Only half the respondents (53%) believed they had the knowledge to improve sustainability at work. Studies attempting to implement changes in practice to improve waste management have found that barriers can be counteracted with staff education and continual engagement.13 There is a potential to improve staff education regarding sustainable practices through information sessions, visual signage or verbal reminders during meetings to emphasize the importance of working together to improve environmental sustainability. In a systematic review of the carbon footprints from operating theatres, major contributors were energy use and consumables. Some studies suggested that electricity accounted for majority of carbon footprint with the highest consumption of electricity coming from maintaining the theatre environment with heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.15 In this survey, respondents ranked the use of energy efficient appliances as the most useful strategy (97%) and second to that were remembering to switch off lights (94%). Strategies to improve energy efficiency such as installing low energy lighting, more efficient air-conditioning and renewable energy sources require changes to infrastructure which can only be achieved with long term planning and adequate funding. Simpler strategies such as switching off lights or equipment when not in use can be implemented immediately and enforced with visual reminders such as signs. Single-use items are considered a large contributor to carbon footprint.15 The literature suggests that reusable instruments reduce cost and environmental impact compared with disposable instruments.16 Therefore, encouraging the use of reusable instruments should be preferred. The standardization of operating trays was also considered the most useful strategy (97%). This strategy is feasible to implement in the short term but would require cooperation from surgeons in having judicious selection of instruments for their trays and nursing staff to be well learned in the contents of trays. This can minimize wastage of single use item and reduce need for sterilization, reprocessing and repackaging reusable instruments. There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, the small sample size which reflects the small number of staff in our regional hospital impacts the generalizability of our results. Another limitation is that the survey was collected anonymously to increase participation and honesty of responses but this meant it was not possible to calculate response rates. Furthermore, when respondents were asked regarding barriers to change and strategies that they believe would be helpful, the original pilot study required respondents to rank their answers. However, this was too complicated and resulted in some respondents delaying the completion of the survey altogether. Therefore, these questions were changed to yes/no responses in the final questionnaire. It has been suggested that practices that are beneficial for the environment can also be cost-saving.2 In this survey, respondents were asked about their perceptions on the economic impact of environmentally friendly changes and respondents were divided in their responses. Future projects can look into the economic costs of implementing environmentally sustainable changes and whether or not it increases or reduces cost. Further studies that seek to quantify the cost and effect of any strategies implemented would be beneficial in supporting environmentally sustainable practices in the operating theatre. Operating theatres have a significant carbon footprint. This survey has shown that stakeholders in our regional hospital are concerned regarding the impact of climate change and are willing to engage in more environmentally sustainable activities. We have proposed some strategies that can be implemented in our practice and will aim to create a steering committee to lead efforts in implementing environmentally sustainable changes in our operating theatres.

Advancing health equity‐Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality research and action agenda,2023,"The United States continues to grapple with profound and persistent health inequities that harm its vitality. President Biden's Executive Order (EO) outlined the first-ever “whole of government” comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all people. It defined equity as “the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.”1 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is acutely aware of inequities embedded with the US healthcare system that stand in the way of advancing equity for all people. AHRQ has a long history of funding and disseminating research to address inequities and advance health and healthcare equity. This focus continues as demonstrated by the publication of a Special Emphasis Notice (SEN) to highlight AHRQ's interest in new and innovative investigator-initiated grant applications focused on health services research to advance health equity and a Request for Application (RFA) specifically aimed at building new evidence regarding the implementation and effectiveness of equity-focused evidence-based interventions to address disparities and advance equitable care in healthcare delivery systems.2 Over the past 2 years, AHRQ has examined equity in its work, including internal workplace culture, policies and procedures for administrating research programs, and opportunities to center health and healthcare equity within our research priorities. As part of the latter, AHRQ is establishing an Equity Agenda and Action Plan, leveraging its core capabilities of research, practice improvement, data and analytics, and health systems workforce training. AHRQ hosted a multistakeholder Health Equity Summit and invited five papers to summarize the state of the evidence and provide input for this equity research agenda in five action domains for which AHRQ, as well as health services researchers, could drive more equitable care: (1) Healthcare Delivery System Structure, (2) Payment, (3) Social Determinants of Health & Social Needs, (4) Implementation Science, and (5) Access to Care (Figure 1). This commentary describes the inclusive agenda-building process, presents a Research and Action Health Equity Framework used by participants of the Summit to explore the action domains through an equity lens, and highlights key cross-cutting themes that emerged from the five domain papers that can serve as a basis for informing a research agenda for AHRQ and the field of health services research, more broadly. To amplify all voices, AHRQ worked with Langco + Partners3 to ground principles of equity-centered community design and community-based participatory research in the Health Equity Summit. This approach focuses on the historical and current contexts of systemic racial inequity and rebuilding and maintaining trust among stakeholder communities. In December 2021, AHRQ convened a stakeholder Summit planning meeting that included more than 50 diverse stakeholders and users of AHRQ research, data, and tools. Participants included healthcare systems leaders, researchers, and patient and family advocates. The group discussed the scope, goals, and strategies to center principles of equity, diversity, anti-racism, inclusiveness, and accessibility within the design and structure of the Summit. The participants also provided feedback on an Equity Research and Action Framework within the context of AHRQ's mission that illustrates five action domains: (1) Healthcare Delivery System Structure, (2) Payment, (3) Social Determinants of Health & Social Needs, (4) Implementation Science, and (5) Access to Care (Figure 1). These action domains could support health and healthcare systems to deliver equitable care, and reduce inequities in quality, safety, and value. The center of the figure shows the equity lens magnifying the critical action domains in which AHRQ could make an impact. Notably, the focus on these domains is undergirded by AHRQ's core competencies health services research; practice improvement (tools and products to speed the translation of research into action); data and analytics (use of data to inform program and policy decisions); and training (health system workforce). AHRQ's core capabilities could support equity in the five critical action domains. At the far left, the ecological context has four nested levels: individual; community; institutions/organizations; policy, systems, and environment. This context has a crucial bidirectional, dynamic relationship with the five action domains. The context and action domains must be considered simultaneously to develop meaningful research questions and ensure that results and products are actionable and can directly address health system needs and priorities in advancing health and healthcare equity for the populations they serve. AHRQ invited five teams to author papers on the framework's five action domains. The teams conducted evidence-based narrative reviews on the intersection of equity and their domains and recommended priorities to inform a research agenda. The approach was purposefully pragmatic and was meant to stimulate innovation. Rather than conducting formal systematic reviews, AHRQ encouraged each team to tailor their approach to the topic, state of the literature, and rapid project timeline so that results could be shared at the Health Equity Summit to maximize the opportunity to go beyond the literature to incorporate diverse voices and experiences of stakeholders. In September 2022, a 2-day Health Equity Summit established a community of belonging, co-created strategies to advance equity related to the healthcare system, and identified opportunities for AHRQ to drive progress. The goals of the Summit included (1) developing a shared understanding and language to describe health equity for AHRQ's vision and mission; (2) exploring shared experiences of stakeholders about the impact of structural racism on the healthcare delivery system with implications for improving system performance; and (3) empowering stakeholders to serve as change agents. Full-group community-building sessions bridged to smaller break-out sessions, each focused on one of the five critical research and action domains. The small-group participants received the initial paper outline and discussion questions before the Summit. One paper author and a professional facilitator co-led each small group session, and the groups utilized Jamboard, a real-time, interactive, collaborative tool. These processes prioritized empowered and equitable participation. They ensured all voices and contributions from the diverse stakeholder community were captured for later use by the author teams in updating the papers. AHRQ provided each author team with recordings from the breakout sessions and images of Jamboards. Authors met with AHRQ to discuss updates to their papers based on stakeholder input and resolve potential areas of overlap. The writing teams finalized papers, which underwent peer review for Health Services Research (HSR). The articles in the special issue that follow aim to meet the research and evidence base in each domain “where it is,” reflect lived experiences and community voices, including those who are often minoritized, and provide input regarding where AHRQ and the field of health services research should go while prioritizing importance, impact, and innovation. Within the health care system, vanquishing inequities and “ensuring consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities,”1 is a core AHRQ value. The commissioned papers in this special issue of HSR inform priorities in the five key action domains in the Research and Action Health Equity Framework: (1) Healthcare Delivery System Structure, (2) Payment, (3) Social Determinants of Health & Social Needs, (4) Implementation Science, and (5) Access to Care. These papers incorporate a review of the literature, diverse stakeholder input, and expert opinion to inform and provide feedback on AHRQ's research agenda to support advances in health equity while also guiding the feild of health services reserach more broadly. The papers also indicate where AHRQ and its partners can play a leading role in vanquishing inequities. Below, we summarize cross-cutting themes and conclusions from the five papers. The themes are important considerations for exploring AHRQ's research agenda of advancing health equity. The healthcare system's primary goal should be to improve health and health equity, and patients and communities should be integral parts of this process. The papers remind us that the healthcare system's primary purpose is to provide high-quality care and maximize everyone's health, not solely to maximize efficiency. Consistently, each of the papers emphasizes the importance of authentic engagement and participation of patients and communities in research to advance health equity, as their lived experiences and expertise are essential to understanding and addressing health inequities effectively. However, patients and communities are diverse, and it is essential to tailor solutions to them, especially for the most minoritized. In their paper, Baumann et al. outline four guiding principles and critical dissemination and implementation science domains with solid promise for accelerating progress toward healthcare equity.4 Not surprisingly, meaningful engagement with patients and communities is central to each principle and the overall pathway by which dissemination and implementation science can promote the delivery and monitoring of more equitable healthcare. Additionally, Jindal et al., use the Levesque et al. framework5 to highlight six dimensions of access, which, respectively, emphasize patient and community-centric factors.6 These access dimensions: approachability (e.g., system trustworthiness; authentic community engagement, partnership, and project co-development), acceptability (e.g., cultural tailoring, addressing bias, identity concordance between patient and clinician), availability (e.g., geographic distribution of services, in-person vs. virtual care delivery, type of health care team member providing service), accommodation (e.g., interpreter services, accessible space for persons with disabilities), affordability (e.g., insurance coverage, out of pocket costs, opportunity costs for patients grappling with access barriers), and appropriateness (e.g., racial/ethnic bias in algorithms; low-value care given to marginalized patients) can be operationalized to center patients and communities and therefore can guide more equitable access to care. However, historical and present-day intersectional systems of oppression such as structural racism, sexism, and homophophia (also discussed in Theme 2) have largely been missing from access frameworks and research, thereby limiting the overall impact of current findings to have a meaningful impact on disparities. Peek et al. also directly address the need for SDOH and social care research to tailor or adapt interventions to address specific sociocultural priorities of socially marginalized communities and populations.7 Focusing on examining the heterogeneity in the effect of an intervention across people with different social identities, in collaboration with communities and an inclusive and diverse research team, improves outcomes among marginalized groups and reduces (or not worsens) inequities. Understanding and directly addressing these factors deeply embedded in our society's foundation are vital to creating anti-racist and equity-centered solutions to break the cycle of persistent health disparities. While other social science fields have studied structural racism for years, health services research has tended to focus on interpersonal racism and implicit bias. Within their guiding principles, Baumann et al. explicitly call out the need to recognize and address racism and oppression in dissemination and implementation frameworks and approaches that conceptualize healthcare settings.4 This allows for a deeper and more transparent understanding of the impacts of structural racism, which in turn can inform policies and practices that promote equity. Peek et al. highlight the need for social care and SDOH interventions to address structural racism and other systems of oppression more directly.7 This includes conceptualizing racism and social marginalization as SDOH. This, they note, can lead to the development of interventions to address structural racism in healthcare delivery systems, new patient experience measures of racism and social health inequity, and interventions to mitigate bias that go beyond implicit bias training. Additionally, Chisolm et al., assert any conceptualization of the health and healthcare system must recognize and address embedded racism and prejudice at the outset, thereby anchoring their recommendations for research and action in anti-racist and anti-discriminatory practices that counter systemic racism and oppression.8 More specifically, the proposals target the multiple nested levels, dependencies, and complexities of the health and healthcare system yet cluster around structural opportunities, whether training programs to promote a well-trained, diverse workforce in health systems, research to drive evidence-based, culturally tailored care, or testing of innovative equity funding models to reduce racially targeted disinvestments. While research may have moved from operationalizing racism and oppression at only the individual level to a focus embedded within institutional and societal structures, multiple systems are acting together to reinforce inequities, thus necessitating an even wider equity lens to understand the relationships and interactions. Eschliman et al., define payment as “the mechanism for compensating healthcare providers or other service providers for services and goods (e.g., paying a physician for an office visit) and financing as the mechanism for procuring the funding available for payment (e.g., a state legislature passing a Medicaid budget or health insurers charging enrollees premiums).”9 They highlight the limitations of value-based payment reforms, which, to date, have not successfully promoted health equity because of the emphasis on savings (focused on financial risk) and lack of innovation around reforms in financing. The authors point to a gap in evidence and a range of problems ripe for research and action, including differential distribution of health care resources and payment across communities, scarcity of financing for populations most in need including financing of health-related social services, lack of integration across health and social services and no accountability for whole-person health outcomes. Potential solutions could address these problems as well as adjust patient cost-sharing to increase access to high-value care (e.g., value-based insurance design; defining high vs. low-value care), and develop equity-related metrics, including those that incorporate patient experience. Chisolm, Peek, and their colleagues also highlight the vital role of payment and financing in driving equity.7, 8 They also focus on innovation—looking to new partnership models between health systems and communities and efforts to continue testing approaches to align and incentivize delivery systems to address social needs, such as food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers. Chisolm et al. explicitly consider the benefits of integrative whole-person and whole-community approaches, notably features that allow for scalable and sustainable improvements to advance health equity.8 Similarly, Baumann et al., state “Given the factors that shape health are complex and patient-level interventions alone are not sufficient to achieve healthcare equity, implementation of multi-level (e.g., individual, clinical, community), multisector (e.g., across healthcare, housing, transportation, social services), practice-based, and policy interventions are needed to achieve an equitable healthcare system for all populations.”4 The authors highlight a range of often neglected or omitted factors significant for health inequities across multiple levels and sectors. Eschliman et al. describe the need for a whole-person approach by reflecting on the failures of the current payment system in which no one healthcare entity is accountable for all aspects of health and wellbeing.9 Thus, they note, we will likely fail to achieve optimal health for all, especially if we fail to address non-clinical factors, such as social needs, that health systems continue to delegate to others. These papers underscore why we will continue to fall short of reaching our goal of equitable care for all if we remain fragmented and siloed. Interventions, programs, and policies to address inequities must break down walls across sectors and link health systems and communities. Dissemination and implementation science is a tool to understand and influence how scientific evidence is put into practice, and why, how, and for whom improvements in health and healthcare delivery are achieved or not. Baumann et al. illustrate the power and promise of seeing dissemination and implementation science through an equity lens.4 Their guiding principles center and draw attention to how practitioners, researchers, and health system leaders can use dissemination and implementation science to tangibly advance the rate of acceleration and adoption of evidence-based interventions and practices to address health disparities. Yet historically, equity has not been an explicit focus of dissemination and implementation science. Each of the papers points to evidence gaps that, if addressed, could foster both de-implementation and adaption of interventions to prevent harm,6 build needed tailored interventions,8 stimulate more transparent discussion on limits to current payment strategies and potential solutions, and improve collaboration with diverse partners and communities to develop innovative ways to integrate health and social care.7, 8 What underlies these recommendations across the five papers is a critical need for evidence across diverse contexts, populations, and settings to guide creation of a more equitable healthcare system. Moreover, the authors note a sense of urgency, as misuse of existing evidence can exacerbate health inequities and cause harm. Explicit attention to equity at each step of the evidence-generation process from design, to implementation, and evaluation of innovative practices is critical. Embedding an equity lens at each stage can support the widespread and accelerated use of effective interventions that improve health for all. Multiple aspects of the healthcare system workforce can perpetuate health and healthcare inequities. Several papers point to the need for more attention to diversity and inclusion within the healthcare workforce and the implications for access to care, health system leadership, structure, culture, care delivery, and research. Jindal et al. describe the role of racism and its relationship to professional values within healthcare systems and the impact of racial/ethnic diversity of providers on access to care, particularly in how patients determine acceptability (perception of their needs being met).6 They also highlight that greater diversity at all levels and aspects of the healthcare workforce is critical to building bi-directional trust and relationships with communities with the greatest need. Both Jindal and Chisolm note that the workforce's lack of representativeness and diversity reflects health system leadership's broader beliefs and values.6, 8 Recruitment of a diverse and inclusive leadership team and approaches for integrating those leaders' perspectives and lived experiences into decision-making can serve as a means to dismantle long-standing inequities. Peek et al. drive the critical need for advances in “inclusive diversity” in care delivery and research teams.7 The authors note that most social care interventions fail because they are not designed and implemented by those who use them. The lack of diversity on the research team and representation of the individuals and community undermines advances in equitable care and even widens disparities. Additionally, the teams highlight the need for innovative training and other grant programs to measure and address interpersonal bias to intervene and mitigate the effects of structural racism while also supporting research to drive and sustain diversity in the healthcare system workforce, including evidence-based practices for recruitment and retention (i.e., ongoing tracking and accountability metrics) to drive to a more inclusive and diverse healthcare system workforce. AHRQ remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing health equity. Over the past year, as the author teams worked diligently with stakeholders to develop their input, we have continued to invest in research efforts to drive more equitable care delivery and support health systems to address health equity. These efforts dovetail with the recommendations. For example, we undertook work to examine the use of digital algorithms in healthcare, their impact on racial/ethnic disparities in care, and approaches to identify and mitigate existing biases.10 We launched the Learning Health System Embedded Scientist Training and Research Centers initiative to train researchers and scientists to conduct system-focused research to advance health equity and enhance workforce diversity.11 Additionally, we funded a research program to leverage dissemination and implementation science to directly address gaps in evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions in diverse populations and settings and test, refine, and implement equity-focused interventions with healthcare delivery systems.12 These new programs align with crucial input from articles in the HSR special issue, including explicit requirements for community partnerships, evidence of a commitment to shared values, co-creation, and co-learning to ensure the findings will be meaningful and effective in advancing equity in healthcare delivery systems. To enhance the diversity of the health services research workforce, AHRQ has announced the Enhancing Workforce Diversity in Health Services Research funding announcement to supplement funding to ongoing research projects that recruit and support researchers from diverse backgrounds, including those shown to be underrepresented in health services research.13 Yet, more is ahead. AHRQ will prioritize and develop our research and action plan informed by insights provided by the authors and stakeholders who contributed their expertise to the five domain papers. Additionally, the crosscutting themes that emerged reflect foundational principles and input from a diverse stakeholder group. Embedding these principles within our research and action plan and continually evaluating the impact of our research investments will support our collective and steadfast commitment to the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including underserved communities.

Igniting executives through reflective development with the composite leadership innovation and change model: a UK automotive manufacturing longitudinal study,2025,"Purpose This study validates the composite leadership innovation and change (CLIC) model, developed by a UK business school and examines its effectiveness in transforming siloed leadership in UK automotive small and medium-sized enterprises (ASMEs). Rooted in leader–member exchange (LMX) and social exchange theory (SET), the model fosters innovative executive leadership teams through reflective development. Design/methodology/approach A two-year longitudinal observational study was conducted in UK ASMEs using an interpretivist approach. It required active participation in the workplace, observing departmental leaders’ interactions, supervision, trust, engagement and idea-sharing. Leadership weaknesses were identified, and CLIC-based reflective exercises were administered. Every three months, shifts from siloed to innovative executive leadership were assessed. Findings By the study’s end, departmental leaders had moved from working in isolation to functioning as an integrated, innovative leadership team. Regular interdepartmental meetings and stronger leader–subordinate relationships fostered idea exchange, enhancing employee productivity, company performance and competitiveness. Practical implications Theoretically, the CLIC model advances knowledge on breaking siloed leadership and fostering executive team leadership. Practically, enterprises struggling with siloed leadership can adopt the model to enhance innovation and performance at the executive level. Future research could examine dysfunctional socio-technical leadership traits, emotional intelligence and readiness to change beyond UK ASMEs. Originality/value This study confirms the effectiveness of the CLIC model in replacing individualised leadership cultures with executive team leadership and promoting collaboration over siloed approaches using both feedback and the CLIC model digital monitoring aid.","['igniting', 'executives', 'through', 'reflective', 'development', 'composite', 'leadership', 'innovation', 'change', 'model:', 'automotive', 'manufacturing', 'longitudinal', 'study']"
"Building Community, Breaking Barriers: Little Free Libraries and Local Action in the United States",2017,"Image 1: A Little Free Library. Image credit: Nadine Kozak.IntroductionLittle Free Libraries give people a reason to stop and exchange things they love: books. It seemed like a really good way to build a sense of community.Dannette Lank, Little Free Library steward, Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, 2013 (Rumage)Against a backdrop of stagnant literacy rates and enduring perceptions of urban decay and the decline of communities in cities (NCES, “Average Literacy”; NCES, “Average Prose”; Putnam 25; Skogan 8), legions of Little Free Libraries (LFLs) have sprung up across the United States between 2009 and the present. LFLs are small, often homemade structures housing books and other physical media for passersby to choose a book to take or leave a book to share with others. People have installed the structures in front of homes, schools, libraries, churches, fire and police stations, community gardens, and in public parks. There are currently 50,000 LFLs around the world, most of which are in the continental United States (Aldrich, “Big”). LFLs encompass building in multiple senses of the term; LFLs are literally tiny buildings to house books and people use the structures for building neighbourhood social capital. The organisation behind the movement cites “building community” as one of its three core missions (Little Free Library). Rowan Moore, theorising humans’ reasons for building, argues desire and emotion are central (16). The LFL movement provides evidence for this claim: stewards erect LFLs based on hope for increased literacy and a desire to build community through their altruistic actions. This article investigates how LFLs build urban community and explores barriers to the endeavour, specifically municipal building and right of way ordinances used in attempts to eradicate the structures. It also examines local responses to these municipal actions and potential challenges to traditional public libraries brought about by LFLs, primarily the decrease of visits to public libraries and the use of LFLs to argue for defunding of publicly provided library services. The work argues that LFLs build community in some places but may threaten other community services. This article employs qualitative content analysis of 261 stewards’ comments about their registered LFLs on the organisation’s website drawn from the two largest cities in a Midwestern state and an interview with an LFL steward in a village in the same state to analyse how LFLs build community. The two cities, located in the state where the LFL movement began, provide a cross section of innovators, early adopters, and late adopters of the book exchanges, determined by their registered charter numbers. Press coverage and municipal documents from six cities across the US gathered through a snowball sample provide data about municipal challenges to LFLs. Blog posts penned by practising librarians furnish some opinions about the movement. This research, while not a representative sample, identifies common themes and issues around LFLs and provides a basis for future research.The act of building and curating an LFL is a representation of shared beliefs about literacy, community, and altruism. Establishing an LFL is an act of civic participation. As Nico Carpentier notes, while some civic participation is macro, carried out at the level of the nation, other participation is micro, conducted in “the spheres of school, family, workplace, church, and community” (17). Ruth H. Landman investigates voluntary activities in the city, including community gardening, and community bakeries, and argues that the people associated with these projects find themselves in a “denser web of relations” than previously (2). Gretchen M. Herrmann argues that neighbourhood garage sales, although fleeting events, build an enduring sense of community amongst participants (189). Ray Oldenburg contends that people create associational webs in what he calls “great good places”; third spaces separate from home and work (20-21). Little Free Libraries and Community BuildingEmotion plays a central role in the decision to become an LFL steward, the person who establishes and maintains the LFL. People recount their desire to build a sense of community and share their love of reading with neighbours (Charter 4684; Charter 8212; Charter 9437; Charter 9705; Charter 16561). One steward in the study reported, “I love books and I want to be able to help foster that love in our neighbourhood as well” (Charter 4369). Image 2: A Little Free Library, bench, water fountain, and dog’s water bowl for passersby to enjoy. Image credit: Nadine Kozak.Relationships and emotional ties are central to some people’s decisions to have an LFL. The LFL website catalogues many instances of memorial LFLs, tributes to librarians, teachers, and avid readers. Indeed, the first Little Free Library, built by Todd Bol in 2009, was a tribute to his late mother, a teacher who loved reading (“Our History”). In the two city study area, ten LFLs are memorials, allowing bereaved families to pass on a loved one’s penchant for sharing books and reading (Charter 1235; Charter 1309; Charter 4604; Charter 6219; Charter 6542; Charter 6954; Charter 10326; Charter 16734; Charter 24481; Charter 30369). In some cases, urban neighbours come together to build, erect, and stock LFLs. One steward wrote: “Those of us who live in this friendly neighborhood collaborated to design[,] build and paint a bungalow themed library” to match the houses in the neighbourhood (Charter 2532). Another noted: “Our neighbor across the street is a skilled woodworker, and offered to build the library for us if we would install it in our yard and maintain it. What a deal!” (Charter 18677). Community organisations also install and maintain LFLs, including 21 in the study population (e.g. Charter 31822; Charter 27155).Stewards report increased communication with neighbours due to their LFLs. A steward noted: “We celebrated the library’s launch on a Saturday morning with neighbors of all ages. We love sitting on our front porch and catching up with the people who stop to check out the books” (Charter 9673). Another exclaimed:within 24 hours, before I had time to paint it, my Little Free Library took on a life of its own. All of a sudden there were lots of books in it and people stopping by. I wondered where these books came from as I had not put any in there. Little kids in the neighborhood are all excited about it and I have met neighbors that I had never seen before. This is going to be fun! (Charter 15981)LFLs build community through social interaction and collaboration. This occurs when neighbours come together to build, install, and fill the structures. The structures also open avenues for conversation between neighbours who had no connection previously. Like Herrmann’s neighbourhood garage sales, LFLs create and maintain social ties between neighbours and link them by the books they share. Additionally, when neighbours gather and communicate at the LFL structure, they create a transitory third space for “informal public life”, where people can casually interact at a nearby location (Oldenburg 14, 288).Building Barriers, Creating CommunityThe erection of an LFL in an urban neighbourhood is not, however, always a welcome sight. The news analysis found that LFLs most often come to the attention of municipal authorities via citizen complaints, which lead to investigations and enforcement of ordinances. In Kansas, a neighbour called an LFL an “eyesore” and an “illegal detached structure” (Tapper). In Wisconsin, well-meaning future stewards contacted their village authorities to ask about rules, inadvertently setting off a six-month ban on LFLs (Stingl; Rumage). Resulting from complaints and inquiries, municipalities regulated, and in one case banned, LFLs, thus building barriers to citizens’ desires to foster community and share books with neighbours.Municipal governments use two major areas of established code to remove or prohibit LFLs: ordinances banning unapproved structures in residents’ yards and those concerned with obstructions to right of ways when stewards locate the LFLs between the public sidewalk and street.In the first instance, municipal ordinances prohibit either front yard or detached structures. Controversies over these ordinances and LFLs erupted in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, in 2012; Leawood, Kansas, in 2014; Shreveport, Louisiana, in 2015; and Dallas, Texas, in 2015. The Village of Whitefish Bay banned LFLs due to an ordinance prohibiting “front yard structures,” including mailboxes (Sanburn; Stingl). In Leawood, the city council argued that an LFL, owned by a nine-year-old boy, violated an ordinance that forbade the construction of any detached structures without city council permission. In Shreveport, the stewards of an LFL received a cease and desist letter from city council for having an “accessory structure” in the front yard (LaCasse; Burris) and Dallas officials knocked on a steward’s front door, informing her of a similar breach (Kellogg).In the second instance, some urban municipalities argued that LFLs are obstructions that block right of ways. In Lincoln, Nebraska, the public works director noted that the city “uses the area between the sidewalk and the street for snow storage in the winter, light poles, mailboxes, things like that.” The director continued: “And I imagine these little libraries are meant to congregate people like a water cooler, but we don’t want people hanging around near the road by the curb” (Heady). Both Lincoln in 2014 and Los Angeles (LA), California, in 2015, cited LFLs for obstructions. In Lincoln, the city notified the Southminster United Methodist Church that their LFL, located between the public sidewalk and street, violated a municipal ordinance (Sanburn). In LA, the Bureau of Street Services notified actor Peter Cook that his LFL, situated in the right of way, was an “obstruction” that Cook had to remove or the city would levy a fine (Moss). The city agreed at a hearing to consider a “revocable permit” for Cook’s LFL, but later denied its issuance (Condes).Stewards who found themselves in violation of municipal ordinances were able to harness emotion and build outrage over limits to individuals’ ability to erect LFLs. In Kansas, the stewards created a Facebook page, Spencer’s Little Free Library, which received over 31,000 likes and messages of support. One comment left on the page reads: “The public outcry will force those lame city officials to change their minds about it. Leave it to the stupid government to rain on everybody’s parade” (“Good”). Children’s author Daniel Handler sent a letter to the nine-year-old steward, writing as Lemony Snicket, “fighting against librarians is immoral and useless in the face of brave and noble readers such as yourself” (Spencer’s). Indeed, the young steward gave a successful speech to city hall arguing that the body should allow the structures because “‘lots of people in the neighborhood used the library and the books were always changing. I think it’s good for Leawood’” (Bauman). Other local LFL supporters also attended council and spoke in favour of the structures (Harper). In LA, Cook’s neighbours started a petition that gathered over 100 signatures, where people left comments including, “No to bullies!” (Lopez). Additionally, neighbours gathered to discuss the issue (Dana). In Shreveport, neighbours left stacks of books in their front yards, without a structure housing them due to the code banning accessory structures. One noted, “I’m basically telling the [Metropolitan Planning Commission] to go sod off” (Friedersdorf; Moss). LFL proponents reacted with frustration and anger at the perceived over-reach of the government toward harmless LFLs. In addition to the actions of neighbours and supporters, the national and local press commented on the municipal constraints. The LFL movement has benefitted from a significant amount of positive press in its formative years, a press willing to publicise and criticise municipal actions to thwart LFL development. Stewards’ struggles against municipal bureaucracies building barriers to LFLs makes prime fodder for the news media. Herbert J. Gans argues an enduring value in American news is “the preservation of the freedom of the individual against the encroachments of nation and society” (50). The juxtaposition of well-meaning LFL stewards against municipal councils and committees provided a compelling opportunity to illustrate this value.National media outlets, including Time (Sanburn), Christian Science Monitor (LaCasse), and The Atlantic, drew attention to the issue. Writing in The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf critically noted:I wish I was writing this to merely extol this trend [of community building via LFLs]. Alas, a subset of Americans are determined to regulate every last aspect of community life. Due to selection bias, they are overrepresented among local politicians and bureaucrats. And so they have power, despite their small-mindedness, inflexibility, and lack of common sense so extreme that they’ve taken to cracking down on Little Free Libraries, of all things. (Friedersdorf, n.p.)Other columnists mirrored this sentiment. Writing in the LA Times, one commentator sarcastically wrote that city officials were “cracking down on one of the country’s biggest problems: small community libraries where residents share books” (Schaub). Journalists argued this was government overreach on non-issues rather than tackling larger community problems, such as income inequality, homelessness, and aging infrastructure (Solomon; Schaub). The protests and negative press coverage led to, in the case of the municipalities with front yard and detached structure ordinances, détente between stewards and councils as the latter passed amendments permitting and regulating LFLs. Whitefish Bay, Leawood, and Shreveport amended ordinances to allow for LFLs, but also to regulate them (Everson; Topil; Siegel). Ordinances about LFLs restricted their number on city blocks, placement on private property, size and height, as well as required registration with the municipality in some cases. Lincoln officials allowed the church to relocate the LFL from the right of way to church property and waived the $500 fine for the obstruction violation (Sanburn). In addition to the amendments, the protests also led to civic participation and community building including presentations to city council, a petition, and symbolic acts of defiance. Through this protest, neighbours create communities—networks of people working toward a common goal. This aspect of community building around LFLs was unintentional but it brought people together nevertheless.Building a Challenge to Traditional Libraries?LFL marketing and communication staff member Margaret Aldrich suggests in The Little Free Library Book that LFLs are successful because they are “gratifyingly doable” projects that can be accomplished by an individual (16). It is this ease of building, erecting, and maintaining LFLs that builds concern as their proliferation could challenge aspects of library service, such as public funding and patron visits. Some professional librarians are in favour of the LFLs and are stewards themselves (Charter 121; Charter 2608; Charter 9702; Charter 41074; Rumage). Others envision great opportunities for collaboration between traditional libraries and LFLs, including the library publicising LFLs and encouraging their construction as well as using LFLs to serve areas without, or far from, a public library (Svehla; Shumaker). While lauding efforts to build community, some professional librarians question the nomenclature used by the movement. They argue the phrase Little Free Libraries is inaccurate as libraries are much more than random collections of books. Instead, critics contend, the LFL structures are closer to book swaps and exchanges than actual libraries, which offer a range of services such as Internet access, digital materials, community meeting spaces, and workshops and programming on a variety of topics (American Library Association; Annoyed Librarian). One university reference and instruction librarian worries about “the general public’s perception and lumping together of little free libraries and actual ‘real’ public libraries” (Hardenbrook). By way of illustration, he imagines someone asking, “‘why do we need our tax money to go to something that can be done for FREE?’” (Hardenbrook). Librarians holding this perspective fear the movement might add to a trend of neoliberalism, limiting or ending public funding for libraries, as politicians believe that the localised, individual solutions can replace publicly funded library services. This is a trend toward what James Ferguson calls “responsibilized” citizens, those “deployed to produce governmentalized results that do not depend on direct state intervention” (172). In other countries, this shift has already begun. In the United Kingdom (UK), governments are devolving formerly public services onto community groups and volunteers. Lindsay Findlay-King, Geoff Nichols, Deborah Forbes, and Gordon Macfadyen trace the impacts of the 2012 Localism Act in the UK, which caused “sport and library asset transfers” (12) to community and volunteer groups who were then responsible for service provision and, potentially, facility maintenance as well. Rather than being in charge of a “doable” LFL, community groups and volunteers become the operators of much larger facilities. Recent efforts in the US to privatise library services as governments attempt to cut budgets and streamline services (Streitfeld) ground this fear.

Another potential unintended consequence of the LFLs is decreasing visits to public libraries, which could provide officials seeking to defund them with evidence that they are no longer relevant or necessary. One LFL steward and avid reader remarked that she had not used her local public library since 2014 because “I was using the Little Free Libraries” (Steward). Academics and librarians must conduct more research to determine what impact, if any, LFLs are having on visits to traditional public libraries. ConclusionLittle Free Libraries across the United States, and increasingly in other countries, have generated discussion, promoted collaboration between neighbours, and led to sharing. In other words, they have built communities. This was the intended consequence of the LFL movement. There, however, has also been unplanned community building in response to municipal threats to the structures due to right of way, safety, and planning ordinances. The more threatening concern is not the municipal ordinances used to block LFL development, but rather the trend of privatisation of publicly provided services. While people are celebrating the community built by the LFLs, caution must be exercised lest central institutions of the public and community, traditional public libraries, be lost. Academics and communities ought to consider not just impact on their local community at the street level, but also wider structural concerns so that communities can foster many “great good places”—the Little Free Libraries and traditional public libraries as well.ReferencesAldrich, Margaret. “Big Milestone for Little Free Library: 50,000 Libraries Worldwide.” Little Free Library.

The Systematic Construction of Lawfulness of Processing Employees’ Personal Information Under the Chinese Personal Information Lawthe Systematic Construction of Lawfulness of Processing Employees’ Personal Information Under the Chinese Personal Information Law,2022,"With the rapid development and common use of digital technologies in China’s workplace, employers’ right to monitor and direct employees has often been abused, raising a number of disputes over infringement of employees’ right to privacy. Thus China must urgently develop an appropriate approach to balancing these two conflicting interests. However, there is at present no coherent and uniform regime governing protection of employees’ personal information in China, while the primary legal source on which employers can rely is the latest Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which relies on a “three-dimensional model” to determine the lawfulness of processing employees’ personal information. In addition to employee consent, it adds “necessity for the conclusion or performance of a employment contract” and “necessity for conducting human resource management” as lawful bases for processing. Concerns, however, have been expressed regarding the reasonableness and effectiveness of the “three dimensional model” in PIPL. First, it is problematic for PIPL to rely so heavily on employee consent on the legal and practical fronts. Second, when processing on the other two lawful bases, it is unclear whether this relieves employers of the duty of notification and if so, how to safeguard employee’s right to know. Third, the ambiguous standard of “necessity” needs to be clarified.This article argues that China should learn a number of things from EU and US law. In relation to employee consent, the Chinese approach should learn from the EU approach instead of US approach. Since EU approach, which does not, in general, regard employee consent as a lawful basis and can leave the other two lawful bases for processing as an alternative to employee consent, is better to overcome the failure of employee consent and meet the need for employee subordination and employer control in China. In contrast, the US law, which deems employee consent to be an absolute general defense to the tort of privacy violation and adopts the employer favoritism approach to to balancing these two conflicting interests, is not appropriate for China. In relation to the scope of necessity, three tests taken from the EU and US approaches should be taken into account by the Chinese courts. In addition, when processing based on the other two lawful bases, it still needs to take account of and safeguard employee’s right to know by labor union or employee representatives under Chinese Labor Contract Law, which is very helpful to overcome employers’ arbitrariness. Ultimately, these changes would produce a better balance between employee right to privacy and employer need for subordination and control.","['systematic', 'construction', 'lawfulness', 'processing', 'employees’', 'personal', 'information', 'under', 'chinese', 'personal', 'information', 'lawthe', 'systematic', 'construction', 'lawfulness', 'processing', 'employees’', 'personal', 'information', 'under', 'chinese', 'personal', 'information']"
"Articulation, or the persistent problem with explanation",2024,"Sociologists have long argued that explanation, as a form of knowledge, has serious limitations when it comes to understanding society. The case against explanation is one of the field's founding ideas, it is literally a foundational idea. It was by rejecting causalist forms of explanation that had been developed in the natural sciences that 19th century scholars and activists that we today call sociologists succeeded in articulating a distinctive realm of reality with relative autonomy from the state, the economy and the family: society (Wagner, 2000). Key to their achievement was the argument that the phenomenon of society is fundamentally different from nature. Scientists at the time expected nature to obey eternally valid laws, but society has a number of features that challenge this assumption. Social actors formulate norms and rules to justify their actions and to make sense of social reality. This means that norms and rules themselves may play an active role in the transformation of social reality. Society, in other words, is marked by reflexivity. Of course, a lot has happened since the 19th century and this very notably includes unrelenting efforts by social scientists to create forms of explanation that are capable of taking reflexivity into account. Yet problems with explanation have continued to make themselves felt in the social sciences and humanities. The problem, in a nutshell, is that explanation sets up the relation between social science and its object, society, in terms of representation, but the relation between knowledge about society and social reality is fundamentally an interactive one: the creation of knowledge about society far more often than not involves intervention in society. The creation of social scientific knowledge can rarely, if ever, by considered a purely representational affair. This obtains for practically all forms of knowledge about society - and as we shall see, about nature as well - but it causes specific problems for the explanation of social phenomena. Let me give an example from contemporary social science, broadly defined. Some years ago computational social scientists published research that showed that the high levels of political polarization that can be observed among communities on Facebook cannot be explained by the role of social media algorithms in the promotion of content. As they put it: ""individual choices, more than algorithms, limit exposure to attitude-challenging content"" (Bakshy et al., 2015, p. 1131). Such a claim asks us to accept a number of assumptions, most notably, that it is possible to disentangle the influence of individual user choices on news consumption on Facebook from the influence of platform settings such as the structure of news feeds.1 This assumption may or may not ultimately be methodologically convincing. But in grounding its main finding in this distinction, this study distracts attention from a more fundamental phenomenon: that ""choice"" in online platform settings is socio-technically constituted in a highly distinctive way, involving clicks on links that are dynamically served up by the platform based on social network analysis, among others. This type of ""choice"" presents a very different form of action as compared to say, choosing what article to read in a paper newspaper. However, and this is the key point, affirming such ontological complexity would no doubt be seen as reducing the ""strength"" of the explanation offered. As the recently deceased constructivist sociologist Aaron Cicourel (1964) pointed out many decades ago, to draw attention to the participation of the underlying apparatus of social research - in this case, Facebook data categories such as ""clicks"" and ""friends"" - in the construction of social reality is to challenge the representational understanding of social science in general and of explanatory social science in particular. Explanation requires the relation between social categories and social reality to be stable and one-way (unidirectional): it requires that social scientific categories first and foremost refer back to social reality. When the apparatus of social research is shown to interfere in the realities it purports to measure, it is clear that this does not quite obtain. A persistent problem with explanation, then, is that its validity seems to depend on the bracketing, externalising or trivialising of dynamics of reflexivity. If the proponents of the idea that ""social science is explanation, or it is nothing"" would get their way, and social science indeed would offer only explanations, and nothing else, this would surely end up restricting our capacity to interrogate the manifold ways in which social categories interact with social realities. However, most people who are interested and/or trained in sociology are well aware of the phenomenon of reflexivity, of the power of social categories to shape social reality. So why do so many sociologists today favour explanation over other, more open-ended forms of knowledge, like ethnographic description and theory-driven interpretation, methodologies which have been specifically designed to enable interrogation of the interactive relations between social categories and social realities (Krause, 2016)? I would like to argue here that there is another layer to this phenomenon of interactivity, one that has less to do with how norms, categories and methods shape reality, and more with how social science achieves what Norbert Elias (2011) called adequacy to social reality. For me, there is a danger that lurks in the commitment to ""explanation"" that is related but different from the problem that it legitimates or encourages indifference to reflexivity, the danger namely that it distracts from a key task and purpose of social science: articulation. The slogan ""explanation or nothing"" makes me think of a remark by the German media scholar Erhard Schüttpelz who once reminded me that ""all of our concepts are going downhill all of the time."" At the time, we were speaking about the concept of ""media bias,"" and the ways in which understandings of such bias developed in the 1970s are no longer adequate, though still highly relevant, to today's digital society with its algorithmic organisation of content, where frames are consolidated through post-discursive, automated, processes of selective circulation. I continue to find Schüttpelz comment helpful more generally speaking, as it draws attention to a brute fact that deeply affects the relation between the social sciences and society, which is that the world, society, is continously changing, and this changing world continuously renders our existing vocabularies, and forms of explanation, deficient. In other words, we should expect our existing social theories to be losing their adequacy to our present social reality. Schüttpelz slogan reminds us that many of the phenomena that it is our job to understand are invisible or badly named, and are difficult to even observe let alone measure. Take the example of the security state, which in its current technological form - which is marked by the deployment of a data-intensive apparatus of monitoring and control - developed in the post-war period, from the 1960s onwards. As the French sociologist Dominique Linhardt (2008) has shown, the very observability of the security state during this period was dependent on targetted interventions in society: it partly depended on the interventions of militants such as the Rote Armee Fraktion in Germany and Provo in the Netherlands whose demonstrations brought the police out onto the streets for all to see. It was these interventions that rendered the phenomeon of the security state publicly visible, putting the repressive apparatus of the state monitoring activists onto the front pages of newspapers. But the observability of this type of information-based security state also depended on the invention of a new kind of sociology, which had to rework its concepts of power, in order to be able to demonstrate the significance of the technological security apparatus to the structuring of wider societal relations between population and state during this period. The point is, in a case like this, it is clear that both a phenomenon in society - the security state - and the categories we use to understand this and associated phenomena - state power - underwent transformation during that relevant period. This is not a context in which ""explanation"" works very well. To ""explain"" the security state requires the very phenomenon to be observable and identifiable in the first place, and a lot of work has to be done before we get to that point: the work of articulation. If we go along with Erhard Schüttpelz and recognise that events in the world render our ways of knowing deficient all the time, then it is clear that our work as sociologists must be re-constructive, we will need to be able to revise and rethink our categories, so we remain capable of naming phenomena in the world adequately, so that we can make them count. To give another example from my own field: when in the 1980s feminist technology studies developed the notion of ""invisible labour"" through fieldwork studies in workplaces like airports and offices (Star, 1991; Suchman, 1996), they transformed the wider concept and understanding of innovation. At the time, innovation was a restrictive notion - and it still is - which allocates a disproportionate amount of agency to the engineers who create technology, while defining the rest of us, workers and consumers, as more or less passive ""users."" Feminist studies of invisible labour in technology-mediated work used ethnographic description to demonstrate how often female workers accomplished tasks - performing flight checks, copying documents - that were later acribed to the smooth running of ""technology."" It was these descriptions of invisible labour that allowed this phenomenon to be named and defined. Only then could the work begin of incoporating sensibility to unrecognised work into the social study of innovation and its ""apparatus of explanation,"" and gain the efficacy it has today, for example, in the form of a critical exposé of the invisible labelling that workers in Kenya, India and other countries perform, so that ""generative AI"" can do well at image recognition (Catanzariti et al., 2021). To emphasise articulation as a key task and purpose of social inquiry is certainly not to imply that explanation is without value. Finding ways to measure the prevalence of invisible labour in society so as to be able to demonstrate its existence, explain its workings, and connect its persistence with wider underlying dynamics in the technological economy, is crucial. The problem, that is, is not with explanation as such, it is with the ""or nothing"" bit in the slogan above. The adequacy of our explanations to the world is dependent on the prior work of articulation, and it is this dependency that is at risk of being disregarded when it is suggested that explanation is all we need. An important part of the task of social science is to develop vocabularies, formulate categories, cultivate sensibilities, so as to render ever-changing phenomena in society observable, explorable, and communicatable. To name, to formulate, to label, takes us halfway to understanding. It is to draw what Alfred Schutz (1970) calls the ""isohypses of relevance,"" enabling some entites, some dimensions to stand out, to gain traction, in our engagement with the world, while submerging others. This is the work of articulation, as opposed to explanation. Without it, our explanatory apparatus will not just keep going down hill. Its adequacy will eventually be lost. There is an odd irony in the suggestion that sociologists should today consider putting all their eggs in the basket of ""explanation."" We are living at a time in which the natural sciences are finally beginning to come to terms with the interactivity of science, as they grapple with the Anthropocene. Today, more and more colleagues in the natural and technical sciences are gripped by the realization that science has intervened in and indeed harmed and damaged the world in ways to which scientific epistemology previously rendered scientists blind. Representationalism places on science the methodological requirement to regard as external to the scientific mission - which is to represent reality - how its apparatus of representation impacts the world. Representationalism is part of what enabled scientists to cultivate indifference to how their work transformed the world physically, socially, materially, environmentally: think of the stress experienced by lab animals and lab technicians (Friese & Latimer, 2019); the PFAS molecules which are today found in ground and sea water, and known to cause cancer, and which for decades were represented in terms their qualities of ""water-proofing"" and ""stick-resistance"" (for carpets). There is a more complex story to be told here about the relation between science and innovation, but the problem is similar to the problem of methodologically ordained dis-interest in socio-technical complexity that I mentioned in the introduction. Damaging effects produced by the apparatus of scientific research on the world used to be referred to as ""unintended consequences,"" but they are today understood by an increasing number of natural scientists as a siginificant factor in the degradation of nature, animal and human life. Isn't it odd that at the very time that scientists are beginning to recognise interactivities between science and the natural and social world, we are debating whether the primary role of the social sciences is to represent the world? Why? Why would a sociologist today accept that ""explanation"" is the only serious game in science, at a time when the sciences themselves are finally waking up to the manifold problems with ""explanation"" as a scientific framework? Granted, one of the benefits of ""explanation"" is that it has a strong ""theory of change"" associated with it. Explanation offers us a tight, sequential relation between knowledge and action, whereby the representation of an underlying reality creates the basis for transformative intervention in society, for social change. By comparison, a theory of knowledge that puts articulation centre stage offers a far more contingent, multi-factored and messy view of how change happens in the world, and it requires an openness of inquiry to engage and continually attune understanding to a changing social world. My sense is that it is the strength and simplicity of the associated theory of change that the methodological paradigm of ""explanation"" promises, that explains much of its attractiveness to sociologists today. Perhaps it can be seen, too, as a response to the utterly restrictive expectations that are placed today on the social sciences. Explanation is able to offer knowledge of long-term processes and enduring underlying causes, which is badly needed in the face of muliplying social, environmental and political crises. It offers a robust alternative to the instrumental conception of social research, which is increasingly imposed on us by state and industry, and which requires that social science delivers on short-term policy needs and value for money, and which can seem to value knowledge of society only to the extent that it is able to produce demonstrable changes in behaviour and bottom-lines (Kelly & McGoey, 2018). However, precisely at this moment, when the social sciences face challenges from multiple fronts - from short-termist expectations of impact, to policy-makers endearement with behavioural science as provider of readily applicable solutions, and the eagerness of some computational scientists to serve as the go-to provider of ""social explanations"" - it is important that we don't feel pressured to retreat into the narrow methodological frame of ""explaination"" and to risk inadvertingly reasserting a false hierarchy between explaination and articulation. There is a vital difference between an instrumental social science whose value and legitimacy primarily derive from its ability to service short-term policy needs, and a sociology capable of affirming interactivity between social science and the social world. This difference needs to be urgently clarified, if we are to avoid sleepwalking into a future of shrinking sociological repertoires, and importantly, if we are to get better at engaging, informing and indeed leading the debate that is finally getting underway across the sciences, about what it means to affirm interactivity between knowledge and its objects, not only ethically and politically, but methodologically speaking. To sum up, my real disagreement today is with the ""or nothing"" element in the idea that social science is explanation or it is nothing. I don't have a problem at all with explanation as a form of social knowledge taking its rightful place among other forms of knowledge in the social sciences. I have a problem with the suggestion that explanation is superior to these other forms, and that other ways of knowing society need to make way for it. My problem is with the hubris of a social science that assumes that the work of articulation, of making phenomena perceptible, can be economised on. It cannot. Explanation depends on articulation: we can only posit and define phenomena and their underlying causes once the struggle to name, to make count - the struggle for the existence of a category - has been fought. The apparatus of explanation that we all rely on - the categories, standards, measures and data formats that together constitute the apparatus of social science - is always at risk of perpetuating outdated, inadequate categories. To the extent that ""explanation"" assumes that the work of articulation - what matters? how to name this? - can be taken for granted, it risks to become complicit in eroding conditions for articulation. The ""or nothing"" in the above motion wrongly implies that the renewal of our vocabularies, concepts and methods is of secondary importance. I would therefore like to turn the proposition around. ""Social science is reflexive or it is nothing."" Sociology has impressive analytic and methodological resources at its disposal for creating knowledge under conditions of interactivity, and it is this capacity that should be celebrated and requires our endorsement, not just for the sake of advancing the social sciences but all sciences. Social studies of science and technology have shown how interactivity does not just operate on the plane of categorization, but also through indicators, infrastructures and indeed the world, as measures from GPD to the aforementioned social media ""clicks"" and the calorie system have contributed to the production of harmful realities in their distorted-mirror image. But, ultimately, affirming such interactivity effects does not require making explanation the enemy. Indeed, there are forms of explanation that take the changing relations between social reality and the categorization of social reality as their object, as in the work of Norbert Elias (1998). In his historical sociological studies of how figurations change, Elias advocated a processual, internalist mode of explanation in which ""a change in the figuration [can be] explained partly by the endogenous dynamics of the figuration itself."" (p. 131) What I am saying is that our categories, the apparatus that we rely on to render social phenomena explorable and analysable, can be understood as a notable part of these figurations. As sociologists have pointed out since at least the early 20th Century: what entities and forces are relevant to the formation - and de-formation - of a given social phenomenon is partly at stake in the process of its articulation. What Im saying is that this at-stakeness extends to our concepts, our categories and the measures that social science relies on. Their fates, too, partly depend on ""what happens,"" and cannot be taken for granted.

The Changing Scenario of Occupational Health in India,2024,"INTRODUCTION With the ever-increasing population and subsequent increased demand for goods and services, the Indian industrial sector is rapidly progressing to soon be the next super power in the field of trade and manufacturing. There has been a substantial increase in the number of manufacturing industries over the past two decades reaching an all-time high of 246,504 units in 2020 as compared to 93,166 units in the year 1983, as per data made available by the Ministry of Statistics and Implementation, Government of India.[1] Industrialization implies a substantial amount of employment to be generated in the near future in the organized as well as the unorganized sector. With increased employment comes increased safety concerns of a larger workforce exposed to occupational hazards, necessitating heightened focus on health-related interventions and safety measures and requirement of trained occupational health professionals to ensure worker safety and well-being. Allocating resources for expanding healthcare infrastructure, hiring more personnel and acquiring necessary equipment are important amid the growing target population. It is important to implement streamlined processes and technology to optimize resource utilization.[2] Occupational health physicians play an important role to ensure equitable access to occupational health services for all workers, especially those in remote or rural areas through mobile clinics/telemedicine, or through integration with primary health care systems such as the government health services, general practitioner sectors through public–private partnerships, and collaborating with private entities for funding or resources.[3] The current day occupational health scenario in India The number of consultants in the field of occupational health and safety is presently low in comparison to most other specialties owing to poor coverage of the subject in the medical curriculum of the country, which in turn results in poor awareness of the scope of this area. However, this scenario has been changing over the past decade due to increased awareness and demand for occupational health and safety services. This can be attributed to the increased literacy rate among workers, awareness regarding rights of workers, reporting of workplace accidents, and understanding the importance of expert opinions to prevent workplace accidents and promote well-being of the workforce. The use of social media and easy access to information have also played a major role in creating awareness about this specialty among medical professionals.[4] With easy access to information and exchange of information through international co-operation, the understanding of occupational hazards and their health implications has improved. Journalism has advanced over the years with prompt media coverage, highlighting workplace accidents and the necessity for safety measures. The ability of the media to address a larger audience has brought about a major change in the field of occupational health and safety in the country. Knowledge sharing via various digital platforms sitting in their comfort zones in addition to the existing ways among healthcare professionals has increased. Moreover, the regulatory framework has been strengthened with stricter enforcement. There is a greater emphasis on compliance to occupational health and safety standards. Occupational safety and health code 2020 has recently been passed by the Indian Parliament. There has been a change in workplace culture and an advancement in occupational healthcare infrastructure. Shift toward promoting a culture of safety and well-being at the workplace with initiatives focusing on employee wellness and mental health at work is in place. Industry-led safety campaigns for hazard education by competent personnel are in place. Newer technologies are being used for workplace risk assessment, monitoring of workplace hazards, health surveillance, and safety protocols.[5] Numerous studies and research work have been published by occupational health experts on various occupational health hazards and other issues in Indian industries, thus increasing awareness among the medical professionals. There are dedicated journals addressing occupational health issues in the country like the 'Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine' (IJOEM). Institutions and organizations addressing occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety in the country is currently dealt by the following institutions: The Central Labour Institute, Directorate General Factory Advice Service, and Labour Institute (DGFASLI) advise the Ministry of Labor and Employment on matters related to safety, health, and welfare of workers in factories. Regional Occupational Health Centers like the Employees State Insurance Corporation address health-related eventualities that the workers are generally exposed to, such as sickness, maternity, temporary or permanent disability, and occupational disease or death due to work-related injury, resulting in loss of wages or earning capacity, total or partial. The National Institute of Occupational Health, under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), conducts research work and trainings and provides consultancy services in occupational health. The Public Health Foundation of India conducts research and advocacy programs dedicated to occupational health issues. It collaborates with various stakeholders to promote workplace safety and health awareness. The Indian Association of Occupational health (IAOH), which was founded in the year 1948, with a membership of over 3000 occupational health physicians, industrial hygienists, and HSE professionals conducts periodic academic and scientific lectures, symposia, and workshops. Annual Scientific Conferences are organized for HSE professionals working at a range of industries. IAOH collaborates with national and international institutions in the field of occupational health and safety. The National Safety Council of India aims at promoting safety consciousness among workers to reduce work place accidents. Green triangle society, a Goastate-based NGO, rendering integrated services in occupational health, safety, and environment for more than past two decades is an aspiring example worth emulating for addressing the issues through a facilitatory approach. Education and training in occupational health Few courses and fellowships are presently available in the country for those seeking to be an occupational health physician in the country. The Associate Fellow of Industrial Health (AFIH) course is a 3-month full time course regulated by DGFASLI and is mandatory for all doctors working at hazardous industries per the Factories Act, 1948. The Certificate Course in Industrial Health (CIH) is offered by the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH). The Post Graduate Diploma in Environment and Occupational health (PGDEOH) was conducted by the Indira Gandhi Open National University and certificate course in 'Health, Safety and Environment Management' by the public Health Foundation of India. Full-time courses in occupational health accredited by medical or health-related regulatory bodies like the National Medical Council of India are not available yet, and occupational health is only a small part of Community Health, a broad specialty which covers everything from epidemiology to nutrition, infectious diseases, and health planning/management.[6] The absence of globally recognized courses might limit the professional growth and global mobility of aspiring occupational health practitioners from India. It is the need of the hour to conduct regular workshops and training sessions on occupational health and safety using tailored programs addressing diverse occupational risks to orient healthcare providers to understand occupational health better and serve the ever-growing workforce in the country. Visual materials like info graphics and videos can be used to provide health education across different literacy levels. Use of digital systems for efficient management of health data as well as use of data analytics to identify trends in health outcomes is of utmost importance. Career opportunities in occupational health in India The career opportunities available in occupational health in India include working in the corporate sector, government, and public sector or as independent consultants. The jobs in the corporate sector include occupational health physicians across industries such as manufacturing, IT, construction, and pharmaceuticals. The job profile of the occupational health physician would include interventions to ensure employee well-being to design wellness programs and manage occupational health-related issues. There are opportunities as occupational health specialists in healthcare institutions like hospitals, clinics, and healthcare organizations; these specialists focus on diagnosing and managing work-related injuries, illnesses, and providing preventive care. Jobs in the government and public sector include those in the government regulatory bodies to oversee occupational health regulations, policy-making, and enforcement or in research institutions like NIOH for conducting studies, developing interventions, and generating evidence-based practices. Those with academic interest can work as trainers and educators with teaching positions in universities, colleges, or specialized training centers offering courses in occupational health and safety or as program coordinators managing educational programs focusing on occupational health training and workshops. Other options include consultancy and freelancing as independent consultants offering services to multiple industries as advisors on occupational health compliance, risk assessment, and health management.[7] As freelance trainers/writers, one can conduct workshops, write articles, or develop training modules on occupational health. Working with NGOs or on collaborative projects with international organizations focused on occupational health research, policy advocacy, or capacity-building programs is another available option. Entrepreneurship with establishment of occupational health clinics offering specialized occupational health services to organizations and individuals is a great option in the field of occupational medicine. Some consultants are working on developing tech-based solutions for occupational health monitoring, safety training, or data analytics. CONCLUSION As India's economic trajectory propels it toward global prominence, the significance of occupational health cannot be overstated. In the tapestry of India's economic evolution, the role of occupational health emerges as a fundamental thread, woven intricately into the fabric of progress. Occupational health emerges not merely as a sector of employment but as a linchpin in the nation's journey toward sustainable growth and inclusive development. By harnessing the potential of its workforce and fostering a culture of health and safety, India paves the way for a future where prosperity is measured not only in economic terms but also in the well-being and resilience of its people.","['changing', 'scenario', 'occupational', 'health', 'india']"
Designing Adult Skills and Literacy Program for College of Lifelong Education,2016,"Literacy has been an important issue in instruction and learning. In past, literacy indicated the ability to read and write a simple sentence (UNESCO, 2008), but literacy includes all around skills to access knowledge thorough technology and the ability to access complex context in a practical sense. That is why different types of literacy has also appeared such as media literacy, computer literacy, information and digital literacy when new technology emerges. As an expansion of literacy issue, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) surveyed adults between the ages of 16 and 65 in 23 countries for measuring their cognitive and workplace skills required for economic activity and participating in society in 2012 using the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). PIAAC consists of literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environment for measuring adult skills. The 2012 survey results indicated that Korea showed the largest discrepancies in adult skills between younger and older adults on PIAAC scales. In other words, young Koreans aged between 16 and 24 outperformed in adult skills than other countries while old Korean``s adult skills aged between 45 and 65 are lower than average scores of OECD countries. This implies that it is necessary to improve adult skills of middle aged adults for successfully implementing lifelong education. Recently, the Ministry of Education of Korea released ``the National action plans for launching College of lifelong education`` in order to encourage those who want to get a job immediately after high school with a life plan to head back to college later. The purpose of this national plan is to reduce youth unemployment and to increase in the ratio of economically active young population. If high school graduates those who want to get a job immediately after graduation have opportunities to enjoy high quality college education anytime later, they are not reluctant to have occupation instead of going to college. Since the applicants of College of lifelong education has different qualifications from those who go to college right after high school graduation with college scholastic ability test scores, it is necessary to monitor their academic training readiness and to provide a makeup program for ensuring their readiness. For this reason, one requirement for launching College of lifelong education is to provide basic academic ability enhancement programs for overcoming educational exclusion problem. In this session, the presenters will discuss how to develop the academic ability enhancement programs for those who experienced educational exclusion based on PIAAC survey results. It will include the explanations of types of literacies and adult skills required for adult learners returning to college and the discussion about effective instructional strategies for designing the academic ability enhancement programs.","['designing', 'adult', 'skills', 'literacy', 'program', 'college', 'lifelong', 'education']"
The Importance of Cyber Resiliency in the Modern Utility: the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District Journey,2024,"The Importance of Cyber Resiliency in the Modern Utility: the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District JourneyAbstractResiliency in the Modern Utility is essential and multi-faceted. Traditionally resiliency in utilities focused on operations, and over time it has grown to include finance, supply, workforce, and climate impacts among numerous considerations. In today's digital world, utilities rely on enterprise management systems, computerized maintenance management systems, SCADA, and the internet, which are integrated into our daily lives and workplace. In addition to this reliance, the threats to our systems have never been greater. The threat of cyber-attack today is a business, and cyber security an ever-increasing need. The purpose if this presentation is to outline Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District's (MSD) journey to build a utility not just focused on cyber security, but cyber resilience. St. Louis MSD is a large regional sewer authority, serving over 1.3 million customers in St. Louis City and County. Technology supports over a thousand employees serving headquarters, seven treatment plants, 280 pumpstations, and collection system maintenance of 6,000 miles of pipe. This was a multi-year journey that has evolved and continually adapted to the fast pace and changing digital landscape. This paper will describe MSD's recognition of the need to mitigate cyber risk, the decision to launch on this journey and methods to identify and mitigate the threats to cyber resilience. The areas of focus were both on physical threats and virtual threats. Solutions included evaluating data center, network operations, applications, IT asset management, mobile technology, connectivity, and security. MSD focused on industry best practices and utilizing accepted security frameworks to identify risks and prioritize the controls. Control measures focus on prevention, detection, response, and recovery. MSD will discuss the phases of this journey, with an initial phase focused on physical hardening and redundancy, actions included data center colocation, network redundancy and monitoring. Subsequent phases focus on IT applications, cyber security, and associated policies. This journey was not always perfect, MSD will discuss its success and setbacks, including the disappointment in 2020 when the District failed a penetration test even after enacting new policies and controls and how that led to digging deeper into improving internal practices and training. These efforts ultimately lead to success in future audits. In addition, we will discuss the scramble and shift in the digital landscape created by the pandemic and new norms and challenges of a remote workforce. This led to an increased focus on mobile assets, mobile device security and internet redundancy. We will discuss societies shift to the cloud has changed MSD's policy on software selection, the need of on-prem infrastructure, disaster recovery site and has created new opportunities and challenges for cyber resilience. Lastly, we will discuss lessons learned on this journey and how we see the landscape continuing to evolve.This paper was presented at the WEF/AWWA Utility Management Conference, February 13-16, 2024.SpeakerSprague, JonathonPresentation time11:00:0011:30:00Session time10:30:0012:00:00SessionUtility Resilience and ReliabilitySession number17Session locationOregon Convention Center, Portland, OregonTopicCybersecurityTopicCybersecurityAuthor(s)Sprague, JonathonAuthor(s)J.

NON-CORPORATE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES USAGE BY EMPLOYEES FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES,2024,"Статья посвящена изучению использования общедоступных социальных сетей занятым населением трудоспособного возраста Свердловской области. Информационной базой выступают два социологических исследования, проведенных автором в мониторинговом режиме в конце 2021 и осенью 2023 годов. Всего было опрошено 301 человек в первом исследовании и 268 – во втором; исследование проводилось среди городских жителей, проживающих в Екатеринбурге, средних и малых городах. Результаты исследования показали, что у подавляющего большинства опрошенных имеются аккаунты в социальных сетях, и проводят много времени в сетях. Выявлены наиболее популярные в регионе социальные сети и динамика их использования. Далее в процессе исследования были определены варианты активностей в сетях. При этом исследование показало, что почти половина работников в 2021 и почти три четверти опрошенных в 2023 году используют внекорпоративные социальные сети для просмотра обучающих роликов и фото, читают обучающие посты. Ответ на другой вопрос показал, что при внедрении новых цифровых технологий на рабочем месте работники разбираются сами или опять же смотрят обучающие материалы в Интернете. The article is devoted to the study of the social networking sites usage by the employed working age population in the Sverdlovsk region. The information base is two monitoring sociological studies conducted by the author at the end of 2021 and the autumn of 2023. 301 people were interviewed in the first study and 268 in the second; the study was conducted among urban residents living in Yekaterinburg, medium and small towns. The results of the study showed that the vast majority of respondents have accounts on social networking sites and spend a lot of time online. The most popular social networks in the region and their usage dynamics have been identified. Further, options for activities on social networking sites were identified in the research process. At the same time, the study showed that almost half of employees in 2021 and almost three quarters in 2023 use non-corporate social networking sites to watch training videos and photos, and read training posts. The answer to another question showed that when introducing new digital technologies at the workplace, employees figure it out themselves or, again, watch training materials on the Internet.","['non-corporate', 'social', 'networking', 'sites', 'usage', 'employees', 'professional', 'purposes']"
Transformation of the labor market and employment in conditions of personnel shortage,2024,"The conducted study concludes the following. (1) The labor market of modern Russia is experiencing an active development of flexible forms of employment, which are reflected in the socio-economic processes of the regions and the legal framework of the Russian Federation. The law On Employment in the Russian Federation defines the legal field for phenomena and concepts previously not included in it (selfemployment, platform employment, etc.). Thus, the labor market and government labor services indicate the development of alternative, flexible employment of the population. This makes it possible to legalize labor activities of a number of categories of the population, in particular those working on digital platforms and creating their own workplaces. (2) Trends in regional demographic indicators determine the scale of employment and the specifics of personnel shortages in times during the period of personnel shortage. Today, much attention is paid to such socio-demographic groups as young people and the older generation. According to the UN, aging is becoming one of the most significant transformations of the 21st century. The author’s position is to continue to identify socio-demographic groups of the country’s population that are capable of making up for the decline in labor force. (3) The implementation of the concept of a flexible labor market requires expanding the provision of flexible labor regimes to the population. The basis for this concept, which has been studied since the 1970s, is the transition to more flexible, functionally individualized and non-standard forms of employment. The main advantage of such a labor market is the ability to adequately respond to changes in prices, demand and supply of labor resources and create the required quantity, quality and price of labor. (4) An effective measure to solve the personnel shortage is economic incentives and social conditions that can attract and retain qualified workers. In industrially advanced sectors that meet the tasks of scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation, the combination “high-tech equipment = highly qualified personnel” is more necessary, which will help ensure the scientific and technological development of Russian regions. While the service sector is the most flexible to the norms of a flexible labor market due to its labor-intensive nature, it largely depends on the application of management methods, quality optimization, organizational issues, and socio-psychological stimulation. (5) A systematic monitoring of the labor market is required at a regional and sectoral level. The analysis showed that, despite the general trends in the transformation of the labor market and employment in the Russian Federation, there are differences in territorial manifestations and areas of economic activities. The findings of the work may be useful to scientists, specialists, and politicians studying the problems of the labor market and employment in conditions of personnel shortages.","['transformation', 'labor', 'market', 'employment', 'conditions', 'personnel', 'shortage']"
"Indoor radon monitoring for occupational health reinforcement in Portugal: compliance, prevention, and technological advancements",2023,"AbstractThis article highlights the relevance of indoor radon monitoring for occupational health protection, disease prevention, and compliance with safety regulations. Radon, a colorless, odorless, and tasteless radioactive gas, is a leading cause of lung cancer after tobacco smoking, and therefore in situ monitoring is fundamental to identify areas with high radon levels so that remediation measures must be implemented to reduce indoor exposure. The article gives an overview of the regulations in force in Portugal for indoor radon monitoring and identifies the responsibilities of different authorities and organizations in ensuring compliance with radiological protection requirements. It also outlines the legal framework for radon protection in Portugal, including the identification of reference levels for radon concentration in workplaces and dwellings, and the need to implement measures concerning indoor radon exposure reduction. Additionally, it is detailed the process of monitoring radon in indoor environments, including the selection of an appropriate measurement device and the necessary measurement time, and the need to inform and train workers about the risks associated with radon exposure. In short, this review provides information on the importance of radon monitoring and the measures required to ensure public safety.KEYWORDS: Radon exposureIot monitoringoccupational health protectionhealth and safety at work regulations AcknowledgementsThe author declare no further acknowledgements.Data availability statementData are available per on request to the corresponding author.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Informed consent statementNot applicable.Institutional review board statementNot applicable.Additional informationFundingThis work is a result of the project TECH – Technology, Environment, Creativity and Health, Norte-01-0145-FEDER-000043, supported by Norte Portugal Regional Operational Program (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

The technostress questionnaire: a pilot study,2021,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) represent one of the major drivers of economic growth and collective evolution, with positive repercussions on the world of labor. Despite several benefits, technology is substantially altering the nature and organization of work, posing possible psychosocial, organizational and ergonomic risks as outlined by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and current strategic documents of the European Commission. The novel COVID-19 pandemic has further accentuated the burden of the use of ICT, emphasizing the importance of occupational safety and health practices. Nevertheless, the topic of digital stress is not yet carefully considered in the Italian context. The purpose of this exploratory study is to create a new psychometric tool aimed at investigating the key dimensions of technostress. In particular, the psychometric properties of each scale (reliability and dimensionality) were preliminarily analyzed. The spread of ICT modifies the characteristics of traditional stressors (e.g. job demands) while contributing to the spread of new stressors (e.g. privacy and pervasiveness), leading to what is called ""technostress"". Since the first definition of technostress introduced by Brod (1984), the construct has been operationalized according to different perspectives and is now consensually recognized as a major threat to the health of workers. For the realization of the items and the identification of the areas of investigation, the concepts of stress, work-related stress and technostress were examined together with the main theoretical models and pre-existing psychometric tools. The items belonging to each dimension were then generated according to a deductive path. The qualitative analyses regarding content validity led to a total of 80 items and 15 scales (usefulness/usability, reliability, technology self-efficacy, role, multitasking, job control, job demands, pace of change, pervasiveness/work- life balance, privacy/monitoring, employability, supervisor support, colleague support, involvement and training) which were administered to a sample of 235 subjects. Reliability analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFA) (principal axis factoring (PAF) with suppression of factor loadings below 0.30 and promax rotation) were performed for each scale. The internal consistency analyses showed values ranging from fairly good (α = 0.60) to excellent (α = 0.88) depending on the scale, providing encouraging results for a future in-depth analysis of the instrument. The exploratory factor analyses provided good initial results, yielding to a two-factor solution only in the case of the “multitasking” scale. Given the exploratory nature of the study, the validation process was limited to the analysis of reliability and dimensionality. Future studies will need to further analyze the structure of the scales in order to identify which model best represents the constructs, using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) methods to evaluate the goodness of this version. The practical implications concern the creation of specific policies at company, sectoral and national level with a focus on an advanced workplace risk assessment. Once validated, the questionnaire could be used for tailor-made organizational diagnoses and targeted interventions.","['technostress', 'questionnaire:', 'pilot', 'study']"
"Worn Out: How Retailers Surveil and Exploit Workers in the Digital Age and How Workers Are Fighting Back By MadisonVan Oort, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2023. 245 pp. $30.00. ISBN: 978‐0‐26‐254493‐1. https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231199176",2024,"In a world where fast fashion is thriving, Madison Van Oort's 'Worn Out' is a timely and compelling contribution to debates around forms of surveillance in retail work and worker resistance in the digital age. An ethnography in its truest form, Van Oort goes beneath the surface of retail work and technology trends, witnessing firsthand how data and surveillance shape the lived experiences of marginalised, low-status workers in an increasingly exploitative industry. Van Oort documents the resilience and resistance of these workers as they push back and strive to reclaim their agency and improve their conditions. Through comprehensive interviews with frontline workers and labour activists, together with evidence from corporate conferences, 'Worn Out' exposes the exploitative dynamics of retail labour in the digital era, warning that, if left unchecked, such practices will likely intensify and exacerbate existing inequities. Against the backdrop of New York City, a global economic powerhouse and prominent hub for fast fashion, 'Worn Out' examines the practices within two of the city's largest fast fashion stores, aptly referred to in the book as 'McFashion' and 'Style Queen'. The book scrutinises the specific technologies which underpin and expedite the exploitative practices prevalent within fast fashion retail giants. These technologies facilitate the creation of just-in-time approaches by continuously gathering data on consumer behaviour and worker performance. Automated scheduling platforms streamline employee shifts based on real-time demand, while biometric timekeeping systems track attendance and productivity through fingerprint and facial recognition. Cashier performance metrics play their part, assessing efficiency of transaction speed and item scanning accuracy at checkouts, enabling management to pinpoint problems and hold workers accountable. Together, these digital instruments amplify the vulnerability and precarity of workers already dealing with heightened instability. The integration of such systems create a work environment characterised by unpredictable hours, intrusive, omnipresent surveillance, and intensified performance measures. Through this analytical framing, the book foregrounds intersectional themes and offers a nuanced comprehension of the retail labour landscape and its attendant demographic contours. By observing the resistance of marginalised workers, notably women and individuals from racial minority groups, Van Oort explicates the multifaceted dimensions through which struggles for racial, gender, and economic parity manifest. These intersectional struggles underscore the complexity of the fight against exploitation, revealing how multiple forms of oppression intersect and influence the dynamics of retail work and worker activism. Chapter 1 begins by tracing the history of fast fashion and explores how technological advancements, just-in-time manufacturing and global supply chains have dramatically accelerated production and distribution in retail. Van Oort examines how this relentless pursuit of efficiency and cost reduction has resulted in increasingly precarious labour conditions and demanding work environments. By situating fast fashion within the broader context of the global garment industry and the history of retail labour in the United States, Van Oort offers readers an initial insight into the socioeconomic ramifications. This contextualisation allows readers to grasp the interconnectedness of fast fashion with larger economic systems and historical labour practices, highlighting how its production and distribution methods have reshaped not only consumer culture but the livelihoods of workers worldwide. Through this lens, Van Oort authoritatively sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the complexities and inequalities inherent in the fast fashion industry, inviting readers to consider the broader implications beyond mere consumption. Although not addressed in this discussion, the rise of online shopping has significantly altered consumer behaviour, driven primarily by its convenience and accessibility. E-commerce platforms that provide rapid delivery and seamless purchasing are contributing to increased societal demand for instant gratification. This, in turn, places pressure on retailers to reduce costs, thereby perpetuating a cycle which increases worker instability and reinforces systemic inequalities. Van Oort's analysis invites a critical examination into how shifts in consumer behaviour and advancements in technological frameworks are contributing to these issues. Chapter 2 explores technology's influence, revealing how employers are increasingly harnessing its capabilities to manage workers' time even beyond the confines of the workplace. While this will not come as a surprise to readers, this revelation still proves disconcerting, even in today's digital age where such practices and blurring of work-life boundaries are commonplace. Focusing specifically on workforce management platforms and scheduling algorithms, Van Oort explains how companies use software to create unpredictable and unstable work schedules, which impact workers' lives and make it increasingly difficult for them to plan and organise their personal and work commitments. Beyond the conventional hiring criterion we have come to associate with retail work, such as interpersonal skills, sales acumen and product knowledge, the chapter emphasises the increasing significance of schedule flexibility as the overriding factor in employment decisions. By subjecting job seekers to unpredictable and arduous hiring processes, retail employers are testing the limits of individuals' willingness and tolerance to adapt to shifting schedules and demands even before formal employment begins. This process, as Van Oort argues, effectively 'weeds out' those who are less compatible with the demands of the position, reinforcing the fast fashion industry's preference for flexibility and adaptability above all else at the expense of workers' well-being, security, and their home and family lives. The emphasis on adaptability often compels employees to prioritise work over their personal commitments without question, exacerbating stress and instability as they attempt to juggle professional and domestic responsibilities. This harsh reality is particularly acute for part-time workers, who face these pressures despite the temporary nature of their roles. In Chapter 3, Van Oort delves into the digitisation of service work within the retail sector, examining how advancements in technology have radically transformed the labour process. She discusses the transition from the traditional emphasis on emotional labour and 'the managed heart' (Hochschild 1983) in service interaction—where workers regulate their emotions to meet customer expectations—to the concept of 'the automated heart'. This is reflective of the increasing extent to which automated systems like biometric time clocks and point-of-sale data are being implemented to streamline operations in retail, all the while intensifying the monitoring of worker performance and behaviour. Van Oort's observation of the spatial manifestation of shifting priorities in retail operations is significant. It suggests that there has been a tangible reconfiguration of physical space within retail stores, with the stockroom occupying a more prominent position and now often taking precedence over customer-facing areas. This shift reflects a strategic realignment focused on optimising inventory management and operational efficiency, frequently at the expense of improving the customer experience. Chapter 4 begins with Van Oort recounting her experience of attending a 'loss prevention' conference, where retailers are encouraged to invest in the latest surveillance technologies, such as in-store tracking systems, which have the potential to monitor workers both inside and outside the workplace. The chapter conveys some of the sobering consequences of these intrusive surveillance measures, leading to disciplinary action or dismissal in some cases. The policing of labour and dehumanising effects of these surveillance methods are given prominence in the chapter. Drawing interesting parallels between entertainment and surveillance, Van Oort highlights a broader societal shift facilitated by technologies like social media, which normalise and even encourage constant monitoring. This societal shift blurs the lines between 'connection and coercion', revealing how pervasive surveillance can become, with boundaries that seem almost limitless. The chapter ultimately prompts readers to rethink the ethical implications of surveillance and its profound and often detrimental effects on worker autonomy and privacy. Chapter 5 highlights the resistance strategies of retail workers against digital surveillance, and centres around two social movements, the Retail Action Project (RAP) and Black Lives Matter (BLM). The RAP addresses the negative impacts of surveillance on workers by advocating for labour rights, raising awareness and promoting policy changes. BLM intersects with these issues by underscoring how surveillance exacerbates racial and economic inequalities, shedding light on the broader systemic injustices at play. The two movements contribute to resistance efforts, with RAP concentrating on direct labour advocacy and BLM contextualising surveillance within wider issues of racial discrimination and economic exploitation. Van Oort's examination of the intersection between big data, surveillance technologies and power dynamics reveals the significant potential of critical data praxis. The chapter critiques how data practices can perpetuate existing inequalities and systemic injustices, particularly where retailers and law enforcement increasingly utilise comparable technologies for the purposes of surveillance and control, often sharing data with one another to ensnare suspected criminals. This underscores the often-hidden and sophisticated mechanisms through which power is exercised and sustained, and provides insights into the flow of data across institutional contexts and its impacts. From more subtle acts of resistance and attempts to game the system, to high-profile events and collective protest, the book has highlighted the creativity and resilience of workers as they navigate and push back against oppressive systems. Organised efforts, such as those led by RAP, involve strategic planning and coordination, collective mobilisation and comprehensive campaigns aimed at addressing and reforming the systemic issues associated with surveillance. The focus on the social movements offers some insight into the mechanics of successful organising and activism, as demonstrations and marches have generated support and shown how shared goals can galvanise individuals into action and inspire sentiments of solidarity among seemingly disparate groups. This a hopeful chapter providing a counterbalance to the bleakness and despair of previous discussions surrounding surveillance. It demonstrates that collective action and strategic alliances can lead to meaningful change, including increased worker protections, improved working conditions and a reduction in invasive practices. The chapter emphasises the power of mobilising marginalised communities to demand justice and accountability from the dominant institutions. In the concluding chapter, Van Oort reflects on the potential for change in the retail industry, emphasising the need for policy reforms to protect workers' rights and privacy in the digital age. Speculating on the future of work, and the eventual rollout of these digital technologies to other occupations, she advocates for essential policy changes and legislative action, as seen recently in California and New York City, including passing minimum wage increases and a ban on on-call scheduling, a practice which requires employees to remain available for work without guaranteed shifts. Here, Van Oort highlights the importance of worker solidarity in supporting such reforms, arguing that united efforts and contextualised approaches are likely to be more effective in cultivating a more just and equitable retail employment landscape. Ultimately, setting a precedent for other industries as digital technologies continue to evolve, rather than relying solely on technocratic solutions which tend to overlook the nuances of human experience and social dynamics. However, first, despite discussions on pay, conditions, and the enforcement of other protections, neither the final chapter nor the book addresses the crucial role of trade unions in this context. Inclusion of a discussion on trade unions could have provided additional insights into the extent of participation and how organised labour might bolster resistance efforts against technological surveillance and advocate for workers' rights. Second, it is important to acknowledge online consumption practices, where increasingly sophisticated algorithms now permit retailers to profile customers more precisely and influence their purchasing behaviour. These algorithms not only shape consumer choices but also affect labour practices behind the scenes. The consequences for workers are further restrictive features which leave them with diminished capacity or agency to resist this power. This final chapter provides a reflective and forward-looking conclusion, acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead, while also emphasising the potential for positive change. Rather than solely portraying a narrative of struggle and endless toil, the book offers hope through refreshing accounts of workers fighting back and the coping mechanisms they routinely utilise. It illustrates how workers are reclaiming space for themselves, a narrative that resonates beyond the retail sector to other industries where technological surveillance is rife and protections are limited or lacking. The vision for the future presented in the book is cautiously optimistic, advocating for continued vigilance and activism. It also recognises the difficulties of maintaining such efforts, particularly when workers are already exhausted and pushed to their limits by the exploitative system they remain tethered to. A criticism of the book is its limited scope in certain areas. For example, a comparative analysis with other industries experiencing technological surveillance and similar challenges could have further refined and enriched the discussion. Furthermore, addressing the role of trade unions might have offered a more comprehensive perspective on how organised labour could more effectively safeguard worker rights and enhance resistance efforts against these technological advances. By including such a discussion, the text would have highlighted the potential of unions to mobilise collectively and advocate for robust labour protections, thereby strengthening workers' ability to confront the complexities of these new digital advancements. Overall, Madison Van Oort's 'Worn Out' is a meticulously researched and passionately argued book that sheds light on the often-overlooked plight of retail workers in the digital age. Its unparalleled level of detail in accounts and observations exposes the precarious nature of retail work, identifying an urgent need for systemic and structural interventions to improve the conditions for workers in this space. Through an expert blend of theoretical analysis and personal narratives, the book achieves a balance of intellectual rigour and emotional resonance, making it essential reading for anyone interested in labour rights, digital surveillance and social justice in the modern workplace.","['worn', 'out:', 'retailers', 'surveil', 'exploit', 'workers', 'digital', 'workers', 'fighting', 'back', 'madisonvan', 'oort,', 'cambridge,', 'press,', '2023.', '$30.00.', 'isbn:', '978‐0‐26‐254493‐1.', 'https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231199176']"
Closing the mental health gap: transforming Pakistan's mental health landscape,2025,"Pakistan confronts a severe mental health crisis that compels urgent action. Mental disorders constitute a burgeoning global burden, with depression alone accounting for a staggering 4.4% of worldwide Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) [1]. A stark inequity persists, with over 90% in low-and middle-income nations lacking access to mental health treatment, compared to over 50% receiving care in high-income countries [2]. These disparities emanate from a chronic underinvestment, with lowincome nations allocating a mere fraction, less than 1% of health budgets, to mental health [3].Pakistan mirrors these global inequities. With a paucity of just 0.19 psychiatrists per 100,000 people [4], and an underwhelming allocation of only 0.4% of the health budget for mental health [5], Pakistan grapples to meet the needs of an estimated 24 million individuals requiring mental health services [6]. Depressive, anxiety, and schizophrenia disorders are the most prevalent [7]. Stigma surrounding mental illness remains an entrenched societal challenge [8].Currently, Pakistan's mental health system operates primarily through tertiary care hospitals in major cities, with minimal integration into primary healthcare. Mental health services are largely concentrated in psychiatric departments of teaching hospitals, creating geographic and economic barriers for rural populations. The existing system relies heavily on psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, with limited involvement of general physicians, community health workers, or other non-specialist providers. Mental health education is notably absent from school curricula, and workplace mental health programs are virtually non-existent. Digital mental health solutions remain unexplored within the public sector, while community-based mental health services are severely limited. The proposed transformations would mark significant departures from this status quo through: task-sharing with non-specialist providers instead of exclusive specialist care; integration of services into primary healthcare facilities rather than tertiary hospitals alone; establishment of community clinics in place of centralized urban facilities; leveraging digital technology where traditional in-person care is the norm; and engaging community partners versus the current isolated clinical approach.To expand access, the WHO recommends strategies such as task-sharing care to nonspecialist providers, integrating services into primary care and educational institutions, developing community clinics, leveraging digital technology, and engaging community partners [9]. Pakistan could adapt approaches like training primary care workers in mental health protocols, building teacher capacity for school-based services, deploying lay counselors with specialist supervision, offering telemental health services, and engaging community health workers in outreach efforts [10].[Figure 1] telepsychiatry and digital tools, and address social determinants through campaigns on gender equity [11]. Organizations like Pakistan Institute of Living and Learning (PILL) advocate for policies, build workforce capacity, and scale up culturallyadapted interventions [12]. Digital startups like Sehat Kahani use telepsychiatry and mobile applications to bridge the workforce gap [13].A critical component in addressing Pakistan's mental health crisis is the implementation of comprehensive anti-stigma campaigns [14]. These initiatives should operate at multiple levels based on established evidence [15]:A. Community-level interventions [14,15] To comprehensively address the crisis, Pakistan must invest in scaling up its mental health workforce through training more specialists and task-sharing to non-specialists [3,16]. Integrating services into primary care and establishing community mental health centers is crucial for decentralizing access [9,10]. Increasing public mental health spending, developing sustainable financing mechanisms, and strengthening governance and policies are imperative [5,16]. Research on effective, contextuallyappropriate interventions should guide investments [14]. Developing quality monitoring mechanisms is key to ensuring standards of care [9].Addressing social determinants through multi-sectoral coordination and whole-ofsociety approaches involving government, private sector, and civil society is vital [14].Sustained political commitment and strategic investments enabling universally accessible, community-based mental healthcare are crucial for realizing wellbeing for all Pakistanis [15,16].In essence, Pakistan confronts a formidable treatment gap with escalating rates of mental illness amid extreme limitations in mental health system capacity.Comprehensive strategies are necessitated, spanning workforce expansion, service integration into communities, increased financing, anti-stigma efforts, school interventions, research, quality assurance, and multi-sectoral coordination. While challenges are immense, prioritizing community-driven, decentralized mental health systems can ensure no individual is left behind on the path to greater wellbeing.","['closing', 'mental', 'health', 'gap:', 'transforming', ""pakistan's"", 'mental', 'health', 'landscape']"

Technologies for well-being: a grand challenge in connected health,2024,"In recent years, we have faced various social challenges, such as climate change, declining birth rates, aging populations, and population decline. As COVID-19 cause major changes in the way we work and live, ""well-being"" is attracting attention as a criterion for ""how to change"".Although no single definition of well-being has been established, the WHO defines well-being as ""Health is not the absence of disease or infirmity, but rather a state of physical, mental, and social well-being. Well-being includes quality of life and the ability of individuals and societies to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and purpose [1].We are conducting research and development aimed at realizing a well-being Information Society where all ""people"" can enjoy both physical and mental/spiritual health in a world in which the digital and real worlds will continue to merge. Improving well-being through connected health means using technology to improve health management and promote overall wellness. Connected health includes remote monitoring, telemedicine, personal health data, chronic disease management, behavioral health support, etc.By integrating these connected health strategies into daily life, individuals can benefit from more proactive, personalized, and efficient healthcare, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being.In this challenge, we will present our efforts in realizing well-being from different perspectives, including as people and society, and physical, mental, and spiritual health.A basic element of well-being is physical well-being. It is important to be healthy and to maintain good physical and mental health, and on this basis, values (symbiosis, empathy, sustainability, happiness, and prosperity) that enhance an individual's quality of life (QOL) will spread. However, humanity is currently experiencing a pandemic of a new type of coronavirus infection and the situation can be said to be one in which physical and mental well-being has been significantly reduced worldwide.Physical well-being is a basic element of wellness. It is believed that it is important to maintain good physical and mental health, and that good health can serve as a basis for cultivating values (symbiosis, empathy, sustainability, happiness, and prosperity) that enhance one's quality of life. The medical field is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from symptomatic therapy, which seeks cure after illness, to a world of care aimed at preventing illness in the first place (preventive medicine).An important perspective on well-being is behavior change, and the EU has been looking for effective behavior change for many years. In particular, behavior change technologies facilitated by wearable and Internet of Things devices are the domain of engineering and computer science. A particular focus is placed on a case study that examines the application of behavior change techniques to vital signs monitoring using wearables, underscoring the relevance and urgency of further research in this critical intersection of technology and human behavior [2]. The findings shed light on the promising role of wearables and IoT devices, hereinafter referred as connected health devices, in promoting positive behavior change and improving the overall well-being of individuals, and highlight the need for continued research and development in this area to realize the full potential of the technology for societal benefit. Connected health can support both physical and mental health through applications that offer therapy exercises [3,4], mood tracking [5][6][7], and stress management techniques [8,9]. Virtual support groups and counseling services can also play a role. Iin addition, connected health systems can aggregate and analyze personal health data, providing insights tailored to an individual's specific needs. This personalized approach can improve the effectiveness of treatments and lifestyle changes. Many connected health tools offer the ability to set health goals and track progress, which can help individuals stay motivated and make positive lifestyle changes These researches emphasize the key advantages of connected health devices for promoting behavior change, including their ability to provide personalized feedback, facilitate self-monitoring, incorporate gamification element. These features make the behavior change process more enjoyable, improve individuals' ability to their goals, and bring up a sense of community life and accountability.Gamification for elderly care has shown promise in influencing intentions to use new technologybased solutions [10]. Sestino and, D'Angelo found that the gamification-based digital therapeutics positively affected the elderly's intention to use, and this effect increased in magnitude as the elderly participants' socialization-seeking tendency increased, revealing the importance of socializationoriented strategies in stimulating the elderly's positive responses to technological tools.In addition, connected health management is also working to realize ""bio-digital twin technology,"" which enables the collection of a wide variety and large amount of bio-data from everyday life, modeling human physiological functions, and simulating future predictions that capture the characteristics of each individual.Sensor-based digital twins can assist sensors and connected health devices in automatically performing their monitoring tasks from the smart environment [11]. Adibi et al. investigated the integration of smart environments with sensor technologies, digital health capabilities, and location-based services, focusing on their impact on healthcare goals and outcomes. By analyzing the digital twin applications, they found that the sensor-based digital twins were a potential need to improve healthcare delivery and patient well-being.As mentioned earlier, the medical field is undergoing a paradigm shift from symptomatic treatment to disease prevention (preventive medicine). The use of advanced bio-information processing technology based on the digital mapping of an individual's bio-information will lead to well-being by avoiding unknown disease risks in advance, preventing disease by naturally inducing healthy behaviors, and supporting independent living in one's own way. For example, connected healthbased EHRs with machine learning technology to automate real-time patient-centered records more securely for authorized participants. Predictive healthcare systems are needed for private and public healthcare delivery to predict early diagnosis. Data is collected, and machine learning algorithms determine the condition and further trigger the criticality (abnormality) in health status Such a system aims to improve health prediction in institutional homes for the overall well-being of participants On the other hand, during social reforms such as the promotion of remote working, there are reports of increased physical and mental stress caused by working in environments other than the workplace. There is also concern that reduced physical activity and more relaxed lifestyles may lead to the onset or worsening of lifestyle-related diseases. Maintaining good health often requires ""persistence"" and ""effort"" to discipline behavior and establish regular lifestyle habits. By accumulating biosensing data on daily activities and analyzing the characteristics of lifestyle habits (diet, exercise and sleep), which are the basic elements of well-being, on a time axis, a method has been acquired to reveal the biorhythmic characteristics of individuals. Combining this with knowledge from human behavioral psychology and behavioral economics, it is important to establish a mechanism to automatically regulate the rhythms of body and mind by presenting and indexing evidence of spontaneous and effortless changes in healthy behavior and developing feedback methods.The body clock that generates the human circadian rhythm is regulated by the input of external light and other information to a specific region of the brain (the suprachiasmatic nucleus). Recent studies have shown that understanding circadian rhythms and eating the right foods at the right time can lead to a healthier diet. In other words, by incorporating a diet that takes into account the body's internal clock into daily life, it should be easy to develop a healthy lifestyle. Chrononutrition has mainly been tested on nocturnal animals such as mice. Evidence is accumulating on the relationship between human circadian rhythms and healthy eating habits [13,14].Social isolation has become a major issue due to the transformation of communities as a result of population decline. The quality of life of older people, especially those who are more socially isolated, needs to be improved.How connected health can be used to address the issue of social isolation and improve social wellbeing, and the effectiveness of interventions based on its use, can be explored.Engaging older adults at the community level can provide technology-based interventions to address social isolation and promote effective practices to increase digital use self-efficacy in the mobility, infrastructure, and environment of the population [15,16].Connected health improves social well-being by using technology to enhance social interactions, support mental health, and foster community connections. Connected health improves the use of video calls and online consultations to make healthcare more accessible, especially for those who have mobility issues or live in remote areas [12,17]. This can improve access to mental health support and reduce social isolation.Healthcare platforms that connect people with similar health conditions or concerns can provide emotional support and practical advice. These groups can also encourage a sense of community and belonging.Connected Health creates or joins online communities focused on health and wellness where members can share experiences, tips and encouragement.In addition, connected health devices provide an understanding of individual health behaviors and deliver tailored interventions or reminders that encourage social engagement and self-care. Also, develop personalized health plans that incorporate social activities or community engagement as part of the overall wellness strategy.Mobile technology-based applications not only help families stay connected, but also connect older adults to health care resources and promote physical and mental health. The use of technology devices will address cognitive, visual, and auditory needs and increase older adults' digital use selfefficacy. We recommend that loneliness interventions be technology-agnostic and multifaceted, providing a wide range of tools that recognize older adults' technological competencies and support different types of interactions to meet individual preferences.Future connected health studies should explore the practical implications of these technologies in real-world scenarios, which are evaluating their effectiveness in different settings such as healthcare, sports rehabilitation, and daily wellness monitoring.As the technology continues to evolve, it is important to further research and understand the effectiveness and long-term impact of these behavior change techniques facilitated by connected health devices. Through the development of new novel connected devices, as well as the algorithms that prevent and predict disease in the field of behavior change interventions, we can strive to improve the physical and mental health condition and quality of life of individuals.From this perspective, the potential of connected health is summarized as a growing area of research in healthcare. These developments present a great opportunity for healthcare systems to proactively predict health problems and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. As the adoption of technology-enabled healthcare services increases to enable healthcare systems to deliver flexible care models, an increasing number of traditional healthcare practices will be augmented or replaced by connected health devices. However, the implementation of connected health devices in healthcare will depend on a clear and robust code of practice for data management, privacy, confidentiality, and cybersecurity related to the supply and use of connected health devices in healthcare. There are still important gaps that need to be addressed in future research related to the connected health technology itself, the healthcare system, and the users of connected health technology. Specifically, future research on connected health technology needs to address how connected health devices can be designed with standardized protocols and interoperability with international and cross-state health care systems. Further research is also needed on the efficiency of blockchain storage compared to centralized, cloud-based storage solutions in the context of connected health care. Finally, consumer and clinician acceptance and digital literacy in the context of using the connected health devices to improve health care delivery and overall experience also needs to be determined. We believe that addressing these areas for future research will go a long way toward enabling broader adoption of the connected health, which can ultimately save healthcare dollars and improve patient-centered care.While well-being research has been actively discussed mainly in the fields of psychology and sociology, there has been little research on the design of information and communication technologies for well-being. However, with the development of wearable devices and contactless device technology, many devices have emerged that can measure daily behaviors without burdening the person being measured. In the future, it will be necessary to design information and communication technologies that have a positive impact on the well-being of individuals and society, while addressing the research challenges.","['technologies', 'well-being:', 'grand', 'challenge', 'connected', 'health']"
Indian Women,2015,"New Delhi—May 28, 2014 is just another day in the life of Neha Rajadhyaksha, a non-governmental organization worker in Mumbai. She spends the best part of her day posting pictures on Instagram and looking at what her friends are posting. She gets her hands on a friend’s phone to post a picture on her Instagram account, and then her phone buzzes. Neha receives a comment from a stranger appreciating the picture she had just posted and persuading her to see her inbox for a similar photo.Excited at the thought of seeing another nice picture, she opens her inbox only to see numerous messages full of abuse. “Fuck You,” reads one of them. “And maybe you teach at an ngo coz u couldn’t survive the mad corporate world. It’s the wasted who join ngos or ppl with old money.” Then, “Get the fuck off fake bandwagon. Ur as fake as a silicon blonde on instagram.” Confused and terrified, her hands are trembling as she tries to hold on to her phone. To clear up any misunderstanding, Neha apologizes to the stranger, then privatizes her profile to avoid any further stress.Minutes later her phone buzzes again, only to find a similar account abusing her and her job again. He is all over her notifications and inbox, attacking Neha across multiple platforms. The slew of horrendous, abusive comments continues, even as she opens and closes new accounts, and blocks repeat offenders. On one hand, Neha is unclear what she has done to provoke such hatred. On the other hand, she is shaken to the core, yet determined to do something to set it straight. Neha approachs her friends to ask for help, and their suggestion further surprises and irks her. Most of them tell her to “let it go,” but she is determined to fight and teach her abuser a lesson. “People are just not aware of the existing online laws,” Neha says. “When subjected to online harassment, women feel helpless and just give up.” But she will not.India is among the leading nations to seize the Internet space and take a leadership role in the global reach of social media. Indian entrepreneurs have made billions off the Internet, and the rise of Indian call centers dragged vast populations on the sub-continent into the 21st century. Tthat this technology has suddenly acquired a dark side, and especially one directed at women, is particularly troublesome to Neha.Neha’s first approach is to the IT cell of the Mumbai Police, where an officer directs her to the Cyber Crime Office. After reaching the office, Neha explains her case to a female constable whose first reaction to the entire issue is, “What is Instagram?” Neha briefs the constable on Instagram, how it works and its nuances, and leaves the office after handing out screen grabs of the profile, the abusive messages, and the URLs of the messengers.Internet penetration in India is growing at a pace that will soon send it past the United States as the country with the second-largest number of Internet users—though both trail China by large margins. Still, since barely 19 percent of the Indian population has Internet access, compared with 85 percent in the United States and 46 percent in China, there is enormous growth potential. As the country brings large numbers of users online, it is imperative to ensure the safety of all users, especially its women. The number of cyber crimes and cases of online harassment in the country is growing at a rate of 107 percent a year. Abusers often conceal their identity and use fake profiles or operate anonymously.“People take social media platforms for granted as they believe abusing anonymously or hiding behind a fake profile protects them and gives them an opportunity to behave as they please,” says Neha. But the women they target are real and often are living both their personal and professional lives through these social platforms. Women don’t have an option to just discard this aspect of life and continue. It’s easy for the abuser and authorities looking into the matter to believe this isn’t real. But for victims it is a harrowing ordeal. Many fail to understand their pain and fear.In an interview with the Internet Democracy Project, a representative from the Mumbai Cyber Police Cell says, “Girls should not face these problems. Girls or females should not find themselves in a position where they have to go to the police. They should not give their personal information and should not post their original photographs on the internet. Anyone can snatch the photograph on the internet and use it for their own purposes. One should do those things to avoid probable offenses.” This is the problem. When authorities fail to understand the grim reality of the situation and treat Internet and social platforms as a pastime, they have a profound effect on victims and how they choose to express their concerns.It seems that being a woman and having an Internet connection are the only two requirements needed to attract abusive online commentary. Here are some of the popular threats being directed at other Indian women in recent years.To Kavita Krishnan, a prominent Delhi-based women’s activist, during an online chat on violence against women on a leading news site in India, a man asked if “he could come rape me using a condom.”To Meena Kandasamy, a writer-activist, for tweeting about a beef-eating festival, she was threatened with: “live-telecasted gang-rape and being torched alive and acid attacks.”Then there’s Sagarika Ghose, a well-known face of Indian television news, who has been threatened regularly with gang rape and stripping on Twitter and whose teenage daughter’s name and school details were tweeted because of her political views. Sagarika now abstains from putting her views on Twitter, but sometimes she does something interesting. She re-tweets some of the abusive tweets to let her followers know about the threats female journalists face.Gul Panag, an actress and activist who entered politics, was subject to much humiliation when users posted her morphed pictures in lingerie with strategically placed accessories.Social media has provided women a platform to express themselves and make their opinions heard. Lately, however, it has become something of a dangerous street where women are often abused virtually. But often it’s simply impossible to deactivate a social account, log off a laptop, switch off the phones, and wish the threats would eventually go away while pretending they never happened. A rapidly increasing number of women use the Internet for a host of reasons—blogging, supporting communities, and running stores or corporations. In short, it’s how they make a living.An increasing number of women in India are being subject to anonymous online harassment. Anonymous because most of the social media profiles who engage in abusing are usually fake profiles. Take a look at any active social media profile of a woman and there will be a raft of obscene comments and threats directed toward her. Whether online or offline, India is hardly the safest place for women. Not even close to safe. According to a recent poll by Thomson Reuters Foundation, polling 370 gender specialists, India is the worst place to be a woman among G-20 nations. And in a country where women are overpowered, suppressed, and denied their value in their home and workplace, it should hardly come as a surprise that humiliation in the streets has extended to the virtual world. Their online lives are causing them severe emotional distress—at the hands of men who think a woman should just shut up, do her household chores, and take her place in his bed.Still, the immediate Indian response is simply, “get off that social platform.” And it would be an all but unanimous response. In a country where dogma and prejudice still govern every action, the woman will be “advised” to step aside and carry on with her life. Even when she isn’t at fault, it will be the woman who’ll be forced to believe these are just threats and should be dismissed as silly. Even though the woman would have barely expressed herself, in her words or attire (yet another subjective issue in India where it is expected women should dress conservatively), it is the woman who must apologize, swallow her self-respect, and bear the immense psychological burden. This is a country where a majority would seek to justify rape and blame it on the attire and outgoing nature of a woman, rather than teaching its men how to behave appropriately with women. This is a society where virtual harassment will be dismissed immediately—hardly considering it as a potentially dangerous stab to the mind and heart of a woman.According to the Internet Democracy Project research study, ‘”Don’t Let It Stand! An Exploratory Study of Women and Verbal Online Abuse in India,” Indian Women develop a variety of strategies to deal with the verbal threats they face. However, these strategies very rarely include the law, according to the research, resulting in a silence around questions of legal effectiveness and recourse for online verbal abuse. The reaction by the Mumbai Cyber Police Cell is a prime example why women rarely invoke the law or police authorities. Also, with cyber laws being relatively new, victims as well as authorities show a lack of know-how in dealing with the issue.The United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women bars “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.” And when it comes to technology-related violence, the definition adds phone, Internet, and social media as platforms that may be used for violence.Until now, the most widely-invoked Internet-related law in India was Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which allowed abusers to be jailed for sending “offensive” messages online. However, due to the vagueness in its provision, it was frequently misused by abusers rather than safeguarding the interests of innocent people. In a recent landmark judgment, the Supreme Court struck down Section 66A of the IT Act—a ruling widely hailed for ensuring the right to freedom of speech in India, which ironically resulted in jailing people whose comments on social media were neither inciting public hatred nor disrupting law and order. Section 66A resulted in more arrests of people posting controversial and sarcastic remarks on politicians rather than defaming or sending “grossly offensive” messages to someone.The Indian Penal Code consists of various sections addressing crimes of verbal abuse against and harassment of women. Section 509 is one such section, which prohibits any words, sounds, gestures, or acts intended to insult the modesty or intrudes on the privacy of a woman and provides for imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or fine, or both. There is another new anti-stalking law, which involves monitoring the electronic communication of a woman. Section 507 of the Indian Penal Code is yet another provision addressing online harassment of women, while pertaining to criminal intimidation by anonymous communications. Any number of laws in India are written to protect women from verbal assaults, but making quick threats has become so easy that the number of such cases is enormous and most ultimately go unchallenged.As the Internet is taking center stage in our lives, the amount of emotional distress the threats cause and the severe backlash it is having on the status of women online are largely grey. And current legislation is designed to protect women from their predicament rather than empower them.Indian policymakers must assure that the speed they are encouraging everyone to get online and connect with each other is accompanied by equally stringent measures to enable the use of Internet safely and privately. The policymakers can do away with vagueness in the existing laws without compromising the freedom of speech and expression. According to the Web Index Report 2014-15, India has a medium score (7 out of 10) when it comes to prosecuting perpetrators, which is exceptional compared to most countries but dismally low (3 out of 10) when it comes to supporting victims subject to online harassment. This is where Indian lawmakers and policymakers need to be more assertive. It cannot be denied that prosecuting perpetrators brings relief to the victim, but having measures in place which support victims and ease their suffering should also be established.Policymakers should also dedicate more funds and training to the authorities who investigate cyber crimes. As in Neha’s case, the local authorities weren’t even aware of Instagram, which further complicates the entire situation. If the authorities do not know the location and nature of the crime scene, how are they ever going to resolve the issue in a timely manner? If the Cyber Crime Office isn’t well-equipped in the form of devices and routine social media platforms, how can someone expect them to solve the case? Lacking such basic utilities, they will be more likely to dismiss the entire case as simply a silly threat.Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube should have mechanisms in place to provide quick and effective redress against technology-related violence. Although the technology companies have provided a virtual band-aid in the form of “Report Abuse” buttons, the problems women face online cannot be solved by a single click of the button. Often, no action is taken by these companies until it becomes a PR disaster, when they are forced to address the issue long after the crime is committed and the perpetrator is gone.A recent report by the Association for Progressive Communications highlighted an alarming lack of transparency around the reporting and redress process. According to the study, Facebook provides the most information online about its reporting process, but there are concerns about how complaints are handled. Little information is provided by Twitter on its reporting process, but the platform does offer significant information about the circumstances under which it will co-operate with law enforcement.Finally, offline social engagement should be encouraged. There should be a greater involvement by local communities, women’s organizations, and other local and national groups in spreading awareness about the laws women may deploy in countering harassment. Women’s organizations are crucial in bringing such issues to the forefront and helping to build pressure on policymakers, molding laws for their benefit. Also, women can take matters into their own hands. They are armed with smartphones and, using their social clout, they can effectively fight harassment, just like Neha Rajadhyaksha who turned to Twitter after none of her friends came to her help. Neha got to know about the laws and cases related to cyber crimes and the address and contact numbers of the IT cell of the Mumbai police from complete strangers on Twitter.In yet another incident recently, a young Indian woman used her smartphone to shoot a video of a man sitting behind her on an airline flight who tried to grope her between the seats. She filmed him in front of all the passengers, rebuked him, and posted the video on YouTube, which attracted millions of views and sparked outrage across social media. This trend to name-and-shame sex offenders is extremely effective as most abusers, especially online, operate anonymously, and nothing can scare them more than revealing their identity in public.Meanwhile, after almost two months, Neha received a call from the IT cell of the Mumbai police informing her that the authorities had apparently identified the person who was harassing her. After a week, she received a string of messages on Instagram from a new account. It was her attacker, who turned out to be a frustrated married man with a family. He was brought to Mumbai, met Neha at the IT cell’s office, and asked for her foregiveness multiple times. She let him go without having him jailed. In the end, she was happy that she stood up for herself. “I am extremely wary about every little comment or interaction I have online these days,” Neha says. “The agony and the mental stress that this verbal abuse brought were just inexplicable.”The Internet is the single most powerful social and technological advance of our time and has the ability to allow all of us to create, compete, and succeed, while transforming our lives. Technology-related violence is one of the biggest challenges we are facing, and policymakers should take the offensive to overcome the technological divide rather than widen it. The power of the Internet can only multiply if it is full of opinions and healthy argument rather than gender-specific abuses. So policymakers should invest every effort to make sure the opinions on this platform are not curtailed but flourish. While over four billion people enjoy no Internet access, policymakers should see that the ones who are a part of it do not get lost in silence owing to the dark acts of a handful of fools.But it still looks like a long shot. In societies such as India’s, the degree of patriarchy combined with an old school political system is overwhelming. Indian governance is male-dominated and controlled by people who are still far removed from the digital age. India’s politics are old, matching ideologies a century in the past. This makes it difficult to shape old laws to suit the modern age and as a result have substantial impact on the lives of women and others who may be marginalized in this society. There should be enough women in the nation’s police force as well as informed and enlightened governance and policy-making to bring normalcy and fresh perspective to law making and crime solving.Considering the rapid growth of the numbers of Internet users, such crimes will only increase. Policymakers should look at filling the gaps in technology used by police forces as well as educating them about the grim realities of threats women face online. More resources must be allocated to fight cases of online harassment, and the respective authorities should cultivate a system where women who face harassment should not feel themselves victimized if they approach authorities for relief or justice. Policymakers can collaborate with citizens as the lawmaking process operates. Being a country where the majority of its population is young, legislative crowdsourcing may be a possibility, with citizens helping policymakers track the latest technology and platforms as well as understanding how existing laws can be molded to reflect the harsh truths of the Internet which changes almost everyday.Still, no number of laws can ensure that online harassment of women is eradicated completely. The problem lies with the society rather than policymaking or legislating bodies. Lawmakers can only make it difficult for abusers and stalkers to operate, but unless we learn to respect women and value their presence and voices, on- and offline harassment will continue to exist.It is time to protect our women while they use this powerful tool to liberate their voices. It is time to ensure that our women may react spontaneously and do not have to think unceasingly before letting the world know how they feel about any given issue. It is time to ensure that positive steps are taken to make the Internet a basic human right where voices of everyone are heard with full respect regardless of their gender, caste, or creed. Now is the time to make sure that Internet use is safe, secure, and private for everyone—and to ensure that it belongs to all.","['indian', 'women']"

A Call to Action for Dissemination and Implementation Science,2021,"""To him who devotes his life to science, nothing can give more happiness than increasing the number of discoveries, but his cup of joy is full when the results of his studies immediately find practical applications."" — Louis Pasteur (As quoted in René J. Dubos, Louis Pasteur, Free Lance of Science (1960, 1986) INTRODUCTION Lots of promising research is not getting into the hands of practitioners and policy makers as efficiently and effectively as needed. According to an article in the Permanente Journal in 2010, the timeline from idea to actionable knowledge may be as long as 17 years … that is, it is estimated that it may take as long as 17 years for ideas to be put into practice … and even then, it's only at 50% implementation (1). Knowing this, what will it take to not only understand how to create the best interventions but also ensure that they are effectively delivered in the applied setting? In 2018, as an introduction to a special issue of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's e-journal Preventing Chronic Disease, we wrote a commentary that provided a brief description of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science, outlined how D&I science and public health practice overlaps and intersects, and highlighted pathways to move public health-focused D&I science forward (2). The pathways presented constitute recommendations for public health professionals to engage in D&I research and practice and, as such, represent a call to action for the field of public health. Here, I reflect on this call to action and provide a perspective on how workplace health and well-being efforts have responded or addressed the recommendations.WHAT IS DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE? D&I science is an emerging field of study that examines the process by which scientific evidence is adopted, implemented, and sustained in typical community or clinical settings (2). First, it is assumed that dissemination reflects efforts that share solutions that have evidence of effectiveness. Thus, evidence-based interventions are the objects of D&I efforts. The dissemination component of D&I is an active approach of spreading evidence-based interventions to the target audience via predetermined channels using planned strategies. The implementation component reflects the process of applying or integrating evidence-based interventions within a specific setting, such as the workplace. The workplace represents a vital implementation site for public health improvement strategies, and efforts are warranted that generate a thorough understanding of how to create the best interventions and how to ensure they are effectively delivered within this specific practice setting. A very basic and high-level perspective of D&I science includes a nested or ecological view of evidence that moves from basic science to applied science. Consider basic, cellular-level research being translated to humans and implemented in practical settings after translation into applied or clinical applications. Such efforts subsequently generate evidence-based practice guidelines. Evidence-based guidelines, in turn, support the implementation of programs in health and community practice settings, and such programs and improvement efforts are evaluated in the real-world context using appropriate methods and outcomes (3–9). THE CALL TO ACTION So, if we agree that an estimated 17 years may be too long for ideas to come into action, how should we go about changing that? What knowledge is needed that would allow us to speed-up the ""translation curve"" (8) and shorten this rather wide gap? To speed-up translation efforts, action steps are needed in the D&I space. Those action steps represent a ""call to action"" and include the following recommendations and examples (2): 1. Leverage existing system drivers to provide opportunities to advance D&I science. Example: Study the process of adoption, adaptation, implementation, scalability, and sustainability of new initiatives to integrate evidence-based principles/practice within your organization. 2. Identify and use an explanatory process and outcome model in your work. Example: Move beyond reporting on the effectiveness of your strategy and include a description of why it worked and how you did it. Use mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) and present the best data available to you. 3. Focus on pragmatic evaluation. Example: Use an iterative learning approach to document the process, outcomes, and effects of new evidence-based strategies. 4. Develop key competencies related to D&I science. Example: Seek out opportunities to build capacity for D&I efforts, e.g., communicate research findings, improve practice partnerships, or understand multilevel context. A RESPONSE TO THE CALL TO ACTION So, what may a response to this call to action for D&I science look like for the field of worksite health promotion? Or, stated differently, what efforts may be useful to highlight in presenting examples of D&I science that align with the recommendations in this call to action? Let's look at these recommendations one at a time and consider them from the perspective of the worksite setting. 1. Leverage existing system drivers to provide opportunities to advance D&I science. Example case: In a study over the course of an 8-year implementation, Äikas and colleagues (10) looked at the process, the adoption, the scalability, and the sustainability of a worksite health promotion program in Finland. This prospective longitudinal quasi-experimental study investigated trends in health risks of a comprehensive, worksite health program. Health risk data were collected from health risk assessments, and health risk changes were investigated across three time periods. Overall health risk transitions were assessed according to low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories. In the overall health risk transitions of the three time periods, most (about 65%) participants stayed at the same risk level, about 20% increased their risks over time, and about 15% of participants improved. Conclusions indicate that the multiyear program was effective in maintaining low and moderate risk levels but fell short of reducing the total number of health risks at the population level. Risk transitions are depicted in the Figure.Figure: Risk transitions across a worksite population over the course of 8 years. Reprinted with permission from Äikäs A, Absetz P, Hirvensalo M, Pronk P. Eight-year health risks trend analysis of a comprehensive workplace health promotion program. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020; 17:9426. 2. Identify and use an explanatory process and outcome model in your work. Example case: A recent case report published in ACSM's Health & Fitness Journal® presents the outcomes of an evaluation among 16 companies that implemented workplace health and well-being programs according to various levels of adherence to nine principles of program design (11). The program design principles were identified following a review of the best practices' literature (12), were subsequently used in the overall program design, and were linked into an evaluation framework that assessed the degrees to which the following occurred: target audience penetration, level of implementation, program participation, and effectiveness (9). Conclusions reached as part of this project include the observation that the more program design principles were implemented, the better the average current health trends over time. Taken together, the models used in this work reflect consistent, well-validated, and replicable approaches to explain the findings of the evaluation. 3. Focus on pragmatic evaluation. Example case: Pragmatic evaluation uses an iterative learning approach to document the process, outcomes, and effects of new evidence-based strategies. In the context of real-world practice-based projects, it can be very difficult to implement research projects. A viable alternative is to conduct a rigorous but realistic evaluation that flows well alongside practice realities and can provide much-needed answers about effectiveness and effect. An example of such a project is the pragmatic evaluation of a weight management program implemented at the workplace (13). This project's goal was to evaluate the fidelity and estimate the effectiveness of a novel health system employee weight management program. Employees participating in a weight loss program consisting of self-monitoring, health coaching, and meal replacements optionally enrolled in the 12-month evaluation. Over the course of 1 year, 140 participants attended 18 coaching appointments and self-reported significant improvements in weight (18.9 lbs of weight loss; 8.2% body weight), body mass index (3.9 kg/m2), fruit and vegetable intake, home food preparation, added sugar, sugar sweetened beverages, and life satisfaction. No significant changes were reported in physical activity, weight-related social support, self-efficacy, or health care utilization. The findings from this evaluation establish implementation fidelity. Clinically significant weight loss, coupled with improvements in many weight-related behaviors, suggest the program is an effective weight management tool when offered as part of a comprehensive employee wellness program. Furthermore, significant improvements in life satisfaction support efforts to goals that address overall worker well-being. 4. Develop key competencies related to D&I science. Example case: Competencies related to D&I science include, among others, building partnerships, making research results highly relevant for the user and understanding how different levels of a workplace relate to the objectives of the program (e.g., frontline staff issues relative to executive-level goals for the program). An example of a multiemployer study of this nature includes a qualitative analysis that describes the process used to build capacity for wider dissemination of a Total Worker Health model using the infrastructure of a health and well-being vendor organization (14). This project was conducted to translate and apply the Harvard Center for Work, Health, and Well-Being's Guidelines for Total Worker Health (15) approaches among several companies. Increased capacity for Total Worker Health solutions was observed as evidenced by the participation, plans of action, and experience ratings of the participating organizations. The conclusions of this study indicate that guidelines, trainings, and technical assistance are feasible to support planning, are readily accepted by companies, and support the application of the Total Worker Health knowledge base into practice. CALL TO ACTION TAKEAWAYS So, did we identify any insights or learnings from these examples that help implement evidence-based approaches to improving health and well-being at the workplace? Well, as it turns out, important observations were noted. These observations may prove helpful for the D&I of workplace safety, health, and well-being programs. They also represent factors that may shorten the time it takes to translate new ideas into practical solutions that are applied, adapted to the local worksite situation, and adopted by companies. The Table presents some of these observations. TABLE - Insights that Reflect Successful D&I Efforts for Worksite Health and Well-Being Programs Key Insights 1 Pragmatic evaluation allows for improvement efforts and delineation of value for leadership 2 Continuous improvement cycles, action research spirals, or iterative changes to programs and services are an integral part of the implementation processes 3 Fully executed and well-coordinated communications plans 4 Visible leadership engagement 5 Dedicated staff resources 6 Ensure that the work environment is optimized to support the healthful behaviors that are being promoted 7 Well-being coverage for employees and spouses 8 Integration of health plan benefits including disease management 9 Personalized access to recommended resources 10 Variety of program offerings (e.g., on site, telephonic, digital) 11 Program participation incentives 12 Cochampions and integrated teams (shared leadership and regular meetings) 13 Plan thoroughly and allow for ramp-up time (as much as 9–12 months for integrated programs) 14 Communicate the planning efforts as this shows significant value to leadership 15 Ensure that materials and guidance are tailored to the real-world realities of workflows and available resources 16 Ensure the active engagement of all stakeholders though options to participate and regular updates and feedback 17 Partner with your vendors and contractors in a way that generates value for both 18 A guiding overarching framework that connects program design and evaluation allows for continuous improvement 19 Know your organizational strategies and how this connects to your goals 20 Learn the terminology your executive team and board uses, i.e., speak the same language 21 Focusing on working condition causes new approaches to be considered 22 Forming integrated teams creates new collaborations and communication structures 23 Using strategic system thinking approaches demonstrates the importance of integrating data across systems and building shared goals Although D&I science continues to emerge and evolve, there is a clear need for practice-based evaluations to be shared more broadly. Real-world experiences, especially those that have been evaluated using robust methods, should find their way into practice-based publications more frequently. As a field, we need to be willing to share what we can show to be effective and efficient in terms of the implementation of evidence-informed approaches to improving safety, health, and well-being.","['call', 'action', 'dissemination', 'implementation', 'science']"
The Efforts of Improving the Professionalism of Lecturers towards the Presentation and Change of KKNI within the University Environment in Aceh,2018,"Abstract Purpose – The aim is to discuss the curriculum of KKNI, it’s said to be still repressive for some educational stakeholders. It is not new about curriculum changes that are often shown to be a troublesome and complicated teaching system, especially for teachers who lack training in curriculum and inadequate facilitation.Design/Methodology/Approach – Research data case study is argumentative research. The elaboration of the case is evidenced by literature review and related articles.Findings – The research results show that research limitations/implications, however, doesnot accessed as a big problem because it only needs an effective approach for teachers (lecturers) who have not fully utilized the method of KKNI. In this paper, the author discusses the positive impact of KKNI on lecturers’ performance aimed at generating Magnum Opus for universities of Aceh region. The level of influence is very high for the next 5 (five) years in the world of college. A variety of effects, among others; the steady standard of operational learning, improving the quality of education oriented to the publication of scientific journals and in the accumulated in prestigious academic journals and improve the quality of research.Originality/Value – The associated with the presence of the new curriculum at universities, especially universities in Aceh is very significant Keywords The Effort Improving of Professionalism Lecturer KKNI Citation Khalsiah, , Asma, N. and Marina, (2018), ""The Efforts of Improving the Professionalism of Lecturers towards the Presentation and Change of KKNI within the University Environment in Aceh"", Proceedings of MICoMS 2017 (Emerald Reach Proceedings Series, Vol. 1), Emerald Publishing Limited, Bingley, pp. 19-25. https://doi.org/10.1108/978-1-78756-793-1-00066 Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited Copyright © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited License Published in the Emerald Reach Proceedings Series.

Introduction An education has a very central role and its function in building a region or country into an advanced and cultured region. Without education, an impossible progress will be embraced. With education, science becomes developed and able to create a high creativity that encourages progress in social, economic, and cultural fields. Even in Islam it clearly affirms that education is very important to humanity and its degree is elevated (The Holy Quran: Al-Mujadalah, verse 11). The perfect integration of systems for educational creativity as stated by Katarina Tomasevski (2003) the education system to be part of its integral structure and its broad social and spatial processes. More precisely, there are political promises aimed at universal primary education every decade since the 1940s. That is, before the global era grew rapidly, education has been exploring the progress line to this day. Gunawan Sudarmanto (2011) added a great educational construction and strongly requires a conscious and planned effort to realize the learning process and integrity of curriculum blend in order to actively learners able to develop their potential. This means the complete design of college curriculum, the readiness of teachers and their roles in the classroom learning as well as full support (morally and materially) related institutions. Associated to all that, the principles set out in the Constitution are in accordance with Article 31 of the 1945 Constitution, paragraph 2, which states that every citizen shall have the right to receive and attend basic education and the government shall finance it. It is the responsibility of the government or the state in promoting its people. Then paragraph 5 in more detail states the government advancing science and technology by supporting high religious values and national unity for the advancement of civilization and the welfare of mankind. The flow of education is not as smooth as imagined. Many obstacles overtake from complex educational processes, changing curricula, difficult-to-adapt stakeholders, complex learners with a variety of characters and demands to be able to produce quality graduates. This paradigm is not an excuse to delay the educational procession but becomes the starting point for seeing the next stream to the stage of change. How is the role of government in realizing educational programs that have educated the nation’s children? What kind of curriculum development is suitable to be implemented as the changes are suddenly impressed? How the reaction of educators among universities alongside KKNI? To what extent can the decision of Education Ministry in Permen ristekdikti able to dignified campus stakeholders in order to get a better education? All of the questions above because of the demands were not just produce prestigious graduates but the contribution of science can also be absorbed in the field work. Supporting from various parties to smooth the process of university environment education trigger the birth of curriculum based on the principle of national education as outlined in the education law. Therefore the curriculum is not only discussed at the elementary to high school level but includes the university level as the delivery of generating productivity in the life of the community. As such, this study is not only a critique but also a suggestion for a university institution because of global demands and change. The persuasive indications are also presented in the presentation of this paper to get closer to KKNI. All university educators must be more pro-active in the governance of curriculum development as well as better prepared to face global challenges towards research-based universities. In relation to the above discussion, the authors want to put forward some things about the stigma of university environment education in Aceh associated with the new regulations that is the presence of KKNI and readiness of teachers in applying the curriculum in question. The authors conducted the research in the Universities of Aceh environment. So, the study was guided by the following research question: 1) How to improve lecturers at the university to face KKNI? 2) What is the role and function of KKNI towards learning at the university level? Research methods, results and discussion, and conclusions and recommendations will be presented following a literature review of relevant theory. 2. Literature review This section will provide a brief overview of the effort in the category to develop lecturers’ potential for curriculum change and qualification requirements for national and international research universities. Conferring to Rehani (2015), the lecturer is an actively involved person in his professional development as an effort to improve the quality of the campus/institution where he teaches. The academic degree must be formal, have the competence of teaching, there is a certification of professionalism that is physical well-being and gain ability to fulfill the desire of national education. The promoter by institutional stakeholders is also influential in improvising the professionalism of a lecturer. The other workshop performances as a first step to recognize self-development and institutions that lead to the quality of teaching and learning environment campus. This has a significant impact on campus ratings. Serambi Indonesia (Dec 07, 2017) LP3M Unsyiah reported that the campus rating is ranked 11th compared to 2016. This result is obtained based on Web metric data scheming is a system to measure the progress of a college through the university website. It can be understood that training or seminars on the progress of the institution closely related to the professionalism of a lecturer. This means to create a research-based university, the role of lecturers is very important. Currently, it has published scientific articles as much as 6,956, 291 books, and 26 patents obtained by scientists. A significant number was taken over the years. Observe the professional development of lecturers (Redjeki, 2015) can be interpreted to maximize efforts to improve the competence, quality of learning, the role of academic teachers in universities. The image of a professional lecturer looks good in the community if it can show attitude to the community that he deserves the example of the surrounding community. The description is strengthened (Soetjipto and Raflis Kosasi, 2011; Redjeki, 2015), among others; legislation, professional organizations, peers, learners, workplaces, leaders, and jobs. Another theory explains the curriculum relationship and potential lecturer developers are interrelated with each other. In detail, Al Mawardi (2011) adds lecturers must have three competencies, namely; designing learning (teaching plan and materials); classroom procedures; and interpersonal skills. These three aspects are described in the college curriculum procedure. As regulated in Permenristekdikti No.44 of 2015 Article 1 defined by Ministry Of Higher Education (2015), KKNI is a set of plans and arrangements regarding graduate learning achievements, study materials, processes, and assessments used as guidelines for the implementation of study programs. KKNI is standing for Indonesia National Qualification Framework. 3. Research methodology Descriptive and argumentative qualitative designs were implemented in this study. The design of the study is to describe the problems faced by lecturers towards changes in college curriculum KKNI and efforts taken to improve their performance. A single-mindedness of the problem to the professionalism of lecturers, curriculum changes, and the presence of KKNI. Young (1994) identified and described some prominent macrostructures of a university lecturer. Data were analyzed through literature review as data acquisition approach. 4. Research finding and discussion 4.1. The effort and improving Quoting (Fabrice Henard & Deborah Roseveare, 2012) as a proactive step, many institutions have implemented specific teaching and learning strategies and have devised mechanisms and instruments to improve the quality of education. With reduced resources and increased competition, these challenges may seem insurmountable, but higher education institutions can, and, help a lot to encourage quality teaching and improve student learning outcomes. The new paradigm of teaching and learning in the field of higher education actually implies: new connections on access to teachers, and wider range of communication and collaboration through learning platforms, re-designing the curriculum, bridging teaching and more intensive research, rethinking student workload and burden, improvements in pedagogy, use of technology, assessment models in line with student-centered learning, creating innovative learning platforms, providing guidance and guidance to students in new ways and methods, assessing impacts and documenting the effectiveness of teaching delivered. Related to the effort and improvisation of lecturers towards the provision of quality education and high standard, According to Hussain( 2005) to produce high-quality human resources, we need high-quality education as well. In fact, in accordance with the demands of global challenges, we need to improve the quality of education from all dimensions so that the standard of education develops as global and international issues. To produce high-quality human resources, we need high-quality education as well. In fact, in accordance with the demands of global challenges, we need to improve the quality of education from all dimensions so that the standard of education develops as global and international issues. The California Master Plan for Education (2003) describes the following components; 1) a qualified and inspirational teacher 2) a ready-made curriculum that can prepare all students for success in post-secondary education, work, and society.3) Textbooks, technology, and teaching materials should be aligned or linear. 4) Service/facilities supporting the adequate learning. 5) Qualified school or college administrators, to nurture an inviting and secure educational culture, and high appreciation of student achievement and teaching excellence. 6) A safe physical learning environment, complete infrastructure advice and well-maintained. All of the above components must be provided to every student enrolled in public education, from preschool to university levels. The peak of the problem is miscalculation or the calculation of campus financial management that has a negative effect on lecturers teaching on both campuses. The authors connectif management is not ready for implementation, then any institution will lead badly. The lecturers and the scientists they invite to join are losers and have no positive effect. The lecturers are less prosperous with honorable salary, to continue the learning process is hampered, the learning situation is not normal even decreased drastically. Are they not qualified? Of course, they are qualified and Highly paid but it was all in vain. The ideal to boost education to advance even the opposite. The role of stakeholders not only seeks the academic potential but also the internal and external potential of the campus that is affiliated to the vision and mission, plus the change and development of new curriculum learning methods. We want all campuses with the capacity and dignity including in Aceh. 4.2. The professionalism of lecturers Ozga (1995) believed that the professionalism of a teacher becomes the basic rule for teachers or teachers in the shift of teacher-state relations. The lack of qualified teachers, community needs, and increased educational opportunities and organized labor force put teachers in a strategic market share and allowed teachers to retain their previously acquired license autonomy (Dale, 1989). In 1950–1960s many factors were combined to strengthen teachers’ autonomy claims and to force states to maintain the rhetoric about rules, partnerships, and professionalism indirectly. Nowadays, the way taken is more elegant and different. All of its aim is to achieve the innovation of a so-called professional. According to the author’s analysis based on case data that appear in the field that there are still teachers or lecturers who have not met the criteria of the measured lecturer. Some private universities have not led to the professional competence in question. As an example; many fictitious practices, remote class opening, compacted lecture schedules, signature engineering evidence of attendance, and falsification of master numbers of dissertation students, as a major condition of graduation, indicated much plagiarism results. Tempo’s search (2017) of the case has occurred at the State University of Jakarta (UNJ). The above phenomenon also does not close the possibility occurs in other areas or even in Aceh, although initially recorded learning programs that are agreed but can be deviated for some reason. Reinforced, the concerns of graduates whose diplomas are not recognized because the campus is not weighted and ultimately difficult to get a job (the author experience is rejected because of the graduate of one of the accredited local universities A). It’s a fact; graduates have become unconfident with the results they have gained from years on their dreams. It needs a serious approach to handlethis great case. All must understand that the quality of the campus is strongly influenced by the work apparatuses in it. Based on the survey results of Kopertis Wilyah XIII-Aceh, there are 109 private universities in the province of Aceh included in the assessment of accreditation. Eight of them are already accredited; Aceh Polytechnic (accredited B), South Aceh Polytechnic, STIA Pelita Nusantara Nagan Raya, STIE Nationality Bireuen, Al Muslim University Bireuen, Gajah Putih University, Jabal Ghafur University Aceh Pidie and Muhammadiah University Aceh accredited C and each listed expired status (Dirjen Kelembagaan IPTEK & DIKTI, 2016). Despite the fact that the accredited ‘A’ is Syiah Kuala University and UIN Ar-Raniry. The above facts show that many private college grounds are not yet in the good category even though they have produced many alumni. Then, it’s closely related to the campus academic community including professional teachers and has qualified graduates. With the best regard to our teachers who have fought in such a way, but the point is to build a synergy between campus elements that take shelter to the best universities in the perceptiveness of society. Sofyan Efendi (2003) in his scientific seminar; Alluding to college governance to overcome the global era should pay attention to the overall order, campus management and able to target student interest. All of it involves the active role of government officials in order to bring positive stigma from the various lines. Hasan Tanang & Baharin Abu (2014) suggested that to improve professionalism, teachers should be involved in activities including; education, teaching and learning process and professional development. Experts argued, professionalism emphasizes the mastery of knowledge management skills and strategies or implementation. 4.3. Curriculum and KKNI Regarding the curriculum, Prof. Dr. S. Nasution, M.A (Kurikulum dan Pengajaran Tahun: 2008)The curriculum is a plan designed to smooth out the teaching and learning process under the guidance and responsibilities of schools or educational institutions and their staff (definitions taken from https://www.scribd.com/doc/53749423/Definitions-of-Curriculum). According to Oxford, Learners’ Pocket Dictionary, the Curriculum is subjects included in a course of study or taught in school, college, etc. Now, the author wants to discuss the college curriculum or the so-called KKNI. The definition is already the author discussed in the literature review chapter. Here, the authors describe the condition of the college curriculum before the standard KKNI by Kemenristek dikti in 2013 ago and newly approved in 2015 means it has been two years running. So what is the composition of KKNI in achieving the target of academic passing for students and the balance for lecturers affiliated related? In this case, Syiah Kuala University has held several workshop or seminars on the curriculum. Not only Syiah Kuala University qualified to facilitate lecturers, but other campuses also do the same. Example Muhammadiah University of Aceh (UNMUHA), the authors saved the soft copy of KKNI faculty Psychology of the university. The contents follow the KKNI edition curriculum procedures that are oriented towards the vision and mission of the faculty, all tailored. But it does not change the content and main purpose of the curriculum. Clear written competence refers to the qualifying parameter 9 contained in the content. Learning Achievements at each level of KKNI are outlined in the description of attitudes and values, abilities, knowledge, responsibilities, and rights with concise statements called generic descriptors. Each descriptor indicates the depth and level of the learning achievement according to the study program level. Determination of Learning Achievement (CP) refers to standards that have been developed by DIKTI. 5. Conclusion and recommendation The present study focused improving the professionalism of lecturers towards the presentation and change of KKNI within the university environment in Aceh, yet it more broadly explored the case. Discussing curriculum issues and targeting the achievement of teaching and learning by lecturers still needs to be straightened out and even followed up to invite to open the insight that the system is not a negative impact but vice versa. Local training and seminars for the improvement of teaching activities can be tailored to the needs of the campus, let alone see the global goal must be university-based research. Many other studies are similar to the author’s idea although the segments are different; the case analysis is correlated with facts and literature studies. As a result, all elements must be actively involved in advancing their own local education to the level of national and even international level.

"Implementation of Smart, Healthy, Age-friendly Environment through an Inclusive Robotic Air Purifier",2023,"A survey conducted in the United States estimates that people spend about 90% of their time inside buildings, mainly distributing activities in their homes and workplaces [1].The same lifestyle of being confined most of the time within enclosed spaces is also prevalent in Europe. This habit provides the opportunity and the right motivation to implement interventions that promote health and livability of the environments in which people live or work. In multiple fields of design discipline, this is translated into a focus on the development of quality indoor spaces that return comfortable environments for the inhabitants to organize, manage and modulate based on their needs and habits.The World Health Organization defines health as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being"" [2]. Thus, inhabitant well-being can be measured not only in the satisfaction of basic human needs related to an individual's physical health, but also in all those intangible aspects related to the psycho-social sphere, such as perceived feelings of security, self-esteem, positivity, mood, and productivity [3].New design paradigms for a ""healthy building"" evaluate a multiplicity of factors that contribute to the determination of living comfort and the resulting qualitative perception of the inhabited space. These include the issue of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) management. The ""inhabitants"" of an enclosed space usually turn out to be exposed not to a single agent, but to a mixture of substances that is generated by the concurrence of several triggers that combine into a potentially harmful mix for the occupants [4].Symptoms resulting from the effects of indoor pollution that are grouped under the acronym of BRI - Building-Related Illness - include specific pathological cases. In this regard the multiple studies on SBS - Sick Building Syndrome - are just one of the many concrete examples of the impact caused by a failure or fallacious management of the issue of indoor pollution [5].The evolving Coronavirus pandemic scenario has revolutionized people's habits, stimulating them to reflect on their condition as ""inhabitants"" forced to occupy enclosed spaces, suffering its negative influence. This reflection has been echoed by a strong awareness of aspects concerning indoor air quality highlighted also by the exponential increase in the market for air treatment devices. The growing attention to indoor air quality is part of the broader changement underway concerning the people's increasing sensitivity to issues relating to the care of their psycho-physical health in all its facets, from simply reducing risk factors to preventing aging.The paper presents a research project, titled APLU, which led to the development of an ion-generating robot that also has the function of a vacuum cleaner. A careful analysis of the state of the art in air purification devices revealed the lack of a holistic approach in the design of these products, whose function is often reduced to a mere assembly of components with embedded digital technologies. The main limitation that emerged is that the devices currently on the market are designed to be fixed, which entails limited coverage of the indoor space, as well as difficulty in interfacing and controlling by users, especially by elders.In this context, APLU aims to increase the usability of a purifier, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction, and to create an inclusive interface, through the integration of advanced technologies, related to the field of robotics and Internet of Things. The final result of the research through design is a robot able to move autonomously within the home, going to cover in its purification activity the entire space of the house based on its sensing capabilities.The transition from a static device to an independent robot in the management of its functions also meets the need to interface with the most fragile categories of users, who are more exposed to the dangers of pollutants. The research project therefore intends to: i) test and validate the possibility of minimizing the user's burden of managing the product; ii) increase its efficiency by equipping it with autonomous intelligence; iii) facilitate the interaction with the device by providing inclusive support and monitoring tools capable of relieving the work of users, especially the elderly; iv) test the acceptability by the elderly, often hostile to advanced technological solutions.","['implementation', 'smart,', 'healthy,', 'age-friendly', 'environment', 'through', 'inclusive', 'robotic', 'purifier']"

"Unite 2O2ONE—Respect, Inspire, Serve",2022,"2021 Summit Snapshot Total attendees: 3407 Member attendees: 1843 Power Huddles: 89 Posters: 57 Overall member satisfaction: 91% (In-person and virtual attendees at live sessions)The 2021 Vizient® Connections Summit brought together more than 3400 members, suppliers, and others to celebrate their work in caring for and supporting patients and communities during the pandemic, provide insights into how to sustain top performance in quality and accountability, and offer perspectives on potential systemic changes and how organizations should prepare for them. Held in November 2021, the summit debuted the hybrid format, with both in-person and virtual options. Members pivoted with Vizient to make this format a huge success. Offering 3 ways to participate, the meeting allowed attendees and speakers to join the summit in person in Las Vegas, attend live virtually, or watch asynchronously through on-demand content—with all formats offering continuing education credits. All participants had access to 89 educational sessions and 57 poster presentations. This innovative format proved quite successful, with attendance almost evenly split between in-person and online. Attendees expressed strong approval for content (91% satisfaction), presentation effectiveness (95% satisfaction), and session format (95% satisfaction). The material represented the best of the best from Vizient members, who submitted 372 abstracts—an impressive number given many competing challenges, priorities, and a national pandemic. This response demonstrates a continued high level of passion and dedication for sharing stories and helping others during these unprecedented times. With attendees gathering in person for the first time in 2 years, Vizient members took time to connect, engage with, and learn from one another, sharing successes and proven strategies for improving patient care—even in the midst of a nonstop pandemic. Hardly a ""sit-and-get"" gathering, the summit was highly interactive, with ample opportunities for in-person and virtual attendees to engage in dialogue with speakers and each other. The power huddles and poster sessions spanned 7 focus areas: reliability, systems of care, growth and sustainability, workforce, supply chain and clinical supply integration, strategies for a high-value pharmacy enterprise, and service line optimization. Not surprisingly, many presenters described their organization's response to the challenges presented by COVID-19 and the innovative ideas and strategies that helped get them through the worst of the pandemic. Much of this work focuses on use of predictive modeling related to capacity, workforce, supply chain, and other pressing issues, often using Vizient databases and analytical tools. The goal is to become more thoughtful and rigorous in anticipating and preparing for the future. Overarching Theme—Unite 2O2ONE: Respect, Inspire, Serve The 2021 theme, ""Unite 2O2ONE: Respect, Inspire, Serve,"" could not have been more appropriate for framing the sessions and discussions. Unity Byron Jobe, president and CEO of Vizient, noted during the opening panel that unity acts as a powerful force—one that has been readily apparent over the past 2 years. Health care workers have faced challenges that most never expected to see in their lifetimes. They continue to have a front-row seat to what many people have experienced only through the news. Separated from their families for weeks and months to protect them from COVID-19, health care's best came together as one to serve patients facing life-altering conditions. They have witnessed heartbreaking loss firsthand, even among their own ranks. By joining forces in the spirit of unity, they have prevented even greater loss and heartache. Consistent with the unity theme, 2021 marked the first time that the spring Vizient Connections Summit (supply chain) became part of the fall Vizient Connections Summit, providing opportunities for providers and suppliers to work collaboratively. In fact, team-based collaboration served as a consistent theme across Power Huddles and Poster Presentations. Attendees were eager to hear about how best to work together in what has clearly become an interprofessional world. Panelists and presenters repeatedly discussed how COVID-19 became an unanticipated catalyst for unity. While the demands of the pandemic kept organizational leaders busy, it also provided an unexpected opportunity to reconnect with loved ones—even while juggling workplace demands. During the opening session, Jobe and all 3 panelists (Sanjay Gupta, MD, neurologist and chief medical correspondent for CNN; Scott Gottlieb, MD, former FDA commissioner; and Marc Harrison, MD, president and CEO of Intermountain Healthcare) discussed how they used their time at home to forge tighter bonds with their families. Gottlieb developed some close, trusting friendships completely through virtual interactions. Perhaps fittingly, for Gupta, the summit served as bookends for his public appearances, with the 2019 summit being his last in-person engagement before COVID-19 and the 2021 gathering being his first since the pandemic began. Respect The theme of respect served as an underpinning throughout the conference—respect among and between administrative leaders, clinical leaders, physicians, nurses, and frontline staff; respect for patient and families; and respect for the greater community at large. The opening panel touched repeatedly on this theme. Panelists talked about access to health care services being a right, not a privilege. The discussion touched on examples of cooperation between tertiary and quaternary hospitals and their community partners involving telehealth, digital platforms, as well as other support to rural providers and communities with a goal of keeping care in local settings. Harrison noted that Intermountain has made this a priority with critical access hospitals for years, helping make Utah one of only a small number of states that has not closed a rural hospital in the last decade. Inspire Inspiration served as another cross-cutting theme. The most inspiring stories came from the many members who discussed how frontline staff continue to come to work every day during a seemingly never-ending pandemic. These heroes have managed against all odds during the most difficult of circumstances. As multiple speakers noted, some sacrificed their lives in doing so—a sacrifice recognized and honored by Jobe and other presenters and attendees. Serve Many sessions touched on the theme of service, often focusing on the need to do a better job serving patients and communities by finally addressing longstanding challenges facing the industry. While these and other challenges existed before COVID-19, the pandemic brought about a sense of urgency in addressing them. This list includes enhancing access to mental and behavioral health services; reducing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities; addressing social determinants of health; and scaling appropriate use of telemedicine, particularly in rural communities. The summit covered various ideas and initiatives that begin to address these seemingly intractable issues. Overcoming some challenges will be easier than others. Perhaps none garnered greater attention than health equity, with multiple panelists and presenters discussing the importance of destigmatizing the issue and calling on organizations to proactively identify, measure, and address inequities and social determinants of health. Several of the most popular Power Huddles and Poster Presentations focused on the issue of health equity. Awards and Recognitions The summit featured multiple awards and recognitions: Sustainer organizations: A panel discussed the Vizient ""Sustainers Study,"" highlighting 5 organizations that have consistently been high performers on the Vizient Quality and Sustainability Study: Mayo Clinic, Rush University Medical Center, University of Utah Health, The University of Kansas Health System, and NYU Langone Health. More details are available in the following article titled ""Sustaining Success During a Once-in-a-Lifetime Pandemic."" Supplier awards: Vizient recognized suppliers and distributors in 14 categories of service excellence. These organizations put forth an incredible effort throughout the pandemic, and this recognition honors their commitment under the most trying circumstances. Volunteer activity: Vizient brought member volunteers together to prepare 2000 care packages, including inspirational messages and nutritious snacks, that were then donated to Three Square Food Bank, which supports the Las Vegas community. Norman Borlaug Humanitarian Award: Vizient honored Ignite, a Chicago-based nonprofit that provides support to youth ages 14–26 who need shelter, primary and mental health care, employment opportunities, and skills to live a healthy and productive life. This award, which includes a $50 000 grant, is named for Norman Borlaug, PhD, an agronomist known for his revolutionary approach to plant breeding. Finally, Vizient recognized the many presenters who developed catchy, creative, and often humorous titles for their work that played an important role in piquing the interest of participants. This led to high attendance, and hence, more exposure to the innovative ideas and the positive impact these projects had on patient outcomes (see pull-out box for a representative sample).Creative Title Examples: Is There a (Supply Chain) Doctor in the House? Thinking Outside the Mask (N95 Alternative) More Bang, Less Bother: Efficiently Maximize Quality by Decreasing LOSI How Not to Strike a Nerve: Engaging Spine Surgeons in Vendor Reduction Getting Better at Getting Better: Intermountain Healthcare Drives Rapid Improvement We Deliver Babies, Not Infections The Game of Life: Care Across the Continuum Three People Walk Into a Clinic: The Patient, the Provider, and the Scheduler Sustaining Success During a Once-in-a-Lifetime Pandemic Julie Cerese, PhD, RN, MSM Group Senior Vice President, Performance Management and National Networks, Vizient David Levine, MD, FACEP Group Senior Vice President, Advanced Analytics and Product Management, Vizient Launched in 2005, the Vizient Quality and Accountability Study identifies top performers quantitatively in terms of quality, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, patient centeredness, and equity. Over the years, Vizient has studied organizational and cultural factors and found that being the best requires 5 key characteristics: a shared sense of purpose; a cooperative leadership style and atmosphere; a results-driven environment that always strives for top performance; centralized and decentralized accountability structures; and a culture of collaboration and respect, with deference to expertise. In 2019, Vizient launched its ""Sustainers Study,"" with the goal of understanding the secret sauce of organizations that have achieved top Quality and Accountability performance over a sustained period. Vizient identified 5 organizations that received top-performer designation consistently since 2005 (including at least the past 2 y): Mayo Clinic (12 times), Rush University Medical Center (11), University of Utah Health (10), The University of Kansas Health System (8), and NYU Langone Health (8). Vizient conducted an in-depth evaluation of 3 of these organizations (Rush, Utah, and Kansas) and assessed a comparison group of 3 similar organizations that had not achieved top-performer status in the last 2 years and had appeared on the list only sporadically (but at least once) since 2005. The Secret to Sustained Success Providing the best patient experience requires a palpable intensity related to the 5 previously mentioned key areas. Nonsustainer organizations also focus on these areas, but not to the degree or consistency that sustainers do. People At top-performing organizations, everyone—leaders, physicians, and staff—has a deep understanding of organizational goals and a high level of intensity and energy around achieving them. Staff members understand they have a critical role in achieving top performance and feel accountable for doing so. Leaders routinely encourage staff to be their best self for patients. The University of Kansas Health System encourages employees to take care of themselves and rely on each other when they have a bad day. The medical staff at sustainer organizations has a remarkably high regard for nursing, with physicians and nurses respecting each other as leaders, colleagues, and team members. At nonsustaining organizations, these same elements exist in certain pockets, but not with the same intensity or consistency. Accountability for results varies across individuals and teams, as does the level of physician engagement, with many physicians lacking confidence in and alignment with executive leadership. Finally, the degree of partnership between physicians and nurses tends to be inconsistent, with hierarchy and legacy cultures and behaviors remaining in place, thus inhibiting collaboration and joint decision-making. Board Support The board has an infectious energy at sustainer organizations. Without apology, board members get highly involved in guiding the organization's success. They are knowledgeable about quality and embrace their role in creating accountability for strong performance. Sustainers are committed to full and complete transparency with the board, sharing the good, the bad, and the ugly. The board routinely evaluates performance versus established metrics. They understand the actions that affect outcomes and expect closure from leaders whenever a performance issue arises. The board spends as much time on quality as they do on finance-related issues. At nonsustainer organizations, boards are often kept at bay, with little transparency about performance. Boards are often distracted with other activities such as credentialing. Wide variation exists as to levels of knowledge and how board members see their role with respect to the quality agenda. Processes At sustainers, organizational priorities are cascaded to units and departments, creating team and individual accountability. Performance is monitored daily through various management systems and processes, including rounding, huddles, just-in-time coaching, and transparent data. An army of problem solvers exists at the unit and department levels that addresses issues in real time. Nonsustainers apply these management systems only sporadically. While there may be a handful of problem solvers and individual pockets of high performance, processes, systems, and expectations remain highly variable and inconsistent. There is heavy reliance on the central team with more sporadic team accountability and innovation. Decision-Making At sustainer organizations, leaders respect and support organizational decision-making processes, even when individual decisions do not go their way. This approach facilitates buy-in to any decisions. Nurse and physician leaders collaborate in an environment of bidirectional mutual respect when prioritizing opportunities and implementing action plans. For their part, staff members are empowered to make independent decisions in the best interests of the patient. This autonomy often leads to rapid improvements. At nonsustainer organizations, relationships between physician and nurse leaders—and the accompanying degree of collaboration—remain inconsistent and highly variable. Titles and hierarchy stifle discussion and influence the quality of decision-making related to priorities and patient care. Consistent Goals and Reliable Metrics At sustainers, the organization establishes a clear north star guiding principle and remains focused and aligned on achieving and sustaining top performance. Embracing data-driven transparency, leaders and staff are never fully satisfied and always looking to reflect and improve. Performance versus established metrics is reviewed daily, weekly, and monthly. At nonsustainer organizations, goals are set to avoid penalties rather than to establish a north star. If a north star is chosen, it often changes every 2 or 3 years. Variation exists across physicians and staff in the degree to which they understand and buy in to organizational goals. Often too many disparate goals and metrics exist, with no clear consistency or coherence connecting them. In many cases, benchmarking and risk-adjustment processes become a source of debate and distraction. Sustainer Case Studies The 2021 Vizient Connections Summit included sessions that featured leaders from the 3 high-performing organizations evaluated in the ""Sustainers Study."" The University of Kansas Health System (Kansas City, Missouri) In 1998, The University of Kansas Health System was in dire straits. Part of the state university system, the organization had some of the worst patient satisfaction scores in the country, high staff turnover (33%), declining patient volumes, dwindling cash reserves, and projected losses of $20 million a year. A consultant produced 3 options for the hospital (the only academic medical center in Kansas): close, be sold, or become a public authority. Organizational leaders convinced the state legislature to pass legislation making the system a public authority, severing formal ties with the university. The new organization received $23 million in cash (enough to last roughly 30 d), along with aging, undercapitalized buildings and equipment. Approximately 2200 former employees joined the new organization. Leaders partnered with them to embark on a remarkable turnaround story that has led to sustained top-notch performance, achieving the Vizient top-performer list 8 times since 2005. Success was driven by an intense focus on the 5 critical ingredients identified in the ""Sustainers Study."" People: The health system unites around the vision of becoming the best in the country in caring, healing, teaching, and discovering. Everyone on campus understands this vision and buys into it. The premise is simple—if every patient has a great experience, the organization will grow and do well financially. Senior leaders do not expect anyone to do anything they are not willing to do. They regularly participate in rounding to understand what patients and staff experience on a firsthand basis. They personally lead major initiatives and meet with area leaders who do not meet targets. Leadership established 7 simple expectations for everyone and created a formula to guide the organization (see accompanying side bar). To strengthen accountability, all 30 000+ employees go through an expert-led customer service training program. Board support: The board sees all data on a regular basis, regardless of performance level. The board regularly has in-depth discussions with leadership about performance, with an eye toward celebrating successes and stimulating improvements. Processes: The organization is ""hard on the process, not the people,"" according to Bob Page, President & CEO. Problems are seldom, if ever, about 1 person, but rather about a process that has failed multiple times. The system uses various performance improvement methodologies, as no single approach works best. The goal is to get things done in as few steps as possible (ideally 1). Decision-making: The organization uses a dyad model that features physician-administrator partnerships. The system is clinically integrated and governed by a single, common board of directors, with no separate departments or organizations. Employing a true partnership model, physicians serve on both the board and executive team. Consistent goals and reliable metrics: Leadership has established a few consistent metrics in a handful of areas—including service, quality, growth, people, and sustainability. While the goal is to be in the top decile in performance, reasonable interim goals are set. Leaders share and discuss performance information at biweekly meetings of 400–500 key individuals. These meetings have used the same agenda and a consistent scorecard for many years, celebrating successes and discussing ways to improve areas of underperformance. Commit to full transparency—both the good and the bad. Be tough on systems and processes, not people. Learn to celebrate successes, even if you're just moving from the 5th to the 10th percentile. After celebrating, move to the next task of improving further. —Bob Page, President & CEO, The University of Kansas Health System Staff take their cues from senior leaders. If it's important to us, it's important to them. —Tammy Peterman, MS, RN, FAAN, NEA-BC, President of the Kansas City Division, The University of Kansas Health SystemAs noted, system leaders created a formula to guide the organization, along with 7 simple expectations of all employees. Together, they have been the foundation of the organization's success.Seven Simple Expectations We are all here for 1 reason: patient care—providing the best care and support to patients and families. There can be no bad days in front of patients or families. Staff can have a bad day, but they must do so behind the scenes, where they can rely on fellow team members for support. First impressions matter. They always have and always will. Everything we do, we do as a team. Team members must be respectful of each other across disciplines and provider types. We must become the safest, most efficient organization in the country; safety always comes first. New employees are encouraged to speak up if they see something that could compromise safety. Be proud of where we are, but never satisfied with it. Strive to be better teammates and communicators. Own everything that's yours and a little bit more. Make sure that nothing falls through the cracks and make it a habit to do something not in your job description. Rush University Medical Center (Chicago, Illinois) A top performer 11 times since 2005, Rush University Medical Center succeeds because of its strong commitment to setting aggressive goals, consistently measuring performance against those goals, and addressing problems as they surface. Once again, the secret sauce lies in the 5 critical ingredients: People: Rush's leadership has established a clear mission—to improve the health of the community it serves. Without a true north to serve as a guiding principle, organizations falter during difficult financial times or due to social pressures. Leaders also establish aggressive, mission-related goals, strategies for achieving those goals, and clear expectations for everyone associated with the organization. These steps make it easy to attract, hire, and retain the right people, because everyone buys into what the organization is trying to achieve. Board support: The board fully embraces the mission and focus on quality and outcomes. It regularly receives and reviews fully transparent performance data. The board supports Rush's efforts to do what is right for the community, even when such activities may come at the expense of other priorities, including financial considerations. Processes and decision-making: Rush operates with the premise that everyone is trying to do well. The problem rarely lies with a person or group, but rather with underlying processes. Data shines a light on the problem, and key stakeholders work together to address it. A close collaborative relationship exists between clinical and administrative teams. Neither side leads the other; the 2 groups make decisions as true partners. Consistent goals and reliable metrics: Rush establishes clear, aggressive goals on established metrics and consistently measures performance against those goals. The organization regularly celebrates successes while simultaneously addressing identified problems. Health care is full of good people. But they are being pulled in too many directions. Leaders must provide clarity about what we're trying to achieve . . . an organization has an entirely different feel when clinical leaders are not aligned with administration. You can tell in about 5 minutes. —Omar Lateef, President and CEO, Rush University Medical Center University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah) A top performer 10 times since 2005, the University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics similarly focuses on the critical ingredients to sustained success: People: The organization demonstrates a clear commitment to employees through compensation and by promoting an appropriate work-life balance to ensure that staff remain healthy and engaged. Leaders communicate and reinforce this commitment, acknowledging the critical role that everyone plays. Leaders emphasize the core values of mutual respect, trust, and teamwork. These values resonate with staff members, who routinely cite their relationships with teammates and coworkers as the reason they come to work each day. Board support: Board members are extremely engaged and focused on what is important to the organization. Individual board members have expertise in quality improvement methodologies and regularly query leaders about what they have learned during rounding from frontline staff and patients. Processes and decision-making: The organization's emphasis on people translates into collaborative, mutually respectful, nonhierarchical decision-making. Quality improvement processes such as Lean focus on fixing systemic problems rather than calling out individuals. Consistent goals and reliable metrics: The organization's improvement journey began 14 years ago with the establishment of specific goals related to providing an exceptional patient experience and high-quality care while maintaining financial stability. Clear metrics cover each of these areas, with regular measurement, monitoring, and feedback against these goals. Never give up a long-term relationship for a short-term gain. Acknowledge what your people do, support them, and lift them up every day. —Dan Lundergan, MHA, CEO, University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics Sustaining Excellence During a Pandemic At no time have the 5 critical ingredients been more important than during the pandemic. Sustainer organizations have enjoyed even greater relative outperformance since 2019 than they did before the pandemic. The reason is simple: the cultures and systems in place at these organizations allow them to make decisions and take actions that many others simply cannot, as illustrated by the examples below. The University of Kansas Health System When COVID-19 hit, The University of Kansas Health System doubled down on what made it successful. As a result, performance improved in 2020 compared to the year before. The secret was staying true to the formula and the people who make up the organization. In April 2020, senior leaders announced there would be no staff layoffs or furloughs—even though the system was generating only 40% of prior-year revenues. The reasoning was simple—engaged staff are critical to the previously described guiding formula, and a global pandemic was no time to deviate from that formula. At the end of the day, it's about having a sustained, consistent culture—it's what we have built and what has led to our success over the last 20 years. —Tammy Peterman, MS, RN, FAAN, NEA-BC, President of the Kansas City Division, The University of Kansas Health System Rush University Medical Center Because COVID-19 did not hit Chicago immediately, Rush had the opportunity to learn from others. Supported by a culture that discourages egos and values humility, Rush leaders began gathering information from those in early hot spots such as Seattle and New York. Rush created a dedicated triage area and put extra intensive care unit beds and equipment in place before patient zero arrived. Because no one knew what to expect, Rush's leaders emphasized to employees the need to be open and honest about what they were learning every day. To keep staff engaged, leaders remained highly visible. The board also played a critical role, making it clear that Rush would be led by its values and continue putting patient outcomes first. Facing $10 million in losses a week, the board chair approved the idea of Rush taking safety-net transfer COVID-19 patients from everywhere, including the uninsured and those without documentation. Rush expanded capacity to handle these patients, including installing equipment in areas not traditionally used for patient care. We didn't have to do a lot of the things we did when COVID hit. But it's a part of who we are. We all came together to deliver for the community. —Omar Lateef, President and CEO, Rush University Medical Center As the ""Sustainers Study"" and these case histories illustrate, achieving top performance over a sustained period requires a palpable intensity related to 5 areas: people, board support, processes, decision-making, and consistent goals and reliable metrics. Paying attention to these areas drives sustained excellence under both normal circumstances and during unprecedented challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. A New Growth Formula: Relevance, Diversification, and Scalability Joan Moss, RN, MSN Managing Principal and Chief Nursing Officer, Sg2, a Vizient company John Becker Group Senior Vice President, Strategic Growth Solutions, Vizient As the United States and the world slowly transition to an endemic phase of COVID-19, hospital and health system leaders finally have time to breathe again, to turn at least some attention away from day-to-day crises and think again about long-term imperatives like growth and capital planning. Senior executives are having strategic conversations again, including discussions about how to restart growth. Surveys of Sg2® members conducted during the November 2021 Sg2 Executive Summit signaled unequivocally that growth was at the top of the agenda for 2022, an unsurprising finding after 2 years of pandemic-induced volume disruptions.

"Dying for an iPhone: Apple, Foxconn, and The Lives of China's Workers by Jenny Chan, Mark Selden, and Ngai Pun",2022,"Reviewed by: Dying for an iPhone: Apple, Foxconn, and The Lives of China's Workers by Jenny Chan, Mark Selden, and Ngai Pun Lishu Tang Jenny Chan, Mark Selden, and Ngai Pun. Dying for an iPhone: Apple, Foxconn, and The Lives of China's Workers. Haymarket Books, 2020. 273 p. Dying for an iPhone discloses the real lives of Chinese workers at Foxconn, one of the worlds' leading electronics workshops, especially well known for manufacturing Apple products such as iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Macs. While consumers worldwide are quite familiar with the trending and high-tech digital devices sold by Apple, they hardly know the suffering of the Chinese workers who spend day and night assembling iPhones and other electronic products. Dying for an iPhone thoroughly portrays the pain, violence, and struggles encountered by Foxconn workers. It accuses Foxcnn of inhuman management and treatment towards its employees, as well as Apple's negligence and labor violations. It further calls for domestic and international action to protect workers' rights. To investigate Foxconn's labor issues, the scholars did many years of firsthand research and fieldwork in Foxconn's primary manufacturing bases in nine cities in mainland China. They not only interviewed different groups of people, including ""Foxconn employees, student interns, teachers (who monitor the internship programs of their students), managers, and government officials,"" but also collected many documentary materials such as ""poems, songs, open letters, photos, and videos"" (12). Chapter 1 focuses on the story of suicide survivor Tian Yu, a 17-year-old girl who was half-paralyzed after jumping from the Foxconn Longhua factory dormitory. Tian Yu's own narrations of her experience and feelings about working at Foxconn unveils how workers like her become submerged by desperation due to exhausting workdays, strict [End Page 134] supervision of line leaders, social isolation, and delayed salary payment. The following chapter introduces the history and business of Foxconn, originally a plastic and metal processing company set up by Terry Gou in Taiwan that later became the largest electronics manufacturer in the world as well as the ""biggest private sector employer"" in China (26). Foxconn's development is heavily dependent on low labor cost in China. The rural migrant workers employed by Foxconn are trained as ""harmonious men"" or ""Foxbots"" who are expected to work tirelessly like robots. Chapter 3 discusses the intimate relationship between Apple and Foxconn. It further shows how Apple has been damaging the welfare of Chinese workers in various ways that have violated China's labor laws and Apple's ""own supplier code of conduct"" (33). Chapter 4 examines Foxconn's management system and concludes that instead of developing effective methods to increase wages or improve workers' wellbeing, Foxconn continues to enforce strict regulations over its employees, who are considered ""animals"" by Terry Gou. Chapter 5 focuses attention on the experience of abused student interns. Abundant statistics demonstrate how Foxconn cooperates with the Chinese government, vocational schools, and teachers to use the student labor force to save money. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 delineate various challenges that migrant workers have encountered at the workplace. In addition to low wages, Foxconn workers are also put in physical danger. For example, polishing workers have to breathe toxic aluminum dust while working in the airtight environment. The metallic dust can also be ignited and lead to fire and explosions, which happened in 2011 and caused the deaths of four workers. Chapters 7 and 8 use poems written by Foxconn workers to show their unsettled lives in big cities. As individuals who left their hometowns in rural areas to make a living in a strange land, young workers often feel lost and hopeless for their future. Some fail to gain a sense of belonging and to deal with ""fantasy"" and ""reality"" while working in the modern city (98). After briefly discussing the environmental crisis caused by Foxconn, Chapters 10 and 11 concentrate on workers' efforts to protect their legal rights. Even though they applied various strategies to fight against unfair treatment from Foxconn, such as labor arbitration, [End Page 135] appealing to the courts, work slowdowns, labor actions, suicide threats, riots, and seeking help from unions, they failed to change or improve...","['dying', 'iphone:', 'apple,', 'foxconn,', 'lives', ""china's"", 'workers', 'jenny', 'chan,', 'mark', 'selden,', 'ngai']"
Quantifying Behaviour Change in reducing environmental impact within large organisations - 3 case studies from the UK,2016,"Event Abstract Back to Event Quantifying Behaviour Change in reducing environmental impact within large organisations - 3 case studies from the UK Andrew F. Smith1* 1 ZapCarbon, United Kingdom In the field of environmental impact reduction, Behaviour Change has not traditionally been regarded as an easy route to achieving substantial results. Arguably this is driven by perceptions that it is (i) difficult to influence large numbers of people, and (ii) difficult to quantify the potentially nebulous results generated. This paper proposes that by use of innovative and engaging IT systems and good programme design, both of these challenges can be addressed. By so doing, Behaviour Change can be systemized and used within large organisations as a useful route to achieving significant reductions in environmental impact. It reviews examples of such Behaviour Change programmes within 3 large organisations within the UK and highlights the impact of the IT-enabled approach. BACKGROUND Public Sector organisations within the UK have a legal mandate to reduce their Carbon footprints. In developing their Carbon management plans, most have included staff engagement as an element of their approach. The author, working with ZapCarbon Ltd., has taken this as an opportunity to develop innovative modular behaviour change systems for such organisations. Novel IT platforms have been central to their successful operation. (Examples at www.cranfieldgreen.co.uk, www.ougogreen.co.uk and www.beeslondon.co.uk ) Programmes on three university campuses are reviewed in this paper (University of London, Open University and Cranfield University). In all cases, programmes have been run for a minimum of 2 years, and the latest results are presented. The aim of the programmes has been to give the organisations cost-effective routes to engage staff, develop their capabilities with regard to environmental improvement and measure the results they achieved. DESCRIPTION The approach taken focuses on integrating and enabling local “energy champions” by means of innovative IT platforms. The paper includes the iterative design process behind these online platforms, which was geared to achieving a number of roles, including: - awareness raising, - facilitating peer pledging of support - inter-champion communication - team building - fostering competitive spirit towards goals - tracking energy-saving actions taken - displaying energy consumption data & resultant changes Well-designed IT systems have been a key enabler in allowing the programmes to operate in a manner that encourages efficient & effective operation. Not only does champion interaction increase as a result of better engagement, but the unit cost of the programme can be kept low, thereby increasing the return on investment for the organisation. The results from the three sites are presented in this paper. Within all three organisations, the champion density was around 1 - 2% (ie: 1 - 2% of staff population chose to become champions). These champions were given specific tasks, all of which centered around the online platform. The system included automated messaging to mobile phones and results-based feedback in real time. To raise awareness across the organisation, champions asked fellow staff to pledge their support online. From this action, between 25 – 40% of the organisations’ populations were reached (ie: several thousand staff members) and as a consequence, became linked in to the programme’s aims. Using an online Action monitoring system, champions self-selected energy-saving actions to undertake within their workplaces. When these were performed, champions recorded these on a live Actions Feed. The immediate effect of such actions was a reduction in energy demand. However, the cumulative social effect of displaying the champions’ actions online was to create an enhanced momentum to the programme and competitive motivation between champions. Reflecting data back to champions on the effects of their actions is a powerful tool. Where metering of energy consumption exists, this is done in close to real time. Champions can thus observe the magnitude of their changes within their workplaces and learn which changes have the greatest energy-saving potential. Many results are presented in which champions have reduced their building’s energy consumption by over 20%, and a smaller number where reductions of over 50% have been achieved. In total, these programmes have saved the organisations substantial amounts of money and avoided CO2 emissions. Analysis has shown that the three universities are currently benefitting by over £320,000 / year and 1,300 tonnes of avoided CO2, as behavioural-led changes have already reduced demand by between 5% and 8%. Figure 1 shows the savings made by one university, and demonstrates a 99kW reduction in electricity demand that has been created through staff behaviour change. CONCLUSIONS Effecting behaviour change within large organisations has always been difficult owing to the large numbers of people involved, the slow speed of feedback and the difficulty in quantifying results. This work shows that well-designed IT systems are a key enabler in overcoming all of these challenges. IT has permitted and facilitated the following: Community building, awareness raising, quantification of savings, feedback on actions, competitive activity and rapid reporting. The results from these programmes have helped three universities to cut their electricity consumption by between 5% and 8%, with potential for greater future cuts. Collectively, as a result of this mechanism, the three universities are reducing their environmental impact by over 1,300 tonnes of CO2 per year. The implications for other areas of behaviour change are significant. Potentially the lessons learned in these IT-enabled environmental impact reduction initiatives can be translated into other fields (eg: other health, organisational change, etc).

,2022,"Health is central to the development of any country. Nigeria's gross domestic product is the largest in Africa, but its per capita income of about ₦770 000 (US$2000) is low with a highly inequitable distribution of income, wealth, and therefore, health. It is a picture of poverty amidst plenty. Nigeria is both a wealthy country and a very poor one. About 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, in social conditions that create ill health, and with the ever-present risk of catastrophic expenditures from high out-of-pocket spending for health. Even compared with countries of similar income levels in Africa, Nigeria's population health outcomes are poor, with national statistics masking drastic differences between rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and different regions. Nigeria also holds great promise. It is Africa's most populous country with 206 million people and immense human talent; it has a diaspora spanning the globe, 374 ethnic groups and languages, and a decentralised federal system of governance as enshrined in its 1999 Constitution. In this Commission, we present a positive outlook that is both possible and necessary for Nigeria to deliver equitable and optimal health outcomes. If the country confronts its toughest challenges—a complex political structure, weak governance, poor accountability, inefficiency, and corruption—it has the potential to vastly improve population health using a multisector, whole-of-government approach. Major obstacles include ineffective use of available resources, a dearth of robust population-level health and mortality data, insufficient financing for health and health care, sub-optimal deployment of available health funding to purchase health services, and large population inequities. Nigeria's demographic dividend has unguaranteed potential, with a high dependency ratio, a fast-growing population, and slow reduction in child mortality. Effective, quality reproductive, maternal, and child health services including family planning, and female education and empowerment are likely to accelerate demographic transition and yield a demographic dividend. This Commission was written in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has laid bare the inability of the public health system to confront new pathogens with threats to human health. However, despite a history of weak surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure, the scale up of COVID-19 diagnostics suggests that it is possible to rapidly improve other areas with sufficient local effort and resources. The Lancet Nigeria Commission aims to reposition future health policy in Nigeria to achieve universal health coverage and better health for all. This Commission presents analysis and evidence to support a positive and realistic future for Nigeria. The Commission addresses historically intractable challenges with a new narrative. Nigeria's path to greater prosperity lies through investment in the social determinants of health and the health system. Nigeria is not making use of its most precious resource—its people—by not adequately enacting policies to address preventable health problems. Health is influenced by access to quality health services, but other influencing factors lie outside this sphere. Huge gains in health can and must be made by ensuring adequate sanitation and hygiene, access to clean water, and food security, especially for children, and by addressing environmental threats to health, including air pollution. Nigeria has a young population, yet, despite spending more on health than many countries in west Africa (mostly from out-of-pocket payment), Nigerians have a lower life expectancy (54 years) than many of their neighbours. Nigeria's lower life expectancy is partially due to having more deaths in children of 5 years and younger than any other country in the world, including more populous India and China and countries experiencing widespread long-term conflict, such as Somalia. Chronic diseases and a high infectious disease burden, and an ever-present risk of epidemics of Lassa fever, meningitis, and cholera, present additional challenges. A rising population and inadequate infrastructure development over the past 30 years have contributed to increasing deaths from trauma through road injuries and conflicts driven by inequitable distribution of resources. Addressing Nigeria's health challenges requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to prevent ill health. This means investing in highly cost-effective health-promoting policies and interventions, which have extremely high cost–benefit ratios, and offering clear political benefits for implementation. Interventions are needed to improve child nutrition, reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution, address unmet family planning needs, and improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Key messages•We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state. Health is a unique political lever, which to date has been under-utilised as a mechanism to rally populations. Good health can be at the core of the rebirth of a patriotic national identity and sense of belonging. A commitment to a ""One Nation, One Health"" policy would prioritise the attainment of Universal Health Coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, who also bear the highest disease burden.•We recommend that prevention should be at the heart of health policy given Nigeria's young population. This will require a whole-of-government approach and community engagement. An explicit consideration of equity in the implementation of programmes and provision of social welfare, education and employment opportunities should be paramount.•We propose an ambitious programme of healthcare reform to deliver a centrally determined, locally delivered health system. The goal of government should be to provide health insurance coverage for 83 million poor Nigerians who cannot afford to pay premiums. Implementation of a reinvigorated National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP III) should be supported by structured and explicit approaches to ensure that Federal, State and Local Governments deliver and are held accountable for non-delivery. NSHDP III should be supported by a ring-fenced budget and have a longer horizon of at least a decade during which common rules should apply to all parts of the system.•At the same time, the system should encourage innovation. Future health system reform should engage communities to ensure that existing nationally driven schemes have local buy-in and are sustainable. Further, since more than 50% of health services are provided in the private sector, often with poor quality and high costs, reforming the policy and regulatory landscape to unleash the market potential of the private sector is important.•We outline options for improving health financing and ensuring better accountability and distribution of resources. The rationalised governance schemes we have proposed should improve the efficient use of existing resources devoted to health. Ultimately, the proportion of spending allocated to health needs to be increased. We envision a future of Nigeria's health without foreign aid. This will require substantial increase in domestic investments. Foreign aid (multilateral, bilateral, and philanthropic) has led to fragmentation of the already complex health development landscape, with huge asymmetries in legitimacy between foreign actors and the Nigerian state as well as weak accountability. Defragmenting and decolonizing the Nigerian health landscape requires domesticating health financing.•We recommend a whole system assessment of the invest-ment needs in Nigeria's health security. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Nigeria's health security system. Nigeria needs better manufacturing capacity for essential health products, medicines and vaccines, the provision of diagnostics, surveillance and preventive public health measures in health facilities and community settings, as well as other preventive and curative measures.•We call on the Federal Government, working with state governments, to fund and lead the development of standards for the digitisation of health records and better data collection, registration and quality assurance systems. A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation. •We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state.

A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation. We call for the thoughtful use of existing institutions as an approach to achieve better governance and prioritisation of health. Although corruption has undermined the Nigerian health system, we can harness existing institutions for the benefit of population health. All levels of Government in Nigeria (federal, state, and local), and traditional leadership structures, civil society, the private sector, religious organisations, and communities, influence health. Efforts towards a balance between centralisation and localisation should focus on common policies, standards, and accountability. Concurrently, there is an equal need for localisation of implementation, meaning actual community and local government ownership of health service delivery. All three levels of Government are crucial, and we provide recommendations for each level. Differences in regional needs and context must also dictate programmes and interventions. What is needed in the northeast, in a context of ongoing insecurity and a crisis of internally displaced persons, is quite different from needs in wealthier, more secure urban centres, or in the face of the different level of insecurity found in oil-producing areas in the Niger Delta. Prioritisation of health requires additional funds. We have provided a clear investment case on health to convince politicians and governments that improved population health will reap political, demographic, and economic dividends. Our call for a whole-of-government approach to health will allow the delivery of multisectoral policies to address the social determinants of health, prioritise health-care expenditure to major causes of burden of diseases, and substantially increase healthy and productive lifespans. Nigeria's health system was built in an ad hoc way, layering traditional community health systems with colonial medicine aimed at maximising resource extraction. This origin has resulted in inbuilt inequalities, a dysfunctional focus on curative care, and a detrimental social distance from users and communities. Post-independence policies to redress problems have only been partially implemented. However, the current health system is sprawling, multifarious, disintegrated, and frequently inaccessible, with very minimal financial risk protection and low financial accessibility of services. Nigerians variously seek care from medical personnel and auxiliaries, community health workers, medicine vendors, marabouts and spiritual healers, traditional birth attendants, and other informal providers. The system relies on a mixture of quasi-tax-funding, fee-for-service, and minimal health insurance coverage. What kind of health system do Nigerians deserve, and should the country's leaders work towards? The core need of most Nigerians today is for accessible basic health services, and for this to be achieved, improvements in public sector delivery supported by an enhanced complementary private sector, including faith-based organisations, is the way forward. We lay out a path for Nigeria to move towards a system that, although remaining diverse, better serves the needs of the population. Within this diversity, we believe there is an opportunity for a ""one nation and one health"" approach, whereby Nigeria guarantees a minimum standard and delivery of health care for all with an emphasis on strengthening public and private (including faith-based and non-profit) systems. Nigeria should also leverage the private sector for certain functions, such as expanding innovation, discovery, and manufacturing capacities to claim a leadership role on the African continent and globally. Government investment in private industry should be mission-driven, supporting innovation and claiming dividends for society from its investments. Core functions of the health system require immediate attention, in particular, good quality health data. This Commission strongly recommends better recording, storage, and use of data. Paper systems are unworkable. A drive towards digitisation can result in major improvements, for both patient care and devolved health decision-making. Mobile digital technologies should allow a relatively rapid expansion of population health data and linked existing datasets. Human resources in rural and poor regions of the country are worsened by brain drain. We propose prioritising the optimal development and redistribution of health workers at all levels. A viable health system requires dedicated, efficient, and equitable health financing mechanisms, complemented by optional health insurance. Countries with systems comparable with Nigeria's, such as Ethiopia and Indonesia, have planned or implemented ambitious programmes to deliver health insurance coverage.","['lancet', 'nigeria', 'commission:', 'investing', 'health', 'future', 'nation']"
